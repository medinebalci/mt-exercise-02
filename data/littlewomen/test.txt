Act <unk> opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro .
He wishes her to go into a <unk> , but she won &apos;t hear of it ; and , after a touching appeal , is about to faint , when Roderigo <unk> in and <unk> her hand .
Don Pedro <unk> , because he is not rich .
They shout and <unk> tremendously , but cannot agree , and Roderigo is about to bear away the exhausted Zara , when the timid servant <unk> with a letter and a bag from Hagar , who has mysteriously disappeared .
The latter <unk> the party that she <unk> <unk> wealth to the young pair , and an awful doom to Don Pedro , if he doesn &apos;t make them happy .
The bag is opened , and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage , till it is quite glorified with the <unk> .
This entirely <unk> the &quot; stern sire &quot; : he <unk> without a murmur , all join in a joyful chorus , and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro &apos;s blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace .
&#91; Illustration : The lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro &apos;s blessing &#93; <unk> applause followed , but received an unexpected check ; for the <unk> , on which the &quot; <unk> &quot; was built , suddenly shut up , and <unk> the enthusiastic audience .
Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to the rescue , and all were taken out <unk> , though many were <unk> with laughter .
The excitement had hardly subsided , when Hannah appeared , with &quot; Mrs. March &apos;s compliments , and would the ladies walk down to supper . &quot;
This was a surprise , even to the actors ; and , when they saw the table , they looked at one another in rapturous amazement .
It was like Marmee to get up a little treat for them ; but anything so fine as this was <unk> since the departed days of plenty .
There was ice-cream , <unk> two dishes of it , pink and white , --and cake and fruit and distracting French bonbons , and , in the middle of the table , four great bouquets of <unk> flowers !
It quite took their breath away ; and they stared first at the table and then at their mother , who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely .
&quot; Is it fairies ? &quot;
asked Amy , &quot; It &apos;s <unk> <unk> , &quot; said Beth .
&quot; Mother did it &quot; ; and Meg smiled her sweetest , in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows .
&quot; Aunt March had a good fit , and sent the supper , &quot; cried Jo , with a sudden inspiration .
&quot; All wrong .
Old Mr. Laurence sent it , &quot; replied Mrs. March .
&quot; The Laurence boy &apos;s grandfather !
What in the world put such a thing into his head ?
We don &apos;t know him ! &quot;
exclaimed Meg .
&quot; Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party .
He is an odd old gentleman , but that pleased him .
He knew my father , years ago ; and he sent me a polite note this afternoon , saying he hoped I would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day .
I could not refuse ; and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the <unk> breakfast . &quot;
&quot; That boy put it into his head , I know he did !
He &apos;s a capital fellow , and I wish we could get acquainted .
He looks as if he &apos;d like to know us ; but he &apos;s bashful , and Meg is so prim she won &apos;t let me speak to him when we pass , &quot; said Jo , as the plates went round , and the ice began to melt out of sight , with &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
and &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
of satisfaction .
&quot; You mean the people who live in the big house next door , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
asked one of the girls .
&quot; My mother knows old Mr. Laurence ; but says he &apos;s very proud , and doesn &apos;t like to <unk> with his neighbors .
He keeps his grandson shut up , when he isn &apos;t riding or walking with his tutor , and makes him study very hard .
We invited him to our party , but he didn &apos;t come .
Mother says he &apos;s very nice , though he never speaks to us girls . &quot;
&quot; Our cat ran away once , and he brought her back , and we talked over the fence , and were getting on capitally , --all about cricket , and so on , <unk> he saw Meg coming , and walked off .
I mean to know him some day ; for he needs fun , I &apos;m sure he does , &quot; said Jo decidedly .
&#91; Illustration : We talked over the fence &#93; &quot; I like his manners , and he looks like a little gentleman ; so I &apos;ve no objection to your knowing him , if a proper opportunity comes .
He brought the flowers himself ; and I should have asked him in , if I had been sure what was going on upstairs .
He looked so wistful as he went away , hearing the frolic , and evidently having none of his own . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a mercy you didn &apos;t , mother ! &quot;
laughed Jo , looking at her boots .
&quot; But we &apos;ll have another play , some time , that he _ can _ see .
Perhaps he &apos;ll help act ; wouldn &apos;t that be jolly ? &quot;
&quot; I never had such a fine bouquet before !
How pretty it is ! &quot;
And Meg examined her flowers with great interest .
&quot; They _ are _ lovely !
But Beth &apos;s roses are sweeter to me , &quot; said Mrs. March , <unk> the <unk> posy in her <unk> .
Beth nestled up to her , and whispered softly , &quot; I wish I could send my bunch to father .
I &apos;m afraid he isn &apos;t having such a merry Christmas as we are . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : <unk> apples and crying over the &quot; Heir of Redclyffe &quot; &#93; <unk> .
THE LAURENCE <unk> .
&quot; Jo !
Jo !
where are you ? &quot;
cried Meg , at the foot of the garret stairs .
&quot; Here ! &quot;
answered a <unk> voice from above ; and , running up , Meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the &quot; Heir of Redclyffe , &quot; wrapped up in a <unk> on an old <unk> sofa by the sunny window .
This was Jo &apos;s favorite refuge ; and here she loved to <unk> with half a dozen <unk> and a nice book , to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet <unk> who lived near by , and didn &apos;t mind her a particle .
As Meg appeared , Scrabble whisked into his hole .
Jo shook the tears off her cheeks , and waited to hear the news .
&quot; Such fun !
only see !
a regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for to-morrow night ! &quot;
cried Meg , waving the precious paper , and then proceeding to read it , with girlish delight .
&quot; &apos; Mrs.
Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a little dance on New-Year &apos;s Eve . &apos;
Marmee is willing we should go ; now what _ shall _ we wear ? &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s the use of asking that , when you know we shall wear our <unk> , because we haven &apos;t got anything else ? &quot;
answered Jo , with her mouth full .
&quot; If I only had a silk ! &quot;
sighed Meg .
&quot; Mother says I may when I &apos;m eighteen , perhaps ; but two years is an everlasting time to wait . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure our <unk> look like silk , and they are nice enough for us .
Yours is as good as new , but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine .
Whatever shall I do ?
the burn shows badly , and I can &apos;t take any out . &quot;
&quot; You must sit still all you can , and keep your back out of sight ; the front is all right .
I shall have a new ribbon for my hair , and Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin , and my new slippers are lovely , and my gloves will do , though they aren &apos;t as nice as I &apos;d like . &quot;
&quot; Mine are spoilt with lemonade , and I can &apos;t get any new ones , so I shall have to go without , &quot; said Jo , who never troubled herself much about dress .
&quot; You _ must _ have gloves , or I won &apos;t go , &quot; cried Meg decidedly .
&quot; <unk> are more important than anything else ; you can &apos;t dance without them , and if you don &apos;t I should be _ so _ <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Then I &apos;ll stay still .
I don &apos;t care much for company dancing ; it &apos;s no fun to go <unk> round ; I like to fly about and cut <unk> . &quot;
&quot; You can &apos;t ask mother for new ones , they are so <unk> , and you are so careless .
She said , when you spoilt the others , that she shouldn &apos;t get you any more this winter .
Can &apos;t you make them do ? &quot;
asked Meg anxiously .
&quot; I can hold them crumpled up in my hand , so no one will know how stained they are ; that &apos;s all I can do .
No !
I &apos;ll tell you how we can <unk> wear one good one and carry a bad one ; don &apos;t you see ? &quot;
&quot; Your hands are bigger than mine , and you will stretch my glove dreadfully , &quot; began Meg , whose gloves were a tender point with her .
&quot; Then I &apos;ll go without .
I don &apos;t care what people say ! &quot;
cried Jo , taking up her book .
&quot; You may have it , you may !
only don &apos;t <unk> it , and do behave nicely .
Don &apos;t put your hands behind you , or stare , or say &apos; Christopher Columbus ! &apos;
will you ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t worry about me ; I &apos;ll be as prim as I can , and not get into any scrapes , if I can help it .
Now go and answer your note , and let me finish this splendid story . &quot;
So Meg went away to &quot; accept with thanks , &quot; look over her dress , and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace <unk> ; while Jo finished her story , her four apples , and had a game of <unk> with Scrabble .
On New-Year &apos;s Eve the parlor was deserted , for the two younger girls played <unk> , and the two elder were absorbed in the <unk> business of &quot; getting ready for the party . &quot;
Simple as the <unk> were , there was a great deal of running up and down , laughing and talking , and at one time a strong smell of burnt hair pervaded the house .
Meg wanted a few curls about her face , and Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs .
&#91; Illustration : Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks &#93; &quot; <unk> they to smoke like that ? &quot;
asked Beth , from her perch on the bed .
&quot; It &apos;s the <unk> drying , &quot; replied Jo .
&quot; What a queer smell !
it &apos;s like burnt feathers , &quot; observed Amy , smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air .
&quot; There , now I &apos;ll take off the papers and you &apos;ll see a cloud of little <unk> , &quot; said Jo , putting down the tongs .
She did take off the papers , but no cloud of <unk> appeared , for the hair came with the papers , and the horrified <unk> laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim .
&quot; Oh , oh , oh !
what _ have _ you done ?
I &apos;m spoilt !
I can &apos;t go !
My hair , oh , my hair ! &quot;
<unk> Meg , looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead .
&quot; Just my <unk> !
you shouldn &apos;t have asked me to do it ; I always spoil everything .
I &apos;m so sorry , but the tongs were too hot , and so I &apos;ve made a mess , &quot; groaned poor Jo , regarding the black <unk> with tears of regret .
&quot; It isn &apos;t spoilt ; just frizzle it , and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit , and it will look like the last fashion .
I &apos;ve seen many girls do it so , &quot; said Amy consolingly .
&quot; <unk> me right for trying to be fine .
I wish I &apos;d let my hair alone , &quot; cried Meg petulantly .
&quot; So do I , it was so smooth and pretty .
But it will soon grow out again , &quot; said Beth , coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep .
After various <unk> <unk> , Meg was finished at last , and by the <unk> exertions of the family Jo &apos;s hair was got up and her dress on .
They looked very well in their simple suits , <unk> in silvery <unk> , with a blue velvet <unk> , lace <unk> , and the pearl pin ; Jo in <unk> , with a stiff , gentlemanly linen collar , and a white <unk> or two for her only ornament .
Each put on one nice light glove , and carried one <unk> one , and all pronounced the effect &quot; quite easy and fine . &quot;
Meg &apos;s high-heeled slippers were very tight , and hurt her , though she would not own it , and Jo &apos;s nineteen hair-pins all seemed stuck straight into her head , which was not exactly comfortable ; but , dear me , let us be elegant or die !
&quot; Have a good time , <unk> ! &quot;
said Mrs. March , as the sisters went <unk> down the walk .
&quot; Don &apos;t eat much supper , and come away at eleven , when I send Hannah for you . &quot;
As the gate clashed behind them , a voice cried from a window , -- &quot; Girls , girls !
_ have _ you both got nice <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , yes , <unk> nice , and Meg has cologne on hers , &quot; cried Jo , adding , with a laugh , as they went on , &quot; I do believe Marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake . &quot;
&quot; It is one of her aristocratic tastes , and quite proper , for a real lady is always known by neat boots , gloves , and handkerchief , &quot; replied Meg , who had a good many little &quot; aristocratic tastes &quot; of her own .
&quot; Now don &apos;t forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight , Jo .
Is my sash right ?
and does my hair look _ very _ bad ? &quot;
said Meg , as she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner &apos;s <unk> , after a <unk> prink .
&quot; I know I shall forget .
If you see me doing anything wrong , just remind me by a <unk> , will you ? &quot;
returned Jo , giving her collar a <unk> and her head a hasty <unk> .
&quot; No , winking isn &apos;t <unk> ; I &apos;ll lift my eyebrows if anything is wrong , and nod if you are all right .
Now hold your shoulders straight , and take short steps , and don &apos;t shake hands if you are introduced to any one : it isn &apos;t the thing . &quot;
&quot; How _ do _ you learn all the proper ways ?
I never can .
Isn &apos;t that music gay ? &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Mrs. Gardiner greeted them &#93; Down they went , feeling a trifle timid , for they seldom went to parties , and , <unk> as this little gathering was , it was an event to them .
Mrs. Gardiner , a stately old lady , greeted them kindly , and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters .
Meg knew Sallie , and was at her ease very soon ; but Jo , who didn &apos;t care much for girls or girlish gossip , stood about , with her back carefully against the wall , and felt as much out of place as a colt in a <unk> .
Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room , and she longed to go and join them , for skating was one of the joys of her life .
She telegraphed her wish to Meg , but the eyebrows went up so <unk> that she dared not stir .
No one came to talk to her , and one by one the group near her <unk> away , till she was left alone .
She could not <unk> about and amuse herself , for the burnt breadth would show , so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began .
Meg was asked at once , and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their <unk> suffered <unk> .
Jo saw a big red-headed youth approaching her corner , and fearing he meant to <unk> her , she slipped into a curtained recess , intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace .
Unfortunately , another bashful person had chosen the same refuge ; for , as the curtain fell behind her , she found herself face to face with the &quot; Laurence boy . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : <unk> to face with the Laurence boy &#93; &quot; Dear me , I didn &apos;t know any one was here ! &quot;
stammered Jo , preparing to back out as <unk> as she had bounced in .
But the boy laughed , and said pleasantly , though he looked a little startled , -- &quot; Don &apos;t mind me ; stay , if you like . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;n&apos;t I disturb you ? &quot;
&quot; Not a bit ; I only came here because I don &apos;t know many people , and felt rather strange at first , you know . &quot;
&quot; So did I.
Don &apos;t go away , please , unless you &apos;d rather . &quot;
The boy sat down again and looked at his <unk> , till Jo said , trying to be polite and easy , -- &quot; I think I &apos;ve had the pleasure of seeing you before ; you live near us , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Next door &quot; ; and he looked up and laughed outright , for Jo &apos;s prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home .
That put Jo at her ease ; and she laughed too , as she said , in her <unk> way , -- &quot; We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present . &quot;
&quot; Grandpa sent it . &quot;
&quot; But you put it into his head , didn &apos;t you , now ? &quot;
&quot; How is your cat , Miss March ? &quot;
asked the boy , trying to look sober , while his black eyes shone with fun .
&quot; <unk> , thank you , Mr. Laurence ; but I am not Miss March , I &apos;m only Jo , &quot; returned the young lady .
&quot; I &apos;m not Mr. Laurence , I &apos;m only Laurie . &quot;
&quot; Laurie Laurence , <unk> an odd name ! &quot;
&quot; My first name is Theodore , but I don &apos;t like it , for the fellows called me <unk> , so I made them say Laurie instead . &quot;
&quot; I hate my name , <unk> sentimental !
I wish every one would say Jo , instead of Josephine .
How did you make the boys stop calling you <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; I <unk> &apos; em . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t <unk> Aunt March , so I suppose I shall have to bear it &quot; ; and Jo resigned herself with a sigh .
&quot; Don &apos;t you like to dance , Miss Jo ? &quot;
asked Laurie , looking as if he thought the name suited her .
&quot; I like it well enough if there is plenty of room , and every one is lively .
In a place like this I &apos;m sure to upset something , tread on people &apos;s toes , or do something dreadful , so I keep out of mischief , and let Meg sail about .
Don &apos;t you dance ? &quot;
&quot; Sometimes ; you see I &apos;ve been abroad a good many years , and haven &apos;t been into company enough yet to know how you do things here . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
cried Jo .
&quot; Oh , tell me about it !
I love dearly to hear people describe their travels . &quot;
Laurie didn &apos;t seem to know where to begin ; but Jo &apos;s eager questions soon set him going , and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay , where the boys never wore hats , and had a <unk> of boats on the lake , and for holiday fun went walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers .
&quot; Don &apos;t I wish I &apos;d been there ! &quot;
cried Jo .
&quot; Did you go to Paris ? &quot;
&quot; We spent last winter there . &quot;
&quot; Can you talk French ? &quot;
&quot; We were not allowed to speak any thing else at Vevay . &quot;
&quot; Do say some !
I can read it , but can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> en <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
said Laurie good-naturedly .
&quot; How nicely you do it !
Let me see , <unk> said , &apos; Who is the young lady in the pretty slippers , &apos; didn &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , mademoiselle . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s my sister Margaret , and you knew it was !
Do you think she is pretty ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; she makes me think of the German girls , she looks so fresh and quiet , and dances like a lady . &quot;
Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister , and stored it up to repeat to Meg .
Both peeped and criticised and chatted , till they felt like old acquaintances .
Laurie &apos;s bashfulness soon wore off ; for Jo &apos;s gentlemanly <unk> amused and set him at his ease , and Jo was her merry self again , because her dress was forgotten , and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her .
She liked the &quot; Laurence boy &quot; better than ever , and took several good looks at him , so that she might describe him to the girls ; for they had no brothers , very few <unk> cousins , and boys were almost unknown creatures to them .
&quot; <unk> black hair ; brown skin ; big , black eyes ; handsome nose ; fine teeth ; small hands and feet ; <unk> than I am ; very polite , for a boy , and altogether jolly .
<unk> how old he is ? &quot;
It was on the <unk> of Jo &apos;s tongue to ask ; but she checked herself in time , and , with unusual tact , tried to find out in a <unk> way .
&quot; I suppose you are going to college soon ?
I see you <unk> away at your books , <unk> , I mean studying hard &quot; ; and Jo blushed at the dreadful &quot; <unk> &quot; which had escaped her .
Laurie smiled , but didn &apos;t seem <unk> , and answered , with a shrug , -- &quot; Not for a year or two ; I won &apos;t go before seventeen , <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Aren &apos;t you but fifteen ? &quot;
asked Jo , looking at the tall lad , whom she had imagined seventeen already .
&quot; <unk> , next month . &quot;
&quot; How I wish I was going to college !
You don &apos;t look as if you liked it . &quot;
&quot; I hate it !
Nothing but <unk> or <unk> .
And I don &apos;t like the way fellows do either , in this country . &quot;
&quot; What do you like ? &quot;
&quot; To live in Italy , and to enjoy myself in my own way . &quot;
Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was ; but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them ; so she changed the subject by saying , as her foot kept time , &quot; That &apos;s a splendid <unk> !
Why don &apos;t you go and try it ? &quot;
&quot; If you will come too , &quot; he answered , with a gallant little bow .
&quot; I can &apos;t ; for I told Meg I wouldn &apos;t , <unk> &quot; There Jo stopped , and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh .
&quot; Because what ? &quot;
asked Laurie curiously .
&quot; You won &apos;t tell ? &quot;
&quot; Never ! &quot;
&quot; Well , I have a bad <unk> of standing before the fire , and so I burn my <unk> , and I scorched this one ; and , though it &apos;s nicely mended , it shows , and Meg told me to keep still , so no one would see it .
You may laugh , if you want to ; it is funny , I know . &quot;
But Laurie didn &apos;t laugh ; he only looked down a minute , and the expression of his face puzzled Jo , when he said very gently , -- &quot; Never mind that ; I &apos;ll tell you how we can manage : there &apos;s a long hall out there , and we can dance <unk> , and no one will see us .
Please come ? &quot;
Jo thanked him , and gladly went , wishing she had two neat gloves , when she saw the nice , <unk> ones her partner wore .
The hall was empty , and they had a grand <unk> ; for Laurie danced well , and taught her the German step , which delighted Jo , being full of swing and spring .
When the music stopped , they sat down on the stairs to get their breath ; and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students &apos; festival at <unk> , when Meg appeared in search of her sister .
She beckoned , and Jo reluctantly followed her into a <unk> , where she found her on a sofa , holding her foot , and looking pale .
&#91; Illustration : They sat down on the stairs &#93; &quot; I &apos;ve <unk> my ankle .
That stupid high heel turned , and gave me a sad <unk> .
It aches so , I can hardly stand , and I don &apos;t know how I &apos;m ever going to get home , &quot; she said , rocking to and fro in pain .
&quot; I knew you &apos;d hurt your feet with those silly shoes .
I &apos;m sorry .
But I don &apos;t see what you can do , except get a carriage , or stay here all night , &quot; answered Jo , softly <unk> the poor ankle as she spoke .
&quot; I can &apos;t have a carriage , without its <unk> ever so much .
I dare say I can &apos;t get one at all ; for most people come in their own , and it &apos;s a long way to the <unk> , and no one to send . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll go . &quot;
&quot; No , indeed !
It &apos;s past nine , and dark as <unk> .
I can &apos;t stop here , for the house is full .
Sallie has some girls <unk> with her .
I &apos;ll rest till Hannah comes , and then do the best I can . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll ask Laurie ; he will go , &quot; said Jo , looking relieved as the idea occurred to her .
&quot; Mercy , no !
Don &apos;t ask or tell any one .
Get me my rubbers , and put these slippers with our things .
I can &apos;t dance any more ; but as soon as supper is over , watch for Hannah , and tell me the minute she comes . &quot;
&quot; They are going out to supper now .
I &apos;ll stay with you ; I &apos;d rather . &quot;
&quot; No , dear , run along , and bring me some coffee .
I &apos;m so tired , I can &apos;t stir ! &quot;
So Meg <unk> , with rubbers well hidden , and Jo went <unk> away to the dining-room , which she found after going into a china-closet , and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little private refreshment .
<unk> a <unk> at the table , she <unk> the coffee , which she immediately <unk> , <unk> making the front of her dress as bad as the back .
&quot; Oh , dear , what a <unk> I am ! &quot;
exclaimed Jo , finishing Meg &apos;s glove by <unk> her gown with it .
&quot; Can I help you ? &quot;
said a friendly voice ; and there was Laurie , with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other .
&quot; I was trying to get something for Meg , who is very tired , and some one shook me ; and here I am , in a nice state , &quot; answered Jo , glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the <unk> glove .
&quot; Too bad !
I was looking for some one to give this to .
May I take it to your sister ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , thank you !
I &apos;ll show you where she is .
I don &apos;t offer to take it myself , for I should only get into another scrape if I did . &quot;
Jo led the way ; and , as if used to waiting on ladies , Laurie drew up a little table , brought a second <unk> of coffee and ice for Jo , and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a &quot; nice boy . &quot;
They had a merry time over the bonbons and <unk> , and were in the midst of a quiet game of &quot; <unk> , &quot; with two or three other young people who had strayed in , when Hannah appeared .
Meg forgot her foot , and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo , with an exclamation of pain .
&quot; Hush !
Don &apos;t say anything , &quot; she whispered , adding aloud , &quot; It &apos;s nothing .
I turned my foot a little , that &apos;s all &quot; ; and <unk> <unk> to put her things on .
Hannah scolded , Meg cried , and Jo was at her wits &apos; end , till she decided to take things into her own hands .
<unk> out , she ran down , and , finding a servant , asked if he could get her a carriage .
It happened to be a <unk> <unk> , who knew nothing about the neighborhood ; and Jo was looking round for help , when Laurie , who had heard what she said , came up , and offered his grandfather &apos;s carriage , which had just come for him , he said .
&quot; It &apos;s so early !
You can &apos;t mean to go yet ? &quot;
began Jo , looking relieved , but <unk> to accept the offer .
&quot; I always go early , --I do , truly !
Please let me take you home ?
It &apos;s all on my way , you know , and it <unk> , they say . &quot;
That settled it ; and , telling him of Meg &apos;s mishap , Jo gratefully accepted , and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party .
Hannah hated rain as much as a cat does ; so she made no trouble , and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage , feeling very festive and elegant .
Laurie went on the box ; so Meg could keep her foot up , and the girls talked over their party in freedom .
&quot; I had a capital time .
Did you ? &quot;
asked Jo , rumpling up her hair , and making herself comfortable .
&quot; Yes , till I hurt myself .
Sallie &apos;s friend , Annie Moffat , took a fancy to me , and asked me to come and spend a week with her , when Sallie does .
She is going in the spring , when the opera comes ; and it will be perfectly splendid , if mother only lets me go , &quot; answered Meg , cheering up at the thought .
&quot; I saw you dancing with the red-headed man I ran away from .
Was he nice ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , very !
His hair is <unk> , not red ; and he was very polite , and I had a delicious <unk> with him . &quot;
&quot; He looked like a <unk> in a fit , when he did the new step .
Laurie and I couldn &apos;t help laughing .
Did you hear us ? &quot;
&quot; No ; but it was very rude .
What _ were _ you about all that time , hidden away there ? &quot;
Jo told her adventures , and , by the time she had finished , they were at home .
With many thanks , they said &quot; Good night , &quot; and crept in , hoping to disturb no one ; but the instant their door <unk> , two little <unk> <unk> up , and two sleepy but eager voices cried out , -- &quot; Tell about the party !
tell about the party ! &quot;
With what Meg called &quot; a great want of manners , &quot; Jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls ; and they soon subsided , after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening .
&quot; I declare , it really seems like being a fine young lady , to come home from the party in a carriage , and sit in my dressing-gown , with a maid to wait on me , &quot; said Meg , as Jo bound up her foot with <unk> , and brushed her hair .
&quot; I don &apos;t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do , in spite of our burnt hair , old gowns , one glove apiece , and tight slippers that <unk> our <unk> when we are silly enough to wear them . &quot;
And I think Jo was quite right .
&#91; Illustration : Tell about the party &#93; &#91; Illustration : The kitten stuck like a burr just out of reach &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
&quot; Oh dear , how hard it does seem to take up our <unk> and go on , &quot; sighed Meg , the morning after the party ; for , now the <unk> were over , the week of <unk> did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked .
&quot; I wish it was Christmas or New-Year all the time ; wouldn &apos;t it be fun ? &quot;
answered Jo , <unk> dismally .
&quot; We shouldn &apos;t enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now .
But it does seem so nice to have little <unk> and bouquets , and go to parties , and drive home , and read and rest , and not work .
It &apos;s like other people , you know , and I always envy girls who do such things ; I &apos;m so fond of luxury , &quot; said Meg , trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby .
&quot; Well , we can &apos;t have it , so don &apos;t let us <unk> , but shoulder our bundles and <unk> along as cheerfully as Marmee does .
I &apos;m sure Aunt March is a regular Old <unk> of the <unk> to me , but I suppose when I &apos;ve learned to carry her without complaining , she will tumble off , or get so light that I sha &apos;n&apos;t mind her . &quot;
This idea <unk> Jo &apos;s fancy , and put her in good spirits ; but Meg didn &apos;t brighten , for her burden , <unk> of four spoilt children , seemed <unk> than ever .
She hadn &apos;t heart enough even to make herself pretty , as usual , by putting on a blue <unk> , and dressing her hair in the most becoming way .
&quot; Where &apos;s the use of looking nice , when no one sees me but those cross <unk> , and no one cares whether I &apos;m pretty or not ? &quot;
she muttered , shutting her drawer with a <unk> .
&quot; I shall have to <unk> and <unk> all my days , with only little bits of fun now and then , and get old and ugly and sour , because I &apos;m poor , and can &apos;t enjoy my life as other girls do .
It &apos;s a shame ! &quot;
So Meg went down , wearing an injured look , and wasn &apos;t at all agreeable at <unk> .
Every one seemed rather out of sorts , and inclined to croak .
Beth had a headache , and lay on the sofa , trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens ; Amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned , and she couldn &apos;t find her rubbers ; Jo _ would _ whistle and make a great racket getting ready ; Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter , which must go at once ; and Hannah had the <unk> , for being up late didn &apos;t suit her .
&quot; There never _ was _ such a cross family ! &quot;
cried Jo , losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand , broken both <unk> , and sat down upon her hat .
&quot; You &apos;re the <unk> person in it ! &quot;
returned Amy , washing out the sum , that was all wrong , with the tears that had fallen on her slate .
&quot; Beth , if you don &apos;t keep these horrid cats down cellar I &apos;ll have them <unk> , &quot; exclaimed Meg angrily , as she tried to get <unk> of the kitten , which had scrambled up her back , and stuck like a burr just out of reach .
Jo laughed , Meg scolded , Beth implored , and Amy <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t remember how much nine times twelve was .
&quot; Girls , girls , do be quiet one minute !
I _ must _ get this off by the early mail , and you drive me distracted with your worry , &quot; cried Mrs. March , <unk> out the third spoilt sentence in her letter .
There was a momentary lull , broken by Hannah , who stalked in , laid two hot turn-overs on the table , and stalked out again .
These turn-overs were an institution ; and the girls called them &quot; <unk> , &quot; for they had no others , and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold <unk> .
Hannah never forgot to make them , no matter how busy or <unk> she might be , for the walk was long and <unk> ; the poor things got no other lunch , and were seldom home before two .
&quot; <unk> your cats , and get over your headache , Bethy .
Good-by , Marmee ; we are a set of rascals this morning , but we &apos;ll come home regular angels .
Now then , Meg ! &quot;
and Jo tramped away , feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do .
They always looked back before turning the corner , for their mother was always at the window , to nod and smile , and wave her hand to them .
Somehow it seemed as if they couldn &apos;t have got through the day without that ; for , whatever their mood might be , the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine .
&quot; If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us , it would serve us right , for more ungrateful <unk> than we are were never seen , &quot; cried Jo , taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind .
&quot; Don &apos;t use such dreadful <unk> , &quot; said Meg , from the <unk> of the <unk> in which she had <unk> herself like a <unk> sick of the world .
&quot; I like good strong words , that mean something , &quot; replied Jo , catching her hat as it took a leap off her head , <unk> to flying away altogether .
&quot; <unk> yourself any names you like ; but _ I _ am neither a <unk> nor a wretch , and I don &apos;t choose to be called so . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re a blighted being , and decidedly cross to-day because you can &apos;t sit in the lap of luxury all the time .
Poor dear , just wait till I make my fortune , and you shall revel in carriages and ice-cream and high-heeled slippers and <unk> and red-headed boys to dance with . &quot;
&quot; How ridiculous you are , Jo ! &quot;
but Meg laughed at the nonsense , and felt better in spite of herself .
&quot; <unk> for you I am ; for if I put on crushed airs , and tried to be dismal , as you do , we should be in a nice state .
Thank goodness , I can always find something funny to keep me up .
Don &apos;t croak any more , but come home jolly , there &apos;s a dear . &quot;
Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day , each going a different way , each hugging her little warm <unk> , and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather , hard work , and the <unk> desires of <unk> youth .
When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend , the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support , at least .
<unk> that they could not begin too early to <unk> energy , <unk> , and independence , their parents consented , and both fell to work with the hearty good-will which in spite of all obstacles , is sure to succeed at last .
Margaret found a place as nursery governess , and felt rich with her small salary .
As she said , she _ was _ &quot; fond of luxury , &quot; and her chief trouble was poverty .
She found it harder to bear than the others , because she could remember a time when home was beautiful , life full of ease and pleasure , and want of any kind unknown .
She tried not to be <unk> or discontented , but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things , gay friends , accomplishments , and a happy life .
At the Kings &apos; she daily saw all she wanted , for the children &apos;s older sisters were just out , and Meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty <unk> and bouquets , heard lively gossip about theatres , concerts , <unk> parties , and <unk> of all kinds , and saw money <unk> on trifles which would have been so precious to her .
Poor Meg seldom complained , but a sense of <unk> made her feel bitter toward every one sometimes , for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy .
Jo happened to suit Aunt March , who was lame , and needed an active person to wait upon her .
The <unk> old lady had offered to <unk> one of the girls when the troubles came , and was much offended because her offer was declined .
Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady &apos;s will ; but the unworldly Marches only said , -- &quot; We can &apos;t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes .
Rich or poor , we will keep together and be happy in one another . &quot;
The old lady wouldn &apos;t speak to them for a time , but <unk> to meet Jo at a friend &apos;s , something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady &apos;s fancy , and she proposed to take her for a companion .
This did not suit Jo at all ; but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared , and , to every one &apos;s surprise , got on remarkably well with her irascible <unk> .
There was an occasional <unk> , and once Jo had marched home , declaring she couldn &apos;t bear it any longer ; but Aunt March always cleared up quickly , and sent for her back again with such <unk> that she could not refuse , for in her heart she rather liked the <unk> old lady .
I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books , which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died .
Jo remembered the kind old gentleman , who used to let her <unk> <unk> and <unk> with his big <unk> , tell her stories about the queer pictures in his Latin books , and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street .
The dim , dusty room , with the busts staring down from the tall <unk> , the cosy chairs , the <unk> , and , best of all , the wilderness of books , in which she could <unk> where she liked , made the library a <unk> of bliss to her .
The moment Aunt March took her nap , or was busy with company , Jo hurried to this quiet place , and , <unk> herself up in the easy-chair , <unk> poetry , romance , history , travels , and pictures , like a regular <unk> .
But , like all happiness , it did not last long ; for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story , the sweetest verse of the song , or the most perilous <unk> of her traveller , a <unk> voice called , &quot; Josy-phine !
Josy-phine ! &quot;
and she had to leave her paradise to wind <unk> , wash the poodle , or read Belsham &apos;s <unk> by the hour together .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> herself up in the big chair &#93; Jo &apos;s ambition was to do something very splendid ; what it was she had no idea , as yet , but left it for time to tell her ; and , meanwhile , found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn &apos;t read , run , and ride as much as she liked .
A quick temper , sharp tongue , and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes , and her life was a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which were both <unk> and pathetic .
But the training she received at Aunt March &apos;s was just what she needed ; and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy , in spite of the perpetual &quot; Josy-phine ! &quot;
