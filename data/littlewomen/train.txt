The color <unk> in Jo &apos;s cheeks , as she answered , with the look of mingled pleasure , pride , and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers , -- &quot; I &apos;m afraid it is so , mother ; he hasn &apos;t said anything , but he looks a great deal .
I think I had better go away before it comes to anything . &quot;
&quot; I agree with you , and if it can be managed you shall go . &quot;
Jo looked relieved , and , after a pause , said , smiling , &quot; How Mrs. Moffat would wonder at your want of management , if she knew ; and how she will <unk> that Annie still may hope . &quot;
&quot; Ah , Jo , mothers may <unk> in their management , but the hope is the same in all , --the desire to see their children happy .
Meg is so , and I am content with her success .
You I leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it ; for only then will you find that there is something sweeter .
Amy is my chief care now , but her good sense will help her .
For Beth , I indulge no hopes except that she may be well .
By the way , she seems <unk> this last day or two .
Have you spoken to her ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; she <unk> she had a trouble , and promised to tell me by and by .
I said no more , for I think I know it ; &quot; and Jo told her little story .
Mrs. March shook her head , and did not take so romantic a view of the case , but looked grave , and repeated her opinion that , for Laurie &apos;s sake , Jo should go away for a time .
&quot; Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled ; then I &apos;ll run away before he can <unk> his wits and be tragical .
Beth must think I &apos;m going to please myself , as I am , for I can &apos;t talk about Laurie to her ; but she can pet and comfort him after I &apos;m gone , and so cure him of this romantic notion .
He &apos;s been through so many little trials of the sort , he &apos;s used to it , and will soon get over his love-lornity . &quot;
Jo spoke hopefully , but could not <unk> herself of the <unk> fear that this &quot; little trial &quot; would be harder than the others , and that Laurie would not get over his &quot; love-lornity &quot; as easily as <unk> .
The plan was talked over in a family <unk> , and agreed upon ; for Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo , and promised to make a pleasant home for her .
The teaching would render her independent ; and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing , while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable .
Jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone , for the <unk> was growing too narrow for her restless nature and <unk> spirit .
When all was settled , with fear and trembling she told Laurie ; but to her surprise he took it very quietly .
He had been <unk> than usual of late , but very pleasant ; and , when <unk> accused of turning over a new leaf , he answered soberly , &quot; So I am ; and I mean this one shall stay turned . &quot;
Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then , and made her preparations with a <unk> heart , --for Beth seemed more cheerful , --and hoped she was doing the best for all .
&quot; One thing I leave to your especial care , &quot; she said , the night before she left .
&quot; You mean your papers ? &quot;
asked Beth .
&quot; No , my boy .
Be very good to him , won &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Of course I will ; but I can &apos;t fill your place , and he &apos;ll miss you sadly . &quot;
&quot; It won &apos;t hurt him ; so remember , I leave him in your charge , to plague , pet , and keep in order . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll do my best , for your sake , &quot; promised Beth , wondering why Jo looked at her so <unk> .
When Laurie said &quot; Good-by , &quot; he whispered <unk> , &quot; It won &apos;t do a bit of good , Jo .
My eye is on you ; so mind what you do , or I &apos;ll come and bring you home . &quot;

JO &apos;S <unk> .
&quot; NEW <unk> , November .
&quot; DEAR <unk> AND BETH , -- &quot; I &apos;m going to write you a regular volume , for I &apos;ve got heaps to tell , though I &apos;m not a fine young lady travelling on the <unk> .
When I lost sight of father &apos;s dear old face , I felt a trifle blue , and might have shed a <unk> drop or two , if an Irish lady with four small children , all crying more or less , hadn &apos;t diverted my mind ; for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to <unk> .
&quot; Soon the sun came out , and taking it as a good omen , I cleared up likewise , and enjoyed my journey with all my heart .
&quot; Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once , even in that big house full of strangers .
She gave me a funny little <unk> she had ; but there is a stove in it , and a nice table in a sunny window , so I can sit here and write whenever I like .
A fine view and a <unk> opposite atone for the many stairs , and I took a fancy to my den on the spot .
The nursery , where I am to teach and sew , is a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke &apos;s private parlor , and the two little girls are pretty children , --rather spoilt , I fancy , but they took to me after telling them &apos; The Seven <unk> <unk> ; &apos; and I &apos;ve no doubt I shall make a model governess .
&quot; I am to have my meals with the children , if I prefer it to the great table , and for the present I do , for I _ am _ bashful , though no one will believe it .
&quot; &apos; Now , my dear , make yourself at home , &apos; said Mrs. K. in her motherly way ; &apos; I &apos;m on the drive from morning to night , as you may suppose with such a family ; but a great anxiety will be off my mind if I know the children are safe with you .
My rooms are always open to you , and your own shall be as comfortable as I can make it .
There are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable , and your evenings are always free .
Come to me if anything goes wrong , and be as happy as you can .
There &apos;s the tea-bell ; I must run and change my cap ; &apos; and off she <unk> , leaving me to settle myself in my new nest .
&quot; As I went downstairs , soon after , I saw something I liked .
The <unk> are very long in this tall house , and as I stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to <unk> up , I saw a gentleman come along behind her , take the heavy <unk> of <unk> out of her hand , carry it all the way up , put it down at a door near by , and walk away , saying , with a kind nod and a foreign accent , -- &quot; &apos; It goes better so .
The little back is too young to haf such <unk> . &apos;
&quot; Wasn &apos;t it good of him ?
I like such things , for , as father says , trifles show character .
When I mentioned it to Mrs. K. , that evening , she laughed , and said , -- &quot; &apos; That must have been Professor Bhaer ; he &apos;s always doing things of that sort . &apos;
&quot; Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin ; very learned and good , but poor as a <unk> , and gives lessons to support himself and two little <unk> <unk> whom he is <unk> here , according to the wishes of his sister , who married an American .
Not a very romantic story , but it interested me ; and I was glad to hear that Mrs. K. <unk> him her parlor for some of his <unk> .
There is a glass door between it and the nursery , and I mean to peep at him , and then I &apos;ll tell you how he looks .
He &apos;s almost forty , so it &apos;s no harm , Marmee .
&quot; After tea and a <unk> <unk> with the little girls , I <unk> the big work-basket , and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend .
I shall keep a <unk> , and send it once a week ; so good-night , and more to-morrow . &quot;
&quot; _ Tuesday Eve . _ &quot; <unk> a lively time in my <unk> , this morning , for the children acted like Sancho ; and at one time I really thought I should shake them all round .
Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics , and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still .
After luncheon , the girl took them out for a walk , and I went to my needle-work , like little <unk> , &apos; with a willing mind . &apos;
I was <unk> my stars that I &apos;d learned to make nice button-holes , when the <unk> opened and shut , and some one began to hum , -- &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> land , &apos; like a big <unk> .
It was dreadfully improper , I know , but I couldn &apos;t resist the temptation ; and <unk> one end of the curtain before the glass door , I peeped in .
Professor Bhaer was there ; and while he arranged his books , I took a good look at him .
A regular German , --rather stout , with brown hair tumbled all over his head , a bushy beard , good nose , the kindest eyes I ever saw , and a splendid big voice that does one &apos;s ears good , after our sharp or <unk> American <unk> .
His clothes were <unk> , his hands were large , and he hadn &apos;t a really handsome feature in his face , except his beautiful teeth ; yet I liked him , for he had a fine head ; his linen was very nice , and he looked like a gentleman , though two buttons were off his coat , and there was a <unk> on one shoe .
He looked sober in spite of his humming , till he went to the window to turn the <unk> <unk> toward the sun , and stroke the cat , who received him like an old friend .
Then he smiled ; and when a tap came at the door , called out in a loud , brisk tone , -- &quot; &apos; <unk> ! &apos;
&quot; I was just going to run , when I caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book , and stopped to see what was going on .
&quot; &apos; Me wants my Bhaer , &apos; said the mite , slamming down her book , and running to meet him .
&quot; &apos; Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer ; come , then , and take a <unk> hug from him , my Tina , &apos; said the Professor , catching her up , with a laugh , and holding her so high over his head that she had to <unk> her little face to kiss him .
&#91; Illustration : Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer &#93; &quot; &apos; Now me <unk> <unk> my <unk> , &apos; went on the funny little thing ; so he put her up at the table , opened the great <unk> she had brought , and gave her a paper and pencil , and she scribbled away , turning a leaf now and then , and passing her little fat finger down the page , as if finding a word , so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh , while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair , with a fatherly look , that made me think she must be his own , though she looked more French than German .
&quot; Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work , and there I <unk> remained through all the <unk> and <unk> that went on next door .
One of the girls kept laughing <unk> , and saying &apos; Now Professor , &apos; in a coquettish tone , and the other pronounced her German with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober .
&quot; Both seemed to try his patience sorely ; for more than once I heard him say <unk> , &apos; No , no , it is _ not _ so ; you haf not attend to what I say ; &apos; and once there was a loud rap , as if he struck the table with his book , followed by the despairing exclamation , &apos; Prut !
it all goes bad this day . &apos;
&quot; Poor man , I pitied him ; and when the girls were gone , took just one more peep , to see if he <unk> it .
He seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair , tired out , and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two , when he jumped up , put his books in his pocket , as if ready for another lesson , and , taking little Tina , who had fallen asleep on the sofa , in his arms , he carried her quietly away .
I fancy he has a hard life of it .
&quot; Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn &apos;t go down to the five o &apos;clock dinner ; and , feeling a little bit homesick , I thought I would , just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me .
So I made myself respectable , and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke ; but as she is short , and I &apos;m tall , my efforts at <unk> were rather a failure .
She gave me a seat by her , and after my face cooled off , I plucked up courage , and looked about me .
The long table was full , and every one <unk> on getting their dinner , --the gentlemen especially , who seemed to be eating on time , for they _ bolted _ in every sense of the word , <unk> as soon as they were done .
There was the usual <unk> of young men absorbed in themselves ; young couples absorbed in each other ; married ladies in their babies , and old gentlemen in politics .
I don &apos;t think I shall care to have much to do with any of them , except one <unk> maiden lady , who looks as if she had something in her .
&quot; <unk> away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor , <unk> answers to the questions of a very inquisitive , deaf old gentleman on one side , and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other .
If Amy had been here , she &apos;d have turned her back on him forever , because , sad to <unk> , he had a great appetite , and <unk> in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified &apos; her ladyship . &apos;
I didn &apos;t mind , for I like &apos; to see folks eat with a relish , &apos; as Hannah says , and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching <unk> all day .
&quot; As I went upstairs after dinner , two of the young men were settling their hats before the <unk> , and I heard one say low to the other , &apos; Who &apos;s the new party ? &apos;
&quot; &apos; <unk> , or something of that sort . &apos;
&quot; &apos; What the deuce is she at our table for ? &apos;
&quot; &apos; Friend of the old lady &apos;s . &apos;
&quot; &apos; <unk> head , but no style . &apos;
&quot; &apos; Not a bit of it .
Give us a light and come on . &apos;
&quot; I felt angry at first , and then I didn &apos;t care , for a governess is as good as a <unk> , and I &apos;ve got sense , if I haven &apos;t style , which is more than some people have , judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who <unk> away , <unk> like bad <unk> .
I hate ordinary people ! &quot;
&quot; _ Thursday . _ &quot; Yesterday was a quiet day , spent in teaching , sewing , and writing in my little room , which is very cosey , with a light and fire .
I picked up a few bits of news , and was introduced to the Professor .
It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine <unk> in the <unk> here .
The little thing has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer , and <unk> him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home , which delights him , as he is very fond of children , though a &apos; <unk> . &apos;
Kitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard him with affection , and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he <unk> , the presents he brings , and the splendid tales he tells .
The young men <unk> him , it seems , call him Old Fritz , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Major , and make all manner of jokes on his name .
But he <unk> it like a boy , Mrs. K. says , and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him , in spite of his foreign ways .
&quot; The maiden lady is a Miss Norton , <unk> , cultivated , and kind .
She spoke to me at dinner to-day ( for I went to table again , it &apos;s such fun to watch people ) , and asked me to come and see her at her room .
She has fine books and pictures , knows interesting persons , and seems friendly ; so I shall make myself agreeable , for I _ do _ want to get into good society , only it isn &apos;t the same sort that Amy likes .
&quot; I was in our parlor last evening , when Mr. Bhaer came in with some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke .
She wasn &apos;t there , but Minnie , who is a little old woman , introduced me very prettily : &apos; This is mamma &apos;s friend , Miss March . &apos;
&quot; &apos; Yes ; and she &apos;s jolly and we like her lots , &apos; added Kitty , who is an _ <unk> <unk> _ .
&quot; We both bowed , and then we laughed , for the prim <unk> and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast .
&quot; &apos; Ah , yes , I hear these naughty ones go to <unk> you , Mees Marsch .
If so again , call at me and I come , &apos; he said , with a threatening frown that delighted the little <unk> .
&quot; I promised I would , and he departed ; but it seems as if I was <unk> to see a good deal of him , for to-day , as I passed his door on my way out , by accident I knocked against it with my umbrella .
It flew open , and there he stood in his dressing gown , with a big blue sock on one hand , and a <unk> in the other ; he didn &apos;t seem at all ashamed of it , for when I explained and hurried on , he waved his hand , sock and all , saying in his loud , cheerful way , -- &#91; Illustration : He waved his hand , sock and all &#93; &quot; &apos; You haf a fine day to make your walk .
_ <unk> voyage , mademoiselle . _ &apos; &quot; I laughed all the way downstairs ; but it was a little pathetic , also , to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes .
The German gentlemen <unk> , I know ; but <unk> <unk> is another thing , and not so pretty . &quot;
&quot; _ Saturday . _ &quot; Nothing has happened to write about , except a call on Miss Norton , who has a room full of lovely things , and who was very charming , for she showed me all her treasures , and asked me if I would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts , as her escort , <unk> I enjoyed them .
She put it as a favor , but I &apos;m sure Mrs. Kirke has told her about us , and she does it out of kindness to me .
I &apos;m as proud as <unk> , but such favors from such people don &apos;t burden me , and I accepted gratefully .
&quot; When I got back to the nursery there was such an <unk> in the parlor that I looked in ; and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his hands and knees , with Tina on his back , Kitty leading him with a <unk> , and Minnie feeding two small boys with <unk> , as they <unk> and <unk> in <unk> built of chairs .
&quot; &apos; We are playing _ <unk> _ , &apos; explained Kitty .
&quot; &apos; Dis is mine effalunt ! &apos;
added Tina , holding on by the Professor &apos;s hair .
&#91; Illustration : Dis is mine effalunt &#93; &quot; &apos; Mamma always <unk> us to do what we like Saturday afternoon , when Franz and Emil come , doesn &apos;t she , Mr.
Bhaer ? &apos;
said Minnie .
&quot; The &apos; effalunt &apos; sat up , looking as much in earnest as any of them , and said soberly to me , -- &quot; &apos; I gif you my <unk> it is so .
If we make too large a <unk> you shall say &quot; Hush ! &quot;
to us , and we go more softly . &apos;
&quot; I promised to do so , but left the door open , and enjoyed the fun as much as they did , --for a more glorious frolic I never <unk> .
They played <unk> and soldiers , danced and sung , and when it began to grow dark they all piled on to the sofa about the Professor , while he told charming fairy stories of the <unk> on the <unk> , and the little &apos; <unk> , &apos; who ride the <unk> as they fall .
I wish Americans were as simple and natural as Germans , don &apos;t you ?
&quot; I &apos;m so fond of writing , I should go spinning on forever if <unk> of <unk> didn &apos;t stop me , for though I &apos;ve used thin paper and written fine , I <unk> to think of the <unk> this long letter will need .
Pray forward Amy &apos;s as soon as you can spare them .
My small news will sound very flat after her <unk> , but you will like them , I know .
Is Teddy studying so hard that he can &apos;t find time to write to his friends ?
Take good care of him for me , Beth , and tell me all about the babies , and give heaps of love to every one .
&quot; From your faithful JO .
&quot; P. S. On reading over my letter it <unk> me as rather <unk> ; but I am always interested in odd people , and I really had nothing else to write about .
Bless you ! &quot;
&quot; <unk> .
&quot; MY <unk> <unk> , -- &quot; As this is to be a <unk> letter , I <unk> it to you , for it may amuse you , and give you some idea of my <unk> on ; for , though quiet , they are rather amusing , for which , oh , be joyful !
After what Amy would call <unk> efforts , in the way of mental and moral <unk> , my young ideas begin to <unk> and my little <unk> to bend as I could wish .
They are not so interesting to me as Tina and the boys , but I do my duty by them , and they are fond of me .
Franz and Emil are jolly little lads , quite after my own heart ; for the mixture of German and American spirit in them <unk> a constant state of <unk> .
Saturday afternoons are riotous times , whether spent in the house or out ; for on pleasant days they all go to walk , like a <unk> , with the Professor and myself to keep order ; and then such fun !
&quot; We are very good friends now , and I &apos;ve begun to take lessons .
I really couldn &apos;t help it , and it all came about in such a droll way that I must tell you .
To begin at the beginning , Mrs. Kirke called to me , one day , as I passed Mr. Bhaer &apos;s room , where she was rummaging .
&quot; &apos; Did you ever see such a den , my dear ?
Just come and help me put these books to rights , for I &apos;ve turned everything upside down , trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago . &apos;
&quot; I went in , and while we worked I looked about me , for it was &apos; a den , &apos; to be sure .
<unk> and papers everywhere ; a broken <unk> , and an old <unk> over the mantel-piece as if done with ; a ragged bird , without any tail , chirped on one <unk> , and a box of white mice adorned the other ; half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts ; dirty little boots stood drying before the fire ; and <unk> of the dearly beloved boys , for whom he makes a slave of himself , were to be seen all over the room .
After a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found , --one over the <unk> , one covered with ink , and a third burnt brown , having been used as a holder .
&quot; &apos; Such a man ! &apos;
laughed good-natured Mrs. K. , as she put the relics in the rag-bag .
&apos;I suppose the others are torn up to <unk> ships , <unk> cut fingers , or make <unk> .
It &apos;s dreadful , but I can &apos;t scold him : he &apos;s so absent-minded and good-natured , he lets those boys ride over him <unk> .
I agreed to do his washing and mending , but he forgets to give out his things and I forget to look them over , so he comes to a sad pass sometimes . &apos;
&quot; &apos; Let me mend them , &apos; said I.
&apos;I don &apos;t mind it , and he needn &apos;t know .
I &apos;d like to , <unk> &apos;s so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books . &apos;
&quot; So I have got his things in order , and knit heels into two pairs of the socks , --for they were <unk> out of shape with his queer <unk> .
Nothing was said , and I hoped he wouldn &apos;t find it out , but one day last week he caught me at it .
<unk> the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that I took a fancy to learn ; for Tina runs in and out , leaving the door open , and I can hear .
I had been sitting near this door , finishing off the last sock , and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar , who is as stupid as I am .
The girl had gone , and I thought he had also , it was so still , and I was busily <unk> over a <unk> , and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way , when a little crow made me look up , and there was Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly , while he made signs to Tina not to betray him .
&quot; &apos; So ! &apos;
he said , as I stopped and stared like a goose , &apos; you peep at me , I peep at you , and that is not bad ; but see , I am not <unk> when I say , haf you a wish for German ? &apos;
&quot; &apos; Yes ; but you are too busy .
I am too stupid to learn , &apos; I blundered out , as red as a <unk> .
&quot; &apos; Prut !
we will make the time , and we fail not to find the sense .
At <unk> I shall gif a little lesson with much <unk> ; for , look you , Mees Marsch , I haf this debt to pay , &apos; and he pointed to my work .
<unk> , they say to one another , these so kind ladies , &quot; he is a stupid old fellow ; he will see not what we do ; he will never <unk> that his <unk> go not in <unk> any more , he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall , and believe that strings make <unk> . &quot;
Ah !
but I haf an eye , and I see much .
I haf a heart , and I feel the thanks for this .
Come , a little lesson then and now , or no more good fairy works for me and mine . &apos;
&quot; Of course I couldn &apos;t say anything after that , and as it really is a splendid opportunity , I made the bargain , and we began .
I took four lessons , and then I stuck fast in a <unk> <unk> .
The Professor was very patient with me , but it must have been torment to him , and now and then he &apos;d look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a <unk> with me whether to laugh or cry .
I tried both ways ; and when it came to a sniff of utter mortification and woe , he just threw the <unk> on to the floor , and marched out of the room .
I felt myself disgraced and deserted forever , but didn &apos;t blame him a particle , and was <unk> my papers together , meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard , when in he came , as brisk and beaming as if I &apos;d covered myself with glory .
&quot; &apos; Now we shall try a new way .
You and I will read these pleasant little <unk> <unk> <unk> together , and dig no more in that dry book , that goes in the corner for making us trouble . &apos;
&quot; He spoke so kindly , and opened <unk> <unk> &apos;s fairy tales so invitingly before me , that I was more ashamed than ever , and went at my lesson in a <unk> style that seemed to amuse him immensely .
I forgot my bashfulness , and <unk> away ( no other word will express it ) with all my might , tumbling over long words , <unk> according to the inspiration of the minute , and doing my very best .
When I finished reading my first page , and stopped for breath , he clapped his hands and cried out , in his hearty way , &apos; <unk> ist <unk> !
Now we go well !
My turn .
I do him in German ; gif me your ear . &apos;
And away he went , <unk> out the words with his strong voice , and a relish which was good to see as well as hear .
Fortunately the story was the &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &apos; which is droll , you know , so I could laugh , --and I did , <unk> I didn &apos;t understand half he read , for I couldn &apos;t help it , he was so earnest , I so excited , and the whole thing so comical .
&quot; After that we got on better , and now I read my lessons pretty well ; for this way of studying suits me , and I can see that the <unk> gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives <unk> in jelly .
I like it very much , and he doesn &apos;t seem tired of it yet , <unk> is very good of him , isn &apos;t it ?
I mean to give him something on Christmas , for I dare not offer money .
Tell me something nice , Marmee .
&quot; I &apos;m glad Laurie seems so happy and busy , that he has given up <unk> , and lets his hair grow .
You see Beth <unk> him better than I did .
I &apos;m not jealous , dear ; do your best , only don &apos;t make a saint of him .
I &apos;m afraid I couldn &apos;t like him without a spice of human <unk> .
<unk> him bits of my letters .
I haven &apos;t time to write much , and that will do just as well .
Thank <unk> Beth <unk> so comfortable . &quot;
&quot; <unk> .
&quot; A Happy New Year to you all , my dearest family , which of course <unk> Mr. L. and a young man by the name of Teddy .
I can &apos;t tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle , for I didn &apos;t get it till night , and had given up hoping .
Your letter came in the morning , but you said nothing about a parcel , meaning it for a surprise ; so I was disappointed , for I &apos;d had a &apos; kind of a feeling &apos; that you wouldn &apos;t forget me .
I felt a little low in my mind , as I sat up in my room , after tea ; and when the big , muddy , <unk> bundle was brought to me , I just hugged it , and pranced .
It was so _ <unk> _ and refreshing , that I sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried , in my usual absurd way .
The things were just what I wanted , and all the better for being made instead of bought .
Beth &apos;s new &apos; <unk> &apos; was capital ; and Hannah &apos;s box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure .
I &apos;ll be sure and wear the nice <unk> you sent , Marmee , and read carefully the books father has marked .
Thank you all , heaps and heaps !
&#91; Illustration : I sat down upon the floor and read and looked and ate &#93; &quot; <unk> of books reminds me that I &apos;m getting rich in that line for , on New Year &apos;s Day , Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare .
It is one he <unk> much , and I &apos;ve often admired it , set up in the place of honor , with his German <unk> , Plato , <unk> , and <unk> ; so you may imagine how I felt when he brought it down , without its cover , and showed me my name in it , &apos; from my friend Friedrich Bhaer . &apos;
&quot; &apos; You say often you wish a library : here I gif you one ; for between these <unk> ( he meant <unk> ) is many books in one .
<unk> him well , and he will help you much ; for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen . &apos;
&quot; I thanked him as well as I could , and talk now about &apos; my library , &apos; as if I had a hundred books .
I never knew how much there was in Shakespeare before ; but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to me .
Now _ don &apos;t _ laugh at his horrid name ; it isn &apos;t pronounced either <unk> or <unk> , as people _ will _ say it , but something between the two , as only Germans can give it .
I &apos;m glad you both like what I tell you about him , and hope you will know him some day .
Mother would admire his warm heart , father his wise head .
I admire both , and feel rich in my new &apos; friend Friedrich Bhaer . &apos;
&quot; Not having much money , or knowing what he &apos;d like , I got several little things , and put them about the room , where he would find them unexpectedly .
They were useful , pretty , or funny , --a new <unk> on his table , a little vase for his flower , <unk> always has one , or a bit of green in a glass , to keep him fresh , he says , --and a holder for his <unk> , so that he needn &apos;t burn up what Amy calls &apos; <unk> . &apos;
I made it like those Beth invented , --a big <unk> with a fat body , and black and yellow wings , worsted <unk> , and <unk> eyes .
It took his fancy immensely , and he put it on his mantel-piece as an article of _ <unk> _ ; so it was rather a failure after all .
Poor as he is , he didn &apos;t forget a servant or a child in the house ; and not a soul here , from the French <unk> to Miss Norton , forgot him .
I was so glad of that .
&quot; They got up a masquerade , and had a gay time New Year &apos;s Eve .
I didn &apos;t mean to go down , having no dress ; but at the last minute , Mrs. Kirke remembered some old <unk> , and Miss Norton lent me lace and feathers ; so I dressed up as Mrs. <unk> , and sailed in with a mask on .
No one knew me , for I <unk> my voice , and no one dreamed of the silent , haughty Miss March ( for they think I am very stiff and cool , most of them ; and so I am to <unk> ) could dance and dress , and burst out into a &apos; nice <unk> of <unk> , like an <unk> on the banks of the <unk> . &apos;
I enjoyed it very much ; and when we <unk> , it was fun to see them stare at me .
I heard one of the young men tell another that he knew I &apos;d been an <unk> ; in fact , he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the <unk> theatres .
Meg will relish that joke .
Mr. Bhaer was <unk> <unk> , and Tina was <unk> , --a perfect little fairy in his arms .
To see them dance was &apos; quite a landscape , &apos; to use a <unk> .
&quot; I had a very happy New Year , after all ; and when I thought it over in my room , I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite of my many failures ; for I &apos;m cheerful all the time now , work with a will , and take more interest in other people than I used to , which is satisfactory .
Bless you all !
Ever your loving JO . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : In the presence of three gentlemen &#93; <unk> .
A <unk> .
Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her , and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread , and made it sweeter for the effort , Jo still found time for literary labors .
The purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl ; but the means she took to <unk> her end were not the best .
She saw that money conferred power : money and power , therefore , she resolved to have ; not to be used for herself alone , but for those whom she loved more than self .
The dream of filling home with comforts , giving Beth everything she wanted , from strawberries in winter to an <unk> in her <unk> ; going abroad herself , and always having _ more _ than enough , so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity , had been for years Jo &apos;s most cherished castle in the air .
The <unk> experience had seemed to open a way which might , after long travelling and much <unk> work lead to this delightful _ ch� � <unk> en <unk> _ .
But the novel <unk> quenched her courage for a time , for public opinion is a giant which has frightened <unk> <unk> on bigger <unk> than hers .
Like that immortal hero , she reposed <unk> after the first attempt , which <unk> in a tumble , and the least lovely of the giant &apos;s treasures , if I remember rightly .
But the &quot; up again and take another &quot; spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack ; so she scrambled up , on the shady side this time , and got more <unk> , but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the <unk> .
She took to writing sensation stories ; for in those dark ages , even <unk> America read rubbish .
She told no one , but <unk> a &quot; thrilling tale , &quot; and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood , editor of the &quot; <unk> Volcano . &quot;
She had never read &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more <unk> over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners .
So she dressed herself in her best , and , trying to <unk> herself that she was neither excited nor nervous , bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a <unk> room , a cloud of <unk> , and the presence of three gentlemen , sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats , which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to <unk> on her appearance .
<unk> daunted by this reception , Jo <unk> on the threshold , murmuring in much <unk> , -- &quot; <unk> me , I was looking for the &apos; <unk> Volcano &apos; office ; I wished to see Mr.
Dashwood . &quot;
Down went the highest pair of heels , up rose the <unk> gentleman , and , carefully <unk> his <unk> between his fingers , he <unk> , with a nod , and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep .
Feeling that she must get through the matter somehow , Jo produced her manuscript , and , blushing redder and redder with each sentence , blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion .
&quot; A friend of mine desired me to <unk> <unk> as an <unk> like your <unk> glad to write more if this suits . &quot;
While she blushed and blundered , Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript , and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers , and <unk> <unk> glances up and down the neat pages .
&quot; Not a first attempt , I take it ? &quot;
observing that the pages were <unk> , covered only on one side , and not tied up with a ribbon , <unk> sign of a <unk> .
&quot; No , sir ; she has had some experience , and got a prize for a tale in the &apos; <unk> <unk> . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Oh , did she ? &quot;
and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look , which seemed to take note of everything she had on , from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots .
&quot; Well , you can leave it , if you like .
We &apos;ve more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present ; but I &apos;ll run my eye over it , and give you an answer next week . &quot;
Now , Jo did _ not _ like to leave it , for Mr. Dashwood didn &apos;t suit her at all ; but , under the circumstances , there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away , looking particularly tall and dignified , as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed .
Just then she was both ; for it was perfectly evident , from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen , that her little <unk> of &quot; my friend &quot; was considered a good joke ; and a laugh , produced by some <unk> remark of the editor , as he closed the door , <unk> her <unk> .
Half resolving never to return , she went home , and worked off her <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> ; and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene , and long for next week .
When she went again , Mr. Dashwood was alone , <unk> she rejoiced ; Mr. Dashwood was much <unk> awake than before , which was agreeable ; and Mr. Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a <unk> to remember his manners : so the second <unk> was much more comfortable than the first .
&quot; We &apos;ll take this &quot; ( <unk> never say I ) , &quot; if you don &apos;t object to a few <unk> .
It &apos;s too long , but <unk> the passages I &apos;ve marked will make it just the right length , &quot; he said , in a <unk> tone .
Jo hardly knew her own <unk> again , so crumpled and <unk> were its pages and paragraphs ; but , feeling as a tender <unk> might on being asked to cut off her baby &apos;s legs in order that it might fit into a new <unk> , she looked at the marked passages , and was surprised to find that all the moral <unk> she had carefully put in as <unk> for much <unk> been stricken out .
&quot; But , sir , I thought every story should have some sort of a moral , so I took care to have a few of my sinners <unk> . &quot;
Mr. Dashwood &apos;s <unk> gravity relaxed into a smile , for Jo had forgotten her &quot; friend , &quot; and spoken as only an author could .
&quot; People want to be amused , not preached at , you know .
<unk> don &apos;t sell <unk> ; &quot; which was not quite a correct <unk> , by the way .
&quot; You think it would do with these <unk> , then ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; it &apos;s a new plot , and pretty well worked <unk> good , and so on , &quot; was Mr. Dashwood &apos;s <unk> reply .
&quot; What do <unk> is , what <unk> &quot; began Jo , not exactly knowing how to express herself .
&quot; Oh , yes , well , we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this sort .
<unk> when it comes out , &quot; returned Mr. Dashwood , as if that point had escaped him ; such trifles often do escape the <unk> mind , it is said .
&quot; Very well ; you can have it , &quot; said Jo , handing back the story , with a satisfied air ; for , after the <unk> work , even twenty-five seemed good pay .
&quot; Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this ? &quot;
asked Jo , unconscious of her little slip of the tongue , and <unk> by her success .
&quot; Well , we &apos;ll look at it ; can &apos;t promise to take it .
Tell her to make it short and <unk> , and never mind the moral .
What name would your friend like to put to it ? &quot;
in a careless tone .
&quot; None at all , if you please ; she doesn &apos;t wish her name to appear , and has no _ <unk> de <unk> _ , &quot; said Jo , blushing in spite of herself .
&quot; Just as she likes , of course .
The tale will be out next week ; will you call for the money , or shall I send it ? &quot;
asked Mr. Dashwood , who felt a natural desire to know who his new <unk> might be .
&quot; I &apos;ll call .
Good morning , sir . &quot;
As she departed , Mr. Dashwood put up his feet , with the graceful remark , &quot; Poor and proud , as usual , but she &apos;ll do . &quot;
<unk> Mr. Dashwood &apos;s directions , and making Mrs. <unk> her model , Jo <unk> took a <unk> into the <unk> sea of sensational literature ; but , thanks to the <unk> thrown her by a friend , she came up again , not much the worse for her <unk> .
Like most young <unk> , she went abroad for her characters and scenery ; and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> appeared upon her stage , and played their parts with as much <unk> and spirit as could be expected .
Her readers were not particular about such trifles as <unk> , punctuation , and <unk> , and Mr. Dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his <unk> , on being offered higher <unk> , had basely left him in the <unk> .
She soon became interested in her work , for her <unk> purse grew stout , and the little <unk> she was making to take Beth to the <unk> next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed .
One thing disturbed her satisfaction , and that was that she did not tell them at home .
She had a feeling that father and mother would not approve , and preferred to have her own way first , and beg pardon afterward .
It was easy to keep her secret , for no name appeared with her stories ; Mr. Dashwood had , of course , found it out very soon , but promised to be dumb ; and , for a wonder , kept his word .
She thought it would do her no harm , for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she should be ashamed , and quieted all <unk> of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret .
But Mr. Dashwood <unk> any but thrilling tales ; and , as <unk> could not be produced except by <unk> up the souls of the readers , history and romance , land and sea , <unk> and art , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , had to be <unk> for the purpose .
Jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which <unk> society ; so , regarding it in a business light , she set about <unk> her <unk> with characteristic energy .
<unk> to find material for stories , and bent on making them original in plot , if not <unk> in <unk> , she <unk> newspapers for accidents , <unk> , and <unk> ; she excited the suspicions of public <unk> by asking for works on <unk> ; she studied faces in the street , and characters , good , bad , and indifferent , all about her ; she <unk> in the dust of ancient times for facts or <unk> so old that they were as good as new , and introduced herself to folly , sin , and misery , as well as her limited opportunities allowed .
She thought she was <unk> finely ; but , unconsciously , she was beginning to <unk> some of the <unk> <unk> of a woman &apos;s character .
She was living in bad society ; and , imaginary though it was , its influence affected her , for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and <unk> food , and was fast <unk> the innocent bloom from her nature by a <unk> acquaintance with the <unk> side of life , which comes soon enough to all of us .
She was beginning to feel rather than see this , for much <unk> of other people &apos;s passions and feelings set her to studying and <unk> about her own , --a <unk> amusement , in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge .
<unk> always brings its own punishment ; and , when Jo most needed hers , she got it .
I don &apos;t know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read character , or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest , brave , and strong ; but while <unk> her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun , Jo was <unk> a live hero , who interested her in spite of many human <unk> .
Mr. Bhaer , in one of their <unk> , had advised her to study simple , true , and lovely characters , wherever she found them , as good training for a writer .
Jo took him at his word , for she <unk> turned round and studied him , --a proceeding which would have much surprised him , had he known it , for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own <unk> .
Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo , at first .
He was neither rich nor great , young nor handsome ; in no respect what is called fascinating , <unk> , or brilliant ; and yet he was as attractive as a <unk> fire , and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth .
He was poor , yet always appeared to be giving something away ; a stranger , yet every one was his friend ; no longer young , but as happy-hearted as a boy ; plain and peculiar , yet his face looked beautiful to many , and his <unk> were freely forgiven for his sake .
Jo often watched him , trying to discover the charm , and , at last , decided that it was <unk> which worked the miracle .
If he had any sorrow , &quot; it sat with its head under its <unk> , &quot; and he turned only his sunny side to the world .
There were lines upon his forehead , but Time seemed to have touched him gently , remembering how kind he was to others .
The pleasant <unk> about his mouth were the <unk> of many friendly words and cheery <unk> ; his eyes were never cold or hard , and his big hand had a warm , strong grasp that was more expressive than words .
His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the <unk> .
They looked as if they were at ease , and liked to make him comfortable ; his <unk> waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart <unk> ; his <unk> coat had a social air , and the <unk> pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full ; his very boots were <unk> , and his collars never stiff and <unk> like other people &apos;s .
&quot; That &apos;s it ! &quot;
said Jo to herself , when she at length discovered that genuine good-will towards one &apos;s <unk> could <unk> and <unk> even a stout German teacher , who <unk> in his dinner , <unk> his own socks , and was <unk> with the name of Bhaer .
Jo valued goodness highly , but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect , and a little discovery which she made about the Professor added much to her regard for him .
He never spoke of himself , and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and <unk> for learning and <unk> , till a <unk> came to see him , and , in a conversation with Miss Norton , <unk> the pleasing fact .
From her Jo learned it , and liked it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it .
She felt proud to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin , though only a poor <unk> in America ; and his homely , <unk> life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it .
Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner .
Miss Norton had the _ <unk> � e _ into literary society , which Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her .
The solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl , and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor .
She took them with her , one night , to a select symposium , held in honor of several <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : A select symposium &#93; Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had <unk> with youthful enthusiasm <unk> off .
But her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night , and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all .
<unk> her dismay , on <unk> a glance of timid admiration at the <unk> whose lines suggested an <unk> being fed on &quot; spirit , fire , and dew , &quot; to behold him <unk> his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance .
Turning as from a fallen idol , she made other discoveries which rapidly <unk> her romantic <unk> .
The great <unk> <unk> between two <unk> with the regularity of a <unk> ; the famous divine flirted <unk> with one of the Madame de <unk> <unk> <unk> of the age , who looked <unk> at another <unk> , who was <unk> <unk> her , after <unk> � <unk> her in efforts to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , who <unk> tea <unk> and appeared to <unk> , the <unk> of the lady <unk> speech impossible .
The <unk> <unk> , forgetting their <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> about art , while devoting themselves to <unk> and <unk> with characteristic energy ; the young musician , who was charming the city like a second <unk> , talked horses ; and the <unk> of the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party .
Before the evening was half over , Jo felt so <unk> _ d� � <unk> � e _ , that she sat down in a corner to recover herself .
Mr. Bhaer soon joined her , looking rather out of his element , and presently several of the <unk> , each mounted on his <unk> , came <unk> up to hold an intellectual <unk> in the recess .
The conversation was miles beyond Jo &apos;s <unk> , but she enjoyed it , though <unk> and <unk> were unknown gods , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> terms ; and the only thing &quot; <unk> from her <unk> consciousness , &quot; was a bad headache after it was all over .
It <unk> upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces , and put together on new , and , according to the <unk> , on infinitely better <unk> than before ; that religion was in a fair way to be <unk> into <unk> , and intellect was to be the only God .
Jo knew nothing about philosophy or <unk> of any sort , but a curious excitement , half <unk> , half painful , came over her , as she listened with a sense of being turned <unk> into time and <unk> , like a young <unk> out on a holiday .
She looked round to see how the Professor liked it , and found him looking at her with the <unk> expression she had ever seen him wear .
He shook his head , and beckoned her to come away ; but she was <unk> , just then , by the freedom of <unk> <unk> , and kept her seat , trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to <unk> upon after they had <unk> all the old beliefs .
Now , Mr. Bhaer was a <unk> man , and slow to offer his own <unk> , not because they were unsettled , but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken .
As he glanced from Jo to several other young people , attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic <unk> , he knit his brows , and longed to speak , fearing that some <unk> young soul would be led <unk> by the <unk> , to find , when the display was over , that they had only an empty <unk> or a scorched hand .
He bore it as long as he could ; but when he was <unk> to for an opinion , he <unk> up with honest indignation , and defended religion with all the eloquence of truth , <unk> eloquence which made his broken English musical , and his plain face beautiful .
He had a hard fight , for the wise men <unk> well ; but he didn &apos;t know when he was <unk> , and stood to his colors like a man .
Somehow , as he talked , the world got right again to Jo ; the old beliefs , that had lasted so long , seemed better than the new ; God was not a blind force , and <unk> was not a pretty fable , but a blessed fact .
She felt as if she had <unk> ground under her feet again ; and when Mr. Bhaer paused , <unk> , but not one <unk> <unk> , Jo wanted to <unk> her hands and thank him .
She did neither ; but she remembered this scene , and gave the Professor her <unk> respect , for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there , because his conscience would not let him be silent .
She began to see that character is a better possession than money , rank , intellect , or beauty ; and to feel that if <unk> is what a wise man has <unk> it to be , &quot; truth , reverence , and good-will , &quot; then her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good , but great .
This belief strengthened daily .
She valued his <unk> , she coveted his respect , she wanted to be worthy of his friendship ; and , just when the wish was <unk> , she came near losing everything .
It all grew out of a cocked hat ; for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo her lesson , with a paper <unk> on his head , which Tina had put there , and he had forgotten to take off .
&quot; It &apos;s evident he doesn &apos;t look in his glass before coming down , &quot; thought Jo , with a smile , as he said &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and sat soberly down , quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his <unk> , for he was going to read her the &quot; <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : He doesn &apos;t prink at his glass before coming &#93; She said nothing at first , for she liked to hear him laugh out his big , hearty laugh , when anything funny happened , so she left him to discover it for himself , and presently forgot all about it ; for to hear a German read Schiller is rather an <unk> <unk> .
After the reading came the lesson , which was a lively one , for Jo was in a gay mood that night , and the <unk> kept her eyes dancing with merriment .
The Professor didn &apos;t know what to make of her , and stopped at last , to ask , with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible , -- &quot; Mees Marsch , for what do you laugh in your master &apos;s face ?
<unk> you no respect for me , that you go on so bad ? &quot;
&quot; How can I be respectful , sir , when you forget to take your hat off ? &quot;
said Jo .
<unk> his hand to his head , the absent-minded Professor gravely felt and removed the little <unk> , looked at it a minute , and then threw back his head , and laughed like a merry <unk> .
&quot; Ah !
I see him now ; it is that <unk> Tina who makes me a fool with my cap .
Well , it is nothing ; but see you , if this lesson goes not well , you too shall wear him . &quot;
But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes , because Mr. Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat , and , unfolding it , said , with an air of great disgust , -- &quot; I wish these papers did not come in the house ; they are not for children to see , nor young people to read .
It is not well , and I haf no patience with those who make this harm . &quot;
Jo glanced at the sheet , and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a <unk> , a <unk> , a villain , and a <unk> .
She did not like it ; but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of <unk> , but fear , because , for a minute , she fancied the paper was the &quot; Volcano . &quot;
It was not , however , and her panic subsided as she remembered that , even if it had been , and one of her own tales in it , there would have been no name to betray her .
She had betrayed herself , however , by a look and a blush ; for , though an absent man , the Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied .
He knew that Jo wrote , and had met her down among the newspaper <unk> more than once ; but as she never spoke of it , he asked no questions , in spite of a strong desire to see her work .
Now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own , and it troubled him .
He did not say to himself , &quot; It is none of my business ; I &apos;ve no right to say anything , &quot; as many people would have done ; he only remembered that she was young and poor , a girl far away from mother &apos;s love and father &apos;s care ; and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would <unk> him to put out his hand to save a baby from a <unk> .
All this flashed through his mind in a minute , but not a <unk> of it appeared in his face ; and by the time the paper was turned , and Jo &apos;s needle <unk> , he was ready to say quite naturally , but very gravely , -- &quot; Yes , you are right to put it from you .
I do not like to think that good young girls should see such things .
They are made pleasant to some , but I would more rather give my boys <unk> to play with than this bad trash . &quot;
&quot; All may not be bad , only silly , you know ; and if there is a demand for it , I don &apos;t see any harm in <unk> it .
Many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories , &quot; said Jo , scratching <unk> so energetically that a row of little <unk> followed her pin .
&quot; There is a demand for <unk> , but I think you and I do not care to sell it .
If the respectable people knew what harm they did , they would not feel that the living _ was _ honest .
They haf no right to put <unk> in the <unk> , and let the small ones eat it .
No ; they should think a little , and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing . &quot;
Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly , and walked to the fire , <unk> the paper in his hands .
Jo sat still , looking as if the fire had come to her ; for her cheeks <unk> long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke , and gone <unk> up the <unk> .
&quot; I should like much to send all the rest after him , &quot; muttered the Professor , coming back with a relieved air .
Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make , and her <unk> money lay rather <unk> on her conscience at that minute .
Then she thought consolingly to herself , &quot; Mine are not like that ; they are only silly , never bad , so I won &apos;t be worried ; &quot; and taking up her book , she said , with a studious face , -- &quot; Shall we go on , sir ?
I &apos;ll be very good and proper now . &quot;
&quot; I shall hope so , &quot; was all he said , but he meant more than she imagined ; and the grave , kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words &quot; <unk> Volcano &quot; were printed in large <unk> on her forehead .
As soon as she went to her room , she got out her papers , and carefully <unk> every one of her stories .
Being a little short-sighted , Mr. Bhaer sometimes used <unk> , and Jo had tried them once , smiling to see how they <unk> the fine print of her book ; now she seemed to have got on the Professor &apos;s mental or moral spectacles also ; for the faults of these poor stories <unk> at her dreadfully , and filled her with dismay .
&quot; They _ are _ trash , and will soon be worse than trash if I go on ; for each is more sensational than the last .
I &apos;ve gone blindly on , <unk> myself and other people , for the sake of money ; I know it &apos;s so , for I can &apos;t read this stuff in sober earnest without being <unk> ashamed of it ; and what _ should _ I do if they were seen at home , or Mr. Bhaer got hold of them ? &quot;
Jo turned hot at the bare idea , and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove , nearly setting the <unk> <unk> with the blaze .
&#91; Illustration : Jo stuffed the whole bundle into the stove &#93; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s the best place for such <unk> nonsense ; I &apos;d better burn the house down , I suppose , than let other people blow themselves up with my <unk> , &quot; she thought , as she watched the &quot; <unk> of the <unk> &quot; whisk away , a little black <unk> with <unk> eyes .
But when nothing remained of all her three months &apos; work except a heap of <unk> , and the money in her lap , Jo looked sober , as she sat on the floor , wondering what she ought to do about her <unk> .
&quot; I think I haven &apos;t done much harm _ yet _ , and may keep this to pay for my time , &quot; she said , after a long <unk> , adding impatiently , &quot; I almost wish I hadn &apos;t any conscience , it &apos;s so <unk> .
If I didn &apos;t care about doing right , and didn &apos;t feel uncomfortable when doing wrong , I should get on capitally .
I can &apos;t help wishing sometimes , that father and mother hadn &apos;t been so particular about such things . &quot;
Ah , Jo , instead of wishing that , thank God that &quot; father and mother _ were _ particular , &quot; and pity from your heart those who have no such <unk> to hedge them round with <unk> which may seem like <unk> to impatient youth , but which will prove sure <unk> to <unk> character upon in womanhood .
Jo wrote no more sensational stories , <unk> that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation ; but , going to the other <unk> , as is the way with people of her <unk> , she took a course of Mrs. <unk> , Miss <unk> , and Hannah More ; and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an <unk> or a sermon , so <unk> moral was it .
She had her doubts about it from the beginning ; for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done <unk> in the stiff and <unk> costume of the last <unk> .
She sent this <unk> <unk> to several <unk> , but it found no <unk> ; and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood , that <unk> didn &apos;t sell .
Then she tried a child &apos;s story , which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand <unk> <unk> for it .
The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try <unk> literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to <unk> all the world to his particular belief .
But much as she liked to write for children , Jo could not consent to <unk> all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad <unk> , because they did not go to a particular <unk> , nor all the good infants , who did go , as <unk> by every kind of bliss , from <unk> gingerbread to <unk> of angels , when they departed this life with <unk> or sermons on their <unk> tongues .
So nothing came of these trials ; and Jo <unk> up her inkstand , and said , in a fit of very wholesome humility , -- &quot; I don &apos;t know anything ; I &apos;ll wait till I do before I try again , and , meantime , &apos; sweep mud in the street , &apos; if I can &apos;t do better ; that &apos;s honest , at least ; &quot; which decision proved that her second tumble down the <unk> had done her some good .
While these <unk> <unk> were going on , her <unk> life had been as busy and <unk> as usual ; and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer .
He did it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and <unk> by his <unk> ; but she stood the test , and he was satisfied ; for , though no words passed between them , he knew that she had given up writing .
Not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer <unk> , but she spent her evenings downstairs now , was met no more among newspaper <unk> , and studied with a <unk> patience , which assured him that she was bent on <unk> her mind with something useful , if not pleasant .
He helped her in many ways , proving himself a true friend , and Jo was happy ; for , while her pen lay idle , she was learning other lessons beside German , and laying a <unk> for the sensation story of her own life .
It was a pleasant winter and a long one , for she did not leave Mrs. Kirke till June .
Every one seemed sorry when the time came ; the children were <unk> , and Mr. Bhaer &apos;s hair stuck straight up all over his head , for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind .
&quot; Going home ?
Ah , you are happy that you haf a home to go in , &quot; he said , when she told him , and sat silently pulling his beard , in the corner , while she held a little <unk> on that last evening .
She was going early , so she bade them all good-by over night ; and when his turn came , she said warmly , -- &quot; Now , sir , you won &apos;t forget to come and see us , if you ever travel our way , will you ?
I &apos;ll never forgive you if you do , for I want them all to know my friend . &quot;
&quot; Do you ?
Shall I come ? &quot;
he asked , looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see .
&quot; Yes , come next month ; Laurie <unk> then , and you &apos;d enjoy <unk> as something new . &quot;
&quot; That is your best friend , of whom you speak ? &quot;
he said , in an altered tone .
&quot; Yes , my boy Teddy ; I &apos;m very proud of him , and should like you to see him . &quot;
Jo looked up then , quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another .
Something in Mr. Bhaer &apos;s face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than a &quot; best friend , &quot; and , simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter , she involuntarily began to blush ; and the more she tried not to , the redder she grew .
If it had not been for Tina on her knee , she didn &apos;t know what would have become of her .
Fortunately , the child was moved to hug her ; so she managed to hide her face an instant , hoping the Professor did not see it .
But he did , and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression , as he said cordially , -- &quot; I fear I shall not make the time for that , but I wish the friend much success , and you all happiness .
Gott bless you ! &quot;
and with that , he shook hands warmly , <unk> Tina , and went away .
But after the boys were <unk> , he sat long before his fire , with the tired look on his face , and the &quot; _ <unk> _ , &quot; or <unk> , lying heavy at his heart .
Once , when he remembered Jo , as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new <unk> in her face , he leaned his head on his hands a minute , and then roamed about the room , as if in search of something that he could not find .
&quot; It is not for me ; I must not hope it now , &quot; he said to himself , with a sigh that was almost a groan ; then , as if <unk> himself for the longing that he could not <unk> , he went and kissed the two <unk> heads upon the pillow , took down his <unk> <unk> , and opened his Plato .
He did his best , and did it manfully ; but I don &apos;t think he found that a pair of <unk> boys , a <unk> , or even the divine Plato , were very satisfactory <unk> for wife and child and home .
<unk> as it was , he was at the <unk> , next morning , to see Jo off ; and , thanks to him , she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell , a bunch of <unk> to keep her company , and , best of all , the happy thought , -- &quot; Well , the winter &apos;s gone , and I &apos;ve written no books , earned no fortune ; but I &apos;ve made a friend worth having , and I &apos;ll try to keep him all my life . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : He put the sisters into the carriage &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
Whatever his <unk> might have been , Laurie studied to some purpose that year , for he <unk> with honor , and gave the Latin <unk> with the grace of a <unk> and the eloquence of a <unk> , so his friends said .
They were all there , his grandfather , <unk> , so proud ! <unk> .
and Mrs. March , John and Meg , Jo and Beth , and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time , but fail to win from the world by any <unk> .
&quot; I &apos;ve got to stay for this confounded supper , but I shall be home early to-morrow ; you &apos;ll come and meet me as usual , girls ? &quot;
Laurie said , as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over .
He said &quot; girls , &quot; but he meant Jo , for she was the only one who kept up the old <unk> ; she had not the heart to refuse her splendid , successful boy anything , and answered warmly , -- &quot; I &apos;ll come , Teddy , rain or shine , and march before you , playing &apos; _ <unk> the <unk> hero comes _ , &apos; on a <unk> . &quot;
Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think , in a sudden panic , &quot; Oh , deary me !
I know he &apos;ll say something , and then what shall I do ? &quot;
<unk> <unk> and morning work somewhat <unk> her fears , and having decided that she wouldn &apos;t be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be , she set forth at the <unk> time , hoping Teddy wouldn &apos;t do anything to make her hurt his poor little feelings .
A call at Meg &apos;s , and a refreshing sniff and <unk> at the Daisy and <unk> , still further <unk> her for the _ <unk> <unk> _ , but when she saw a <unk> figure <unk> in the distance , she had a strong desire to turn about and run away .
&quot; Where &apos;s the <unk> , Jo ? &quot;
cried Laurie , as soon as he was within speaking distance .
&quot; I forgot it ; &quot; and Jo took heart again , for that <unk> could not be called <unk> .
She always used to take his arm on these occasions ; now she did not , and he made no <unk> , which was a bad sign , but talked on rapidly about all sorts of <unk> <unk> , till they turned from the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove .
Then he walked more slowly , suddenly lost his fine <unk> of language , and , now and then , a dreadful pause occurred .
To rescue the conversation from one of the <unk> of silence into which it kept falling , Jo said hastily , -- &quot; Now you must have a good long holiday ! &quot;
&quot; I intend to . &quot;
Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come , and made her put out her hand with an imploring , -- &quot; No , Teddy , please don &apos;t ! &quot;
&quot; I will , and you _ must _ hear me .
It &apos;s no use , Jo ; we &apos;ve got to have it out , and the sooner the better for both of us , &quot; he answered , getting flushed and excited all at once .
&quot; Say what you like , then ; I &apos;ll listen , &quot; said Jo , with a desperate sort of patience .
Laurie was a young lover , but he was in earnest , and meant to &quot; have it out , &quot; if he died in the attempt ; so he <unk> into the subject with characteristic <unk> , saying in a voice that _ would _ get <unk> now and then , in spite of <unk> efforts to keep it steady , -- &quot; I &apos;ve loved you ever since I &apos;ve known you , Jo ; couldn &apos;t help it , you &apos;ve been so good to me .
I &apos;ve tried to show it , but you wouldn &apos;t let me ; now I &apos;m going to make you hear , and give me an answer , for I _ can &apos;t _ go on so any longer . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to save you this ; I thought you &apos;d <unk> &quot; began Jo , finding it a great deal harder than she expected .
&quot; I know you did ; but girls are so queer you never know what they mean .
They say No when they mean Yes , and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it , &quot; returned Laurie , <unk> himself behind an <unk> fact .
&quot; _ I _ don &apos;t .
I never wanted to make you care for me so , and I went away to keep you from it if I could . &quot;
&quot; I thought so ; it was like you , but it was no use .
I only loved you all the more , and I worked hard to please you , and I gave up <unk> and everything you didn &apos;t like , and waited and never complained , for I hoped you &apos;d love me , though I &apos;m not half good <unk> &quot; here there was a choke that couldn &apos;t be <unk> , so he <unk> <unk> while he cleared his &quot; confounded throat . &quot;
&quot; Yes , you are ; you &apos;re a great deal too good for me , and I &apos;m so grateful to you , and so proud and fond of you , I don &apos;t see why I can &apos;t love you as you want me to .
I &apos;ve tried , but I can &apos;t change the feeling , and it would be a lie to say I do when I don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; Really , truly , Jo ? &quot;
He stopped short , and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget .
&quot; Really , truly , dear . &quot;
They were in the grove now , close by the <unk> ; and when the last words fell reluctantly from Jo &apos;s lips , Laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on , but for once in his life that fence was too much for him ; so he just laid his head down on the mossy post , and stood so still that Jo was frightened .
&#91; Illustration : He laid his head down on the mossy post &#93; &quot; O Teddy , I &apos;m so sorry , so desperately sorry , I could kill myself if it would do any good !
I wish you wouldn &apos;t take it so hard .
I can &apos;t help it ; you know it &apos;s impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they don &apos;t , &quot; cried Jo <unk> but <unk> , as she softly patted his shoulder , remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago .
&quot; They do sometimes , &quot; said a muffled voice from the post .
&quot; I don &apos;t believe it &apos;s the right sort of love , and I &apos;d rather not try it , &quot; was the decided answer .
There was a long pause , while a <unk> sung blithely on the <unk> by the river , and the tall grass rustled in the wind .
Presently Jo said very soberly , as she sat down on the step of the <unk> , -- &quot; Laurie , I want to tell you something . &quot;
He started as if he had been shot , threw up his head , and cried out , in a fierce <unk> &quot; _ Don &apos;t _ tell me that , Jo ; I can &apos;t bear it now ! &quot;
&quot; Tell what ? &quot;
she asked , wondering at his <unk> .
&quot; That you love that old man . &quot;
&quot; What old man ? &quot;
demanded Jo , thinking he must mean his grandfather .
&quot; That <unk> Professor you were always writing about .
If you say you love him , I know I shall do something desperate ; &quot; and he looked as if he would keep his word , as he <unk> his hands , with a wrathful <unk> in his eyes .
Jo wanted to laugh , but restrained herself , and said warmly , for she , too , was getting excited with all this , -- &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> , Teddy !
He isn &apos;t old , nor anything bad , but good and kind , and the best friend I &apos;ve got , next to you .
Pray , don &apos;t fly into a passion ; I want to be kind , but I know I shall get angry if you <unk> my Professor .
I haven &apos;t the least idea of loving him or anybody else . &quot;
&quot; But you will after a while , and then what will become of me ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll love some one else too , like a sensible boy , and forget all this trouble . &quot;
&quot; I _ can &apos;t _ love any one else ; and I &apos;ll never forget you , Jo , never !
never ! &quot;
with a <unk> to <unk> his passionate words .
&quot; What _ shall _ I do with him ? &quot;
sighed Jo , finding that emotions were more <unk> than she expected .
&quot; You haven &apos;t heard what I wanted to tell you .
Sit down and listen ; for indeed I want to do right and make you happy , &quot; she said , hoping to soothe him with a little reason , which proved that she knew nothing about love .
Seeing a <unk> of hope in that last speech , Laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet , leaned his arm on the lower step of the <unk> , and looked up at her with an <unk> face .
Now that arrangement was not <unk> to calm speech or clear thought on Jo &apos;s part ; for how _ could _ she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing , and <unk> still wet with the bitter drop or two her <unk> of heart had wrung from him ?
She gently turned his head away , saying , as she <unk> the <unk> hair which had been allowed to grow for her sake , --how touching that was , to be sure ! -- &quot; I agree with mother that you and I are not suited to each other , because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable , if we were so foolish as <unk> &quot; Jo paused a little over the last word , but Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression , -- &quot; <unk> , <unk> , we shouldn &apos;t !
If you loved me , Jo , I should be a perfect saint , for you could make me anything you like . &quot;
&quot; No , I can &apos;t .
I &apos;ve tried it and failed , and I won &apos;t <unk> our happiness by such a serious experiment .
We don &apos;t agree and we never shall ; so we &apos;ll be good friends all our lives , but we won &apos;t go and do anything rash . &quot;
&quot; Yes , we will if we get the chance , &quot; muttered Laurie rebelliously .
&quot; Now do be reasonable , and take a sensible view of the case , &quot; implored Jo , almost at her <unk> &apos;s end .
&quot; I won &apos;t be reasonable ; I don &apos;t want to take what you call &apos; a sensible view ; &apos; it won &apos;t help me , and it only makes you harder .
I don &apos;t believe you &apos;ve got any heart . &quot;
&quot; I wish I hadn &apos;t ! &quot;
There was a little quiver in Jo &apos;s voice , and , thinking it a good omen , Laurie turned round , bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he said , in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so <unk> wheedlesome before , -- &quot; Don &apos;t disappoint us , dear !
Every one <unk> it .
Grandpa has set his heart upon it , your people like it , and I can &apos;t get on without you .
Say you will , and let &apos;s be happy .
Do , do ! &quot;
Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy , and never could .
It was very hard to do , but she did it , knowing that delay was both <unk> and cruel .
&quot; I can &apos;t say &apos; Yes &apos; truly , so I won &apos;t say it at all .
You &apos;ll see that I &apos;m right , by and by , and thank me for it &quot; <unk> began solemnly .
&quot; I &apos;ll be <unk> if I do ! &quot;
and Laurie bounced up off the grass , burning with indignation at the bare idea .
&quot; Yes , you will ! &quot;
persisted Jo ; &quot; you &apos;ll get over this after a while , and find some lovely , accomplished girl , who will adore you , and make a fine mistress for your fine house .
I shouldn &apos;t .
I &apos;m homely and awkward and odd and old , and you &apos;d be ashamed of me , and we should quarrel , <unk> can &apos;t help it even now , you see , --and I shouldn &apos;t like elegant society and you would , and you &apos;d hate my scribbling , and I couldn &apos;t get on without it , and we should be unhappy , and wish we hadn &apos;t done it , and everything would be horrid ! &quot;
&quot; Anything more ? &quot;
asked Laurie , finding it hard to listen patiently to this <unk> burst .
&quot; Nothing more , except that I don &apos;t believe I shall ever marry .
I &apos;m happy as I am , and love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up for any mortal man . &quot;
&quot; I know better ! &quot;
broke in Laurie .
&quot; You think so now ; but there &apos;ll come a time when you _ will _ care for somebody , and you &apos;ll love him tremendously , and live and die for him .
I know you will , it &apos;s your way , and I shall have to stand by and see it ; &quot; and the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical , if his face had not been so tragical .
&quot; Yes , I _ will _ live and die for him , if he ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself , and you must do the best you can ! &quot;
cried Jo , losing patience with poor Teddy .
&quot; I &apos;ve done my best , but you _ won &apos;t _ be reasonable , and it &apos;s selfish of you to keep <unk> for what I can &apos;t give .
I shall always be fond of you , very fond indeed , as a friend , but I &apos;ll never marry you ; and the sooner you believe it , the better for both of us , --so now ! &quot;
That speech was like fire to <unk> .
Laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself , then turned sharply away , saying , in a desperate sort of tone , -- &quot; You &apos;ll be sorry some day , Jo . &quot;
&quot; Oh , where are you going ? &quot;
she cried , for his face frightened her .
&quot; To the <unk> ! &quot;
was the <unk> answer .
For a minute Jo &apos;s heart stood still , as he swung himself down the bank , toward the river ; but it takes much folly , sin , or misery to send a young man to a violent death , and Laurie was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure .
He had no thought of a melodramatic <unk> , but some blind instinct led him to <unk> hat and coat into his boat , and row away with all his might , making better time up the river than he had done in many a race .
Jo drew a long breath and <unk> her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to <unk> the trouble which he carried in his heart .
&quot; That will do him good , and he &apos;ll come home in such a tender , penitent state of mind , that I sha &apos;n&apos;t dare to see him , &quot; she said ; adding , as she went slowly home , feeling as if she had <unk> some innocent thing , and buried it under the leaves , -- &quot; Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy .
I wish he &apos;d love Beth ; perhaps he may , in time , but I begin to think I was mistaken about her .
Oh dear !
how can girls like to have lovers and refuse them .
I think it &apos;s dreadful . &quot;
Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself , she went straight to Mr. Laurence , told the hard story bravely through , and then broke down , crying so dismally over her own <unk> that the kind old gentleman , though sorely disappointed , did not utter a reproach .
He found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie , and hoped she would change her mind , but he knew even better than Jo that love cannot be forced , so he shook his head sadly , and resolved to carry his boy out of harm &apos;s way ; for Young <unk> &apos;s parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess .
When Laurie came home , dead tired , but quite composed , his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing , and kept up the delusion very <unk> for an hour or two .
But when they sat together in the twilight , the time they used to enjoy so much , it was hard work for the old man to <unk> on as usual , and harder still for the young one to listen to <unk> of the last year &apos;s success , which to him now seemed love &apos;s labor lost .
He bore it as long as he could , then went to his piano , and began to play .
The windows were open ; and Jo , walking in the garden with Beth , for once understood music better than her sister , for he played the &quot; <unk> <unk> � <unk> , &quot; and played it as he never did before .
&quot; That &apos;s very fine , I dare say , but it &apos;s sad enough to make one cry ; give us something <unk> , lad , &quot; said Mr. Laurence , whose kind old heart was full of sympathy , which he longed to show , but knew not how .
Laurie <unk> into a <unk> strain , played <unk> for several minutes , and would have got through bravely , if , in a momentary lull , Mrs. March &apos;s voice had not been heard calling , -- &quot; Jo , dear , come in ; I want you . &quot;
Just what Laurie longed to say , with a different meaning !
As he listened , he lost his place ; the music ended with a broken <unk> , and the musician sat silent in the dark .
&quot; I can &apos;t stand this , &quot; muttered the old gentleman .
Up he got , <unk> his way to the piano , laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders , and said , as gently as a woman , -- &quot; I know , my boy , I know . &quot;
No answer for an instant ; then Laurie asked sharply , -- &quot; Who told you ? &quot;
&quot; Jo herself . &quot;
&quot; Then there &apos;s an end of it ! &quot;
and he shook off his grandfather &apos;s hands with an impatient motion ; for , though grateful for the sympathy , his man &apos;s pride could not bear a man &apos;s pity .
&quot; Not quite ; I want to say one thing , and then there shall be an end of it , &quot; returned Mr. Laurence , with unusual <unk> .
&quot; You won &apos;t care to stay at home just now , perhaps ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t intend to run away from a girl .
Jo can &apos;t prevent my seeing her , and I shall stay and do it as long as I like , &quot; interrupted Laurie , in a <unk> tone .
&quot; Not if you are the gentleman I think you .
I &apos;m disappointed , but the girl can &apos;t help it ; and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time .
Where will you go ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> .
I don &apos;t care what becomes of me ; &quot; and Laurie got up , with a <unk> laugh , that <unk> on his grandfather &apos;s ear .
&quot; Take it like a man , and don &apos;t do anything rash , for God &apos;s sake .
Why not go abroad , as you planned , and forget it ? &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; But you &apos;ve been wild to go , and I promised you should when you got through college . &quot;
&quot; Ah , but I didn &apos;t mean to go alone ! &quot;
and Laurie walked fast through the room , with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see .
&quot; I don &apos;t ask you to go alone ; there &apos;s some one ready and glad to go with you , anywhere in the world . &quot;
&quot; Who , sir ? &quot;
stopping to listen .
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
Laurie came back as quickly as he went , and put out his hand , saying <unk> , -- &quot; I &apos;m a selfish <unk> ; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; Lord help me , yes , I do know , for I &apos;ve been through it all before , once in my own young days , and then with your father .
Now , my dear boy , just sit quietly down , and hear my plan .
It &apos;s all settled , and can be carried out at once , &quot; said Mr. Laurence , keeping hold of the young man , as if fearful that he would break away , as his father had done before him .
&quot; Well , sir , what is it ? &quot;
and Laurie sat down , without a sign of interest in face or voice .
&quot; There is business in London that needs looking after ; I meant you should attend to it ; but I can do it better myself , and things here will get on very well with Brooke to manage them .
My <unk> do almost everything ; I &apos;m merely holding on till you take my place , and can be off at any time . &quot;
&quot; But you hate travelling , sir ; I can &apos;t ask it of you at your age , &quot; began Laurie , who was grateful for the sacrifice , but much preferred to go alone , if he went at all .
The old gentleman knew that perfectly well , and particularly desired to prevent it ; for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices .
So , <unk> a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him , he said stoutly , -- &quot; Bless your soul , I &apos;m not <unk> yet .
I quite enjoy the idea ; it will do me good , and my old <unk> won &apos;t suffer , for travelling <unk> is almost as easy as sitting in a chair . &quot;
A restless movement from Laurie suggested that _ his _ chair was not easy , or that he did not like the plan , and made the old man add hastily , -- &quot; I don &apos;t mean to be a <unk> or a burden ; I go because I think you &apos;d feel happier than if I was left behind .
I don &apos;t intend to <unk> about with you , but leave you free to go where you like , while I amuse myself in my own way .
I &apos;ve friends in London and Paris , and should like to visit them ; meantime you can go to Italy , Germany , Switzerland , where you will , and enjoy pictures , music , scenery , and adventures to your heart &apos;s content . &quot;
Now , Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken , and the world a <unk> wilderness ; but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman <unk> introduced into his <unk> sentence , the broken heart gave an unexpected leap , and a green <unk> or two suddenly appeared in the <unk> wilderness .
He sighed , and then said , in a <unk> tone , -- &quot; Just as you like , sir ; it doesn &apos;t matter where I go or what I do . &quot;
&quot; It does to me , remember that , my lad ; I give you entire liberty , but I trust you to make an honest use of it .
<unk> me that , Laurie . &quot;
&quot; Anything you like , sir . &quot;
&quot; Good , &quot; thought the old gentleman .
&quot; You don &apos;t care now , but there &apos;ll come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief , or I &apos;m much mistaken . &quot;
Being an energetic individual , Mr. Laurence struck while the <unk> was hot ; and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel , they were off .
During the time necessary for preparation , Laurie bore himself as young gentlemen usually do in such <unk> .
He was moody , <unk> , and pensive by turns ; lost his appetite , neglected his dress , and devoted much time to playing <unk> on his piano ; <unk> Jo , but consoled himself by staring at her from his window , with a tragical face that haunted her dreams by night , and <unk> her with a heavy sense of <unk> by day .
<unk> some <unk> , he never spoke of his <unk> passion , and would allow no one , not even Mrs. March , to attempt consolation or offer sympathy .
On some accounts , this was a relief to his friends ; but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable , and every one rejoiced that the &quot; poor , dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble , and come home happy . &quot;
Of course , he smiled darkly at their delusion , but passed it by , with the sad <unk> of one who knew that his <unk> , like his love , was <unk> .
When the parting came he affected high spirits , to conceal certain <unk> emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves .
This <unk> did not <unk> upon anybody , but they tried to look as if it did , for his sake , and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him , with a whisper full of motherly <unk> ; then , feeling that he was going very fast , he hastily <unk> them all round , not forgetting the afflicted Hannah , and ran downstairs as if for his life .
Jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round .
He did look round , came back , put his arms about her , as she stood on the step above him , and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal both eloquent and pathetic .
&quot; O Jo , can &apos;t you ? &quot;
&#91; Illustration : O Jo , can &apos;t you ? &#93;
&quot; Teddy , dear , I wish I could ! &quot;
That was all , except a little pause ; then Laurie <unk> himself up , said &quot; It &apos;s all right , never mind , &quot; and went away without another word .
Ah , but it wasn &apos;t all right , and Jo _ did _ mind ; for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer , she felt as if she had <unk> her dearest friend ; and when he left her without a look behind him , she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; <unk> .
BETH &apos;S <unk> .
When Jo came home that spring , she had been struck with the change in Beth .
No one spoke of it or seemed <unk> of it , for it had come too gradually to <unk> those who saw her daily ; but to eyes <unk> by absence , it was very plain ; and a heavy weight fell on Jo &apos;s heart as she saw her sister &apos;s face .
It was no <unk> and but little <unk> than in the autumn ; yet there was a strange , <unk> look about it , as if the mortal was being slowly <unk> away , and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an <unk> pathetic beauty .
Jo saw and felt it , but said nothing at the time , and soon the first impression lost much of its power ; for Beth seemed happy , no one appeared to doubt that she was better ; and , presently , in other cares , Jo for a time forgot her fear .
But when Laurie was gone , and peace prevailed again , the vague anxiety returned and haunted her .
She had confessed her sins and been forgiven ; but when she showed her <unk> and proposed the mountain trip , Beth had thanked her heartily , but begged not to go so far away from home .
Another little visit to the <unk> would suit her better , and , as grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies , Jo took Beth down to the quiet place , where she could live much in the open air , and let the fresh <unk> blow a little color into her pale cheeks .
It was not a fashionable place , but , even among the pleasant people there , the girls made few friends , <unk> to live for one another .
Beth was too shy to enjoy society , and Jo too wrapped up in her to care for any one else ; so they were all in all to each other , and came and went , quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about them , who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one , always together , as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away .
They did feel it , yet neither spoke of it ; for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there <unk> a <unk> which it is very hard to overcome .
Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and Beth &apos;s ; but when she put out her hand to lift it up , there seemed something sacred in the silence , and she waited for Beth to speak .
She wondered , and was <unk> also , that her parents did not seem to see what she saw ; and , during the quiet weeks , when the shadow grew so plain to her , she said nothing of it to those at home , believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better .
She wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth , and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm <unk> , with her head in Jo &apos;s lap , while the winds blew healthfully over her , and the sea made music at her feet .
&#91; Illustration : With her head in Jo &apos;s lap , while the wind blew healthfully over her &#93; One day Beth told her .
Jo thought she was asleep , she lay so still ; and , putting down her book , sat looking at her with wistful eyes , trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth &apos;s cheeks .
But she could not find enough to satisfy her , for the cheeks were very thin , and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little <unk> they had been gathering .
It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was slowly <unk> away from her , and her arms instinctively <unk> their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed .
For a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing , and , when they cleared , Beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say , -- &quot; Jo , dear , I &apos;m glad you know it .
I &apos;ve tried to tell you , but I couldn &apos;t . &quot;
There was no answer except her sister &apos;s cheek against her own , not even tears ; for when most deeply moved , Jo did not cry .
She was the <unk> , then , and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her , with her arms about her , and the soothing words she whispered in her ear .
&quot; I &apos;ve known it for a good while , dear , and , now I &apos;m used to it , it isn &apos;t hard to think of or to bear .
Try to see it so , and don &apos;t be troubled about me , because it &apos;s best ; indeed it is . &quot;
&quot; Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn , Beth ?
You did not feel it then , and keep it to yourself so long , did you ? &quot;
asked Jo , <unk> to see or say that it _ was _ best , but glad to know that Laurie had no part in Beth &apos;s trouble .
&quot; Yes , I gave up hoping then , but I didn &apos;t like to own it .
I tried to think it was a sick fancy , and would not let it trouble any one .
But when I saw you all so well and strong , and full of happy plans , it was hard to feel that I could never be like you , and then I was miserable , Jo . &quot;
&quot; O Beth , and you didn &apos;t tell me , didn &apos;t let me comfort and help you !
How could you shut me out , and bear it all alone ? &quot;
Jo &apos;s voice was full of tender reproach , and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say good-by to health , love , and life , and take up her cross so cheerfully .
&quot; Perhaps it was wrong , but I tried to do right ; I wasn &apos;t sure , no one said anything , and I hoped I was mistaken .
It would have been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg , and Amy away , and you so happy with Laurie , --at least , I thought so then . &quot;
&quot; And I thought that you loved him , Beth , and I went away because I couldn &apos;t , &quot; cried Jo , glad to say all the truth .
Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain , and added softly , -- &quot; Then you didn &apos;t , deary ?
I was afraid it was so , and imagined your poor little heart full of love-lornity all that while . &quot;
&quot; Why , Jo , how could I , when he was so fond of you ? &quot;
asked Beth , as innocently as a child .
&quot; I do love him dearly ; he is so good to me , how can I help it ?
But he never could be anything to me but my brother .
I hope he truly will be , <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Not through me , &quot; said Jo decidedly .
&quot; Amy is left for him , and they would suit excellently ; but I have no heart for such things , now .
I don &apos;t care what becomes of anybody but you , Beth .
You _ must _ get well . &quot;
&quot; I want to , oh , so much !
I try , but every day I lose a little , and feel more sure that I shall never <unk> it back .
It &apos;s like the tide , Jo , when it turns , it goes slowly , but it can &apos;t be stopped . &quot;
&quot; It _ shall _ be stopped , your tide must not turn so soon , nineteen is too young .
Beth , I can &apos;t let you go .
I &apos;ll work and pray and fight against it .
I &apos;ll keep you in spite of everything ; there must be ways , it can &apos;t be too late .
God won &apos;t be so cruel as to take you from me , &quot; cried poor Jo rebelliously , for her spirit was far less <unk> submissive than Beth &apos;s .
Simple , sincere people seldom speak much of their <unk> ; it shows itself in acts , rather than in words , and has more influence than <unk> or <unk> .
Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life , and cheerfully wait for death .
Like a confiding child , she asked no questions , but left everything to God and nature , Father and mother of us all , feeling sure that they , and they only , could teach and <unk> heart and spirit for this life and the life to come .
She did not <unk> Jo with saintly speeches , only loved her better for her passionate affection , and clung more closely to the dear human love , from which our Father never means us to be <unk> , but through which He <unk> us <unk> to <unk> .
She could not say , &quot; I &apos;m glad to go , &quot; for life was very sweet to her ; she could only sob out , &quot; I try to be willing , &quot; while she held fast to Jo , as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together .
By and by Beth said , with recovered <unk> , -- &quot; You &apos;ll tell them this when we go home ? &quot;
&quot; I think they will see it without words , &quot; sighed Jo ; for now it seemed to her that Beth changed every day .
&quot; Perhaps not ; I &apos;ve heard that the people who love best are often <unk> to such things .
If they don &apos;t see it , you will tell them for me .
I don &apos;t want any secrets , and it &apos;s kinder to prepare them .
Meg has John and the babies to comfort her , but you must stand by father and mother , won &apos;t you , Jo ? &quot;
&quot; If I can ; but , Beth , I don &apos;t give up yet ; I &apos;m going to believe that it _ is _ a sick fancy , and not let you think it &apos;s true , &quot; said Jo , trying to speak cheerfully .
Beth lay a minute thinking , and then said in her quiet way , -- &quot; I don &apos;t know how to express myself , and shouldn &apos;t try , to any one but you , because I can &apos;t speak out , except to my Jo .
I only mean to say that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long .
I &apos;m not like the rest of you ; I never made any plans about what I &apos;d do when I grew up ; I never thought of being married , as you all did .
I couldn &apos;t seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth , trotting about at home , of no use anywhere but there .
I never wanted to go away , and the hard part now is the leaving you all .
I &apos;m not afraid , but it seems as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven . &quot;
Jo could not speak ; and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the <unk> of the tide .
A <unk> <unk> flew by , with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast ; Beth watched it till it vanished , and her eyes were full of <unk> .
A little <unk> <unk> came <unk> over the <unk> , &quot; peeping &quot; softly to itself , as if enjoying the sun and sea ; it came quite close to Beth , looked at her with a friendly eye , and sat upon a warm stone , dressing its wet feathers , quite at home .
Beth smiled , and felt comforted , for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship , and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed .
&quot; Dear little bird !
See , Jo , how <unk> it is .
I like peeps better than the <unk> : they are not so wild and handsome , but they seem happy , confiding little things .
I used to call them my birds , last summer ; and mother said they reminded her of me , <unk> , <unk> creatures , always near the shore , and always <unk> that contented little song of theirs .
You are the <unk> , Jo , strong and wild , fond of the storm and the wind , flying far out to sea , and happy all alone .
Meg is the <unk> , and Amy is like the lark she writes about , trying to get up among the clouds , but always dropping down into its nest again .
Dear little girl !
she &apos;s so ambitious , but her heart is good and tender ; and no matter how high she <unk> , she never will forget home .
I hope I shall see her again , but she seems _ so _ far away . &quot;
&quot; She is coming in the spring , and I mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her .
I &apos;m going to have you well and rosy by that time , &quot; began Jo , feeling that of all the changes in Beth , the talking change was the greatest , for it seemed to cost no effort now , and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth .
&quot; Jo , dear , don &apos;t hope any more ; it won &apos;t do any good , I &apos;m sure of that .
We won &apos;t be miserable , but enjoy being together while we wait .
We &apos;ll have happy times , for I don &apos;t suffer much , and I think the tide will go out easily , if you help me . &quot;
Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face ; and with that silent kiss , she <unk> herself soul and body to Beth .
She was right : there was no need of any words when they got home , for father and mother saw plainly , now , what they had prayed to be saved from seeing .
<unk> with her short journey , Beth went at once to bed , saying how glad she was to be at home ; and when Jo went down , she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling Beth &apos;s secret .
Her father stood leaning his head on the mantel-piece , and did not turn as she came in ; but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help , and Jo went to comfort her without a word .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : He hurried forward to meet her &#93; <unk> .
NEW <unk> .
At three o &apos;clock in the afternoon , all the fashionable world at Nice may be seen on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , --a charming place ; for the wide walk , <unk> with <unk> , flowers , and <unk> <unk> , is <unk> on one side by the sea , on the other by the grand drive , lined with <unk> and <unk> , while beyond lie <unk> and the hills .
Many nations are represented , many languages spoken , many costumes worn ; and , on a sunny day , the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a <unk> .
<unk> English , lively French , sober Germans , handsome <unk> , ugly <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Americans , all drive , sit , or <unk> here , chatting over the news , and <unk> the latest <unk> who has arrived , <unk> or Dickens , <unk> <unk> or the Queen of the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are as <unk> as the company , and <unk> as much attention , especially the low <unk> in which ladies drive themselves , with a pair of dashing ponies , gay <unk> to keep their <unk> <unk> from <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and little grooms on the perch behind .
Along this walk , on Christmas Day , a tall young man walked slowly , with his hands behind him , and a somewhat absent expression of countenance .
He looked like an Italian , was dressed like an <unk> , and had the independent air of an American , --a <unk> which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him , and sundry <unk> in black velvet suits , with <unk> <unk> , <unk> gloves , and <unk> in their button-holes , to shrug their shoulders , and then envy him his <unk> .
There were plenty of pretty faces to admire , but the young man took little notice of them , except to glance , now and then , at some <unk> girl , or lady in blue .
Presently he strolled out of the promenade , and stood a moment at the <unk> , as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the <unk> <unk> , or to <unk> along the <unk> toward <unk> <unk> .
The quick <unk> of ponies &apos; feet made him look up , as one of the little carriages , <unk> a single lady , came rapidly down the street .
The lady was young , <unk> , and dressed in blue .
He stared a minute , then his whole face woke up , and , waving his hat like a boy , he hurried forward to meet her .
&quot; O Laurie , is it really you ?
I thought you &apos;d never come ! &quot;
cried Amy , dropping the reins , and holding out both hands , to the great <unk> of a French mamma , who <unk> her daughter &apos;s steps , lest she should be <unk> by <unk> the free manners of these &quot; mad English . &quot;
&quot; I was <unk> by the way , but I promised to spend Christmas with you , and here I am . &quot;
&quot; How is your grandfather ?
When did you come ?
Where are you <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Very <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
I called at your <unk> , but you were all out . &quot;
&quot; I have so much to say , I don &apos;t know where to begin !
Get in , and we can talk at our ease ; I was going for a drive , and longing for company .
Flo &apos;s saving up for to-night . &quot;
&quot; What happens then , a ball ? &quot;
&quot; A Christmas party at our <unk> .
There are many Americans there , and they give it in honor of the day .
You &apos;ll go with us , of course ?
Aunt will be charmed . &quot;
&quot; Thank you .
Where now ? &quot;
asked Laurie , leaning back and folding his arms , a proceeding which suited Amy , who preferred to drive ; for her <unk> and blue reins over the white ponies &apos; backs , afforded her infinite satisfaction .
&quot; I &apos;m going to the <unk> &apos;s first , for letters , and then to <unk> <unk> ; the view is so lovely , and I like to feed the peacocks .
Have you ever been there ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , years ago ; but I don &apos;t mind having a look at it . &quot;
&quot; Now tell me all about yourself .
The last I heard of you , your grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Yes , I spent a month there , and then joined him in Paris , where he has settled for the winter .
He has friends there , and finds plenty to amuse him ; so I go and come , and we get on capitally . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s a sociable arrangement , &quot; said Amy , missing something in Laurie &apos;s manner , though she couldn &apos;t tell what .
&quot; Why , you see he hates to travel , and I hate to keep still ; so we each suit ourselves , and there is no trouble .
I am often with him , and he <unk> my adventures , while I like to feel that some one is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings .
<unk> old hole , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
he added , with a look of disgust , as they drove along the <unk> to the <unk> Napoleon , in the old city .
&quot; The dirt is picturesque , so I don &apos;t mind .
The river and the hills are delicious , and these glimpses of the narrow <unk> are my delight .
Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass ; it &apos;s going to the <unk> of St.
John . &quot;
While Laurie <unk> watched the procession of <unk> under their <unk> , <unk> <unk> bearing lighted <unk> , and some <unk> in blue , chanting as they walked , Amy watched him , and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her ; for he was changed , and she could not find the <unk> boy she left in the <unk> man beside her .
He was <unk> than ever , and greatly improved , she thought ; but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over , he looked tired and <unk> , --not sick , nor exactly unhappy , but older and <unk> than a year or two of <unk> life should have made him .
She couldn &apos;t understand it , and did not venture to ask questions ; so she shook her head , and touched up her ponies , as the procession wound away across the <unk> of the <unk> bridge , and vanished in the <unk> .
&quot; _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ ? &quot;
she said , airing her French , which had improved in quantity , if not in <unk> , since she came abroad .
&quot; That mademoiselle has made good use of her time , and the result is charming , &quot; replied Laurie , <unk> , with his hand on his heart , and an admiring look .
She blushed with pleasure , but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt <unk> he used to give her at home , when he promenaded round her on festival occasions , and told her she was &quot; altogether jolly , &quot; with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head .
She didn &apos;t like the new tone ; for , though not _ <unk> � _ , it sounded indifferent in spite of the look .
&quot; If that &apos;s the way he &apos;s going to grow up , I wish he &apos;d stay a boy , &quot; she thought , with a curious sense of disappointment and <unk> , trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay .
At <unk> &apos;s she found the precious <unk> , and , giving the reins to Laurie , read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green <unk> , where <unk> bloomed as freshly as in June .
&quot; Beth is very poorly , mother says .
I often think I ought to go home , but they all say &apos; stay ; &apos; so I do , for I shall never have another chance like this , &quot; said Amy , looking sober over one page .
&quot; I think you are right , there ; you could do nothing at home , and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy , and enjoying so much , my dear . &quot;
He drew a little nearer , and looked more like his old self , as he said that ; and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy &apos;s heart was <unk> , for the look , the act , the brotherly &quot; my dear , &quot; seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come , she would not be alone in a strange land .
Presently she laughed , and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her <unk> , with the bow <unk> erect upon her cap , and issuing from her mouth the words , &quot; <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
Laurie smiled , took it , put it in his <unk> , &quot; to keep it from blowing away , &quot; and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read him .
&quot; This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me , with presents in the morning , you and letters in the afternoon , and a party at night , &quot; said Amy , as they <unk> among the ruins of the old <unk> , and a flock of splendid peacocks came <unk> about them , <unk> waiting to be fed .
While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered <unk> to the brilliant birds , Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him , with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought .
He found nothing to <unk> or disappoint , much to admire and approve ; for , <unk> a few little <unk> of speech and manner , she was as sprightly and graceful as ever , with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance .
<unk> <unk> for her age , she had <unk> a certain _ <unk> _ in both carriage and conversation , which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was ; but her old <unk> now and then showed itself , her strong will still held its own , and her native frankness was <unk> by foreign polish .
Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks , but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him , and carried away a pretty little picture of a <unk> girl standing in the sunshine , which brought out the soft <unk> of her dress , the fresh color of her cheeks , the golden <unk> of her hair , and made her a <unk> figure in the pleasant scene .
As they came up on to the stone <unk> that <unk> the hill , Amy waved her hand as if <unk> him to her favorite haunt , and said , pointing here and there , -- &quot; Do you remember the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> their <unk> in the <unk> , and the lovely road to <unk> <unk> , <unk> &apos;s <unk> , just below , and , best of all , that speck far out to sea which they say is <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; I remember ; it &apos;s not much changed , &quot; he answered , without enthusiasm .
&quot; What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck ! &quot;
said Amy , feeling in good spirits , and anxious to see him so also .
&quot; Yes , &quot; was all he said , but he turned and <unk> his eyes to see the <unk> which a greater <unk> than even Napoleon now made interesting in his sight .
&quot; Take a good look at it for her sake , and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while , &quot; said Amy , <unk> herself , ready for a good talk .
But she did not get it ; for , though he joined her , and answered all her questions freely , she could only learn that he had <unk> about the <unk> and been to <unk> .
So , after <unk> away an hour , they drove home again ; and , having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol , Laurie left them , promising to return in the evening .
It must be <unk> of Amy that she <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; that night .
Time and absence had done its work on both the young people ; she had seen her old friend in a new light , not as &quot; our boy , &quot; but as a handsome and agreeable man , and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight .
Amy knew her good points , and made the most of them , with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman .
<unk> and <unk> were cheap at Nice , so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions , and , following the sensible English fashion of simple dress for young girls , got up charming little <unk> with fresh flowers , a few <unk> , and all manner of dainty devices , which were both <unk> and effective .
It must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman , and indulged in antique _ <unk> _ , <unk> attitudes , and <unk> <unk> .
But , dear heart , we all have our little <unk> , and find it easy to pardon such in the young , who satisfy our eyes with their <unk> , and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities .
&quot; I do want him to think I look well , and tell them so at home , &quot; said Amy to herself , as she put on Flo &apos;s old white silk ball-dress , and covered it with a cloud of fresh <unk> , out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect .
Her hair she had the sense to let alone , after gathering up the thick <unk> and curls into a <unk> <unk> at the back of her head .
&quot; It &apos;s not the fashion , but it &apos;s becoming , and I can &apos;t afford to make a fright of myself , &quot; she used to say , when advised to frizzle , <unk> , or <unk> , as the latest style commanded .
Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion , Amy <unk> her <unk> skirts with rosy <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> the white shoulders in delicate green vines .
<unk> the painted boots , she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction , and _ <unk> � <unk> _ down the room , admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself .
&quot; My new fan just <unk> my flowers , my gloves fit to a charm , and the real lace on aunt &apos;s _ <unk> _ gives an air to my whole dress .
If I only had a <unk> nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy , &quot; she said , surveying herself with a <unk> eye , and a <unk> in each hand .
In spite of this affliction , she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away ; she seldom ran , --it did not suit her style , she thought , for , being tall , the stately and <unk> was more appropriate than the <unk> or <unk> .
She walked up and down the long saloon while waiting for Laurie , and once arranged herself under the <unk> , which had a good effect upon her hair ; then she thought better of it , and went away to the other end of the room , as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a <unk> one .
It so happened that she could not have done a better thing , for Laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him ; and , as she stood at the distant window , with her head half turned , and one hand gathering up her dress , the slender , white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a <unk> statue .
&quot; Good evening , <unk> ! &quot;
said Laurie , with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her .
&quot; Good evening , <unk> ! &quot;
she answered , smiling back at him , for he , too , looked unusually _ <unk> _ , and the thought of <unk> the <unk> on the arm of such a <unk> man caused Amy to pity the four plain <unk> Davis from the bottom of her heart .
&quot; Here are your flowers ; I arranged them myself , remembering that you didn &apos;t like what Hannah calls a &apos; <unk> , &apos; &quot; said Laurie , handing her a delicate <unk> , in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in <unk> &apos;s window .
&#91; Illustration : Here are your flowers &#93; &quot; How kind you are ! &quot;
she exclaimed gratefully .
&quot; If I &apos;d known you were coming I &apos;d have had something ready for you to-day , though not as pretty as this , I &apos;m afraid . &quot;
&quot; Thank you ; it isn &apos;t what it should be , but you have improved it , &quot; he added , as she <unk> the silver bracelet on her <unk> .
&quot; Please don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; I thought you liked that sort of thing ? &quot;
&quot; Not from you ; it doesn &apos;t sound natural , and I like your old <unk> better . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad of it , &quot; he answered , with a look of relief ; then <unk> her gloves for her , and asked if his tie was straight , just as he used to do when they went to parties together , at home .
The company assembled in the long _ <unk> � <unk> _ , that evening , was such as one sees <unk> but on the <unk> .
The hospitable Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice , and , having no <unk> against titles , <unk> a few to add <unk> to their Christmas ball .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> to sit in a corner for an hour , and talk with a massive lady , dressed like Hamlet &apos;s mother , in black velvet , with a pearl <unk> under her chin .
A Polish count , <unk> eighteen , devoted himself to the ladies , who pronounced him &quot; a fascinating dear , &quot; and a German <unk> Something , having come for the supper alone , roamed <unk> about , <unk> what he might <unk> .
<unk> <unk> &apos;s private <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , in tight boots , <unk> beamed upon the world , as if his master &apos;s name <unk> him with a golden <unk> ; a stout Frenchman , who knew the <unk> , came to indulge his mania for dancing , and Lady de <unk> , a British <unk> , adorned the scene with her little family of eight .
Of course , there were many <unk> , <unk> American girls , handsome , <unk> English <unk> , and a few plain but <unk> French <unk> ; likewise the usual set of travelling young gentlemen , who <unk> themselves gayly , while <unk> of all nations lined the walls , and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters .
Any young girl can imagine Amy &apos;s state of mind when she &quot; took the stage &quot; that night , leaning on Laurie &apos;s arm .
She knew she looked well , she loved to dance , she felt that her foot was on her native <unk> in a <unk> , and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty , youth , and womanhood .
She did pity the Davis girls , who were awkward , plain , and <unk> of escort , except a grim papa and three <unk> maiden aunts , and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed ; which was good of her , as it permitted them to see her dress , and burn with curiosity to know who her <unk> friend might be .
With the first burst of the band , Amy &apos;s color rose , her eyes began to <unk> , and her feet to tap the floor impatiently ; for she danced well , and wanted Laurie to know it : therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described , when he said , in a perfectly tranquil tone , -- &quot; Do you care to dance ? &quot;
&quot; One usually does at a ball . &quot;
Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to <unk> his <unk> as fast as possible .
&quot; I meant the first dance .
May I have the honor ? &quot;
&quot; I can give you one if I put off the Count .
He dances <unk> ; but he will excuse me , as you are an old friend , &quot; said Amy , hoping that the name would have a good effect , and show Laurie that she was not to be <unk> with .
&quot; Nice little boy , but rather a short <unk> to support &quot; &apos; A daughter of the gods , <unk> tall , and most <unk> fair , &apos; &quot; was all the satisfaction she got , however .
The set in which they found themselves was composed of English , and Amy was <unk> to walk <unk> through a <unk> , feeling all the while as if she could dance the <unk> with a relish .
Laurie resigned her to the &quot; nice little boy , &quot; and went to do his duty to Flo , without <unk> Amy for the joys to come , which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished , for she immediately engaged herself till supper , meaning to <unk> if he then gave any signs of <unk> .
She showed him her <unk> with <unk> satisfaction when he strolled , instead of rushing , up to claim her for the next , a glorious <unk> ; but his polite regrets didn &apos;t <unk> upon her , and when she <unk> away with the Count , she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with an <unk> expression of relief .
That was <unk> ; and Amy took no more notice of him for a long while , except a word now and then , when she came to her <unk> , between the dances , for a necessary pin or a moment &apos;s rest .
Her anger had a good effect , however , for she hid it under a smiling face , and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant .
Laurie &apos;s eyes followed her with pleasure , for she neither <unk> nor <unk> , but danced with spirit and grace , making the <unk> <unk> what it should be .
He very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view ; and , before the evening was half over , had decided that &quot; little Amy was going to make a very charming woman . &quot;
It was a lively scene , for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of every one , and Christmas merriment made all faces shine , hearts happy , and heels light .
The <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> as if they enjoyed it ; everybody danced who could , and those who couldn &apos;t admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth .
The air was dark with <unk> , and many <unk> <unk> like a flock of young <unk> .
The golden <unk> darted through the room like a <unk> , with a dashing Frenchwoman , who <unk> the floor with her pink satin train .
The <unk> <unk> found the <unk> , and was happy , eating steadily through the bill of fare , and <unk> the _ <unk> � <unk> _ by the <unk> he <unk> .
But the <unk> &apos;s friend covered himself with glory , for he danced everything , whether he knew it or not , and introduced impromptu <unk> when the figures bewildered him .
The boyish <unk> of that stout man was charming to behold ; for , though he &quot; carried weight , &quot; he danced like an <unk> ball .
He ran , he flew , he pranced ; his face glowed , his <unk> head shone ; his <unk> waved wildly , his <unk> actually twinkled in the air , and when the music stopped , he wiped the drops from his brow , and beamed upon his <unk> like a French Pickwick without glasses .
Amy and her <unk> <unk> themselves by equal enthusiasm , but more graceful <unk> ; and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the <unk> rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as <unk> as if <unk> .
When little <unk> finally <unk> her , with assurances that he was &quot; <unk> to leave so early , &quot; she was ready to rest , and see how her <unk> knight had borne his punishment .
It had been successful ; for , at <unk> , blighted affections find a balm in friendly society , and young <unk> will thrill , young blood dance , and healthy young spirits rise , when <unk> to the <unk> of beauty , light , music , and motion .
Laurie had a <unk> look as he rose to give her his seat ; and when he hurried away to bring her some supper , she said to herself , with a satisfied smile , -- &quot; Ah , I thought that would do him good ! &quot;
&quot; You look like <unk> &apos;s &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &apos; &quot; he said , as he <unk> her with one hand , and held her <unk> in the other .
&quot; My <unk> won &apos;t come off ; &quot; and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek , and showed him her white glove with a sober <unk> that made him laugh outright .
&quot; What do you call this stuff ? &quot;
he asked , touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee .
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Good name for it ; it &apos;s very <unk> thing , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s as old as the hills ; you have seen it on <unk> of girls , and you never found out that it was pretty till <unk> _ <unk> _ ! &quot;
&quot; I never saw it on you before , which accounts for the mistake , you see . &quot;
&quot; None of that , it is forbidden ; I &apos;d rather take coffee than compliments just now .
No , don &apos;t <unk> , it makes me nervous . &quot;
Laurie sat <unk> <unk> , and meekly took her empty plate , feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having &quot; little Amy &quot; order him about ; for she had lost her shyness now , and felt an irresistible desire to <unk> on him , as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of <unk> .
&quot; Where did you learn all this sort of thing ? &quot;
he asked , with a <unk> look .
&quot; As &apos; this sort of thing &apos; is rather a vague expression , would you kindly explain ? &quot;
returned Amy , knowing perfectly well what he meant , but <unk> leaving him to describe what is indescribable .
&quot; <unk> general air , the style , the <unk> , <unk> know , &quot; laughed Laurie , breaking down , and helping himself out of his <unk> with the new word .
Amy was gratified , but , of course , didn &apos;t show it , and <unk> answered , &quot; <unk> life <unk> one in spite of one &apos;s self ; I study as well as play ; and as for this &quot; --with a little gesture toward her <unk> &quot; why , <unk> is cheap , <unk> to be had for nothing , and I am used to making the most of my poor little things . &quot;
Amy rather regretted that last sentence , fearing it wasn &apos;t in good taste ; but Laurie liked her the better for it , and found himself both admiring and <unk> the brave patience that made the most of opportunity , and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers .
Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly , nor why he filled up her book with his own name , and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening , in the most delightful manner ; but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new <unk> which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving .
&#91; Illustration : Demi and Daisy &#93; <unk> .
<unk> THE <unk> .
In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married , when &quot; _ <unk> la <unk> � _ &quot; becomes their motto .
In America , as every one knows , girls early sign the <unk> of independence , and enjoy their freedom with <unk> <unk> ; but the young matrons usually <unk> with the first <unk> to the <unk> , and go into a <unk> almost as close as a French <unk> , though by no means as quiet .
Whether they like it or not , they are <unk> put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over , and most of them might exclaim , as did a very pretty woman the other day , &quot; I &apos;m as handsome as ever , but no one takes any notice of me because I &apos;m married . &quot;
Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady , Meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old , for in her little world <unk> <unk> prevailed , and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever .
As she was a womanly little woman , the maternal instinct was very strong , and she was entirely absorbed in her children , to the utter <unk> of everything and everybody else .
Day and night she <unk> over them with <unk> devotion and anxiety , leaving John to the tender <unk> of the help , for an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen <unk> .
Being a domestic man , John decidedly missed the <unk> attentions he had been accustomed to receive ; but , as he adored his babies , he cheerfully <unk> his comfort for a time , <unk> , with masculine <unk> , that peace would soon be <unk> .
But three months passed , and there was no return of repose ; Meg looked worn and nervous , the babies absorbed every minute of her time , the house was neglected , and Kitty , the cook , who took life &quot; <unk> , &quot; kept him on short <unk> .
When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small <unk> for the captive mamma ; if he came gayly in at night , eager to embrace his family , he was quenched by a &quot; Hush !
they are just asleep after worrying all day . &quot;
If he proposed a little amusement at home , &quot; No , it would disturb the babies . &quot;
If he hinted at a lecture or <unk> , he was answered with a reproachful look , and a decided &quot; Leave my children for pleasure , never ! &quot;
His sleep was broken by infant <unk> and visions of a <unk> figure <unk> noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night ; his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the <unk> genius , who deserted him , <unk> , if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above ; and when he read his paper of an evening , Demi &apos;s <unk> got into the <unk> , and Daisy &apos;s fall affected the price of <unk> , for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news .
The poor man was very uncomfortable , for the children had <unk> him of his wife ; home was merely a nursery , and the perpetual &quot; <unk> &quot; made him feel like a <unk> <unk> whenever he entered the sacred <unk> of <unk> .
He bore it very patiently for six months , and , when no signs of <unk> appeared , he did what other paternal <unk> do , <unk> to get a little comfort elsewhere .
Scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off , and John fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening , when his own parlor was empty , and his own wife singing <unk> that seemed to have no end .
Mrs. Scott was a lively , pretty girl , with nothing to do but be agreeable , and she performed her mission most <unk> .
The parlor was always bright and attractive , the <unk> ready , the piano in tune , plenty of gay gossip , and a nice little supper set forth in <unk> style .
John would have preferred his own <unk> if it had not been so lonely ; but as it was , he gratefully took the next best thing , and enjoyed his neighbor &apos;s society .
Meg rather <unk> of the new arrangement at first , and found it a relief to know that John was having a good time instead of <unk> in the parlor , or tramping about the house and waking the children .
But by and by , when the <unk> worry was over , and the <unk> went to sleep at proper hours , leaving mamma time to rest , she began to miss John , and find her work-basket dull company , when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing-gown , comfortably <unk> his slippers on the <unk> .
She would not ask him to stay at home , but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told , entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain .
She was nervous and worn out with watching and worry , and in that <unk> frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares <unk> them .
Want of exercise <unk> them of cheerfulness , and too much devotion to that idol of American women , the teapot , makes them feel as if they were all <unk> and no <unk> .
&quot; Yes , &quot; she would say , looking in the glass , &quot; I &apos;m getting old and ugly ; John doesn &apos;t find me interesting any longer , so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor , who has no <unk> .
Well , the babies love me ; they don &apos;t care if I am thin and pale , and haven &apos;t time to <unk> my hair ; they are my comfort , and some day John will see what I &apos;ve gladly sacrificed for them , won &apos;t he , my precious ? &quot;
To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a <unk> , or Demi with a crow , and Meg would put by her <unk> for a maternal revel , which soothed her solitude for the time being .
But the pain increased as politics absorbed John , who was always running over to <unk> interesting points with Scott , quite unconscious that Meg missed him .
Not a word did she say , however , till her mother found her in tears one day , and insisted on knowing what the matter was , for Meg &apos;s <unk> spirits had not escaped her observation .
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t tell any one except you , mother ; but I really do need advice , for , if John goes on so much longer I might as well be <unk> , &quot; replied Mrs. Brooke , drying her tears on Daisy &apos;s bib , with an injured air .
&quot; <unk> on how , my dear ? &quot;
asked her mother anxiously .
&quot; He &apos;s away all day , and at night , when I want to see him , he is continually going over to the <unk> &apos; .
It isn &apos;t fair that I should have the <unk> work , and never any amusement .
Men are very selfish , even the best of them . &quot;
&quot; So are women ; don &apos;t blame John till you see where you are wrong yourself . &quot;
&quot; But it can &apos;t be right for him to neglect me . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you neglect him ? &quot;
&quot; Why , mother , I thought you &apos;d take my part ! &quot;
&quot; So I do , as far as <unk> goes ; but I think the fault is yours , Meg . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see how . &quot;
&quot; Let me show you .
Did John ever neglect you , as you call it , while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening , his only leisure time ? &quot;
&quot; No ; but I can &apos;t do it now , with two babies to <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I think you could , dear ; and I think you ought .
May I speak quite freely , and will you remember that it &apos;s mother who <unk> as well as mother who <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Indeed I will !
<unk> to me as if I were little Meg again .
I often feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything . &quot;
Meg drew her low chair beside her mother &apos;s , and , with a little <unk> in either lap , the two women rocked and talked <unk> together , feeling that the tie of <unk> made them more one than ever .
&quot; You have only made the mistake that most young wives make , <unk> your duty to your husband in your love for your children .
A very natural and <unk> mistake , Meg , but one that had better be <unk> before you take to different ways ; for children should draw you nearer than ever , not separate you , as if they were all yours , and John had nothing to do but support them .
I &apos;ve seen it for some weeks , but have not spoken , feeling sure it would come right in time . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid it won &apos;t .
If I ask him to stay , he &apos;ll think I &apos;m jealous ; and I wouldn &apos;t insult him by such an idea .
He doesn &apos;t see that I want him , and I don &apos;t know how to tell him without words . &quot;
&quot; Make it so pleasant he won &apos;t want to go away .
My dear , he &apos;s longing for his little home ; but it isn &apos;t home without you , and you are always in the nursery . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;t I to be there ? &quot;
&quot; Not all the time ; too much confinement makes you nervous , and then you are <unk> for everything .
Besides , you owe something to John as well as to the babies ; don &apos;t neglect husband for children , don &apos;t shut him out of the nursery , but teach him how to help in it .
His place is there as well as yours , and the children need him ; let him feel that he has his part to do , and he will do it gladly and faithfully , and it will be better for you all . &quot;
&quot; You really think so , mother ? &quot;
&quot; I know it , Meg , for I &apos;ve tried it ; and I seldom give advice unless I &apos;ve proved its <unk> .
When you and Jo were little , I went on just as you are , feeling as if I didn &apos;t do my duty unless I devoted myself <unk> to you .
Poor father took to his books , after I had refused all offers of help , and left me to try my experiment alone .
I <unk> along as well as I could , but Jo was too much for me .
I nearly spoilt her by indulgence .
You were poorly , and I worried about you till I fell sick myself .
Then father came to the rescue , quietly managed everything , and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake , and never have been able to get on without him since .
That is the secret of our home happiness : he does not let business <unk> him from the little cares and duties that affect us all , and I try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his <unk> .
Each do our part alone in many things , but at home we work together , always . &quot;
&quot; It is so , mother ; and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours .
<unk> me how ; I &apos;ll do anything you say . &quot;
&quot; You always were my docile daughter .
Well , dear , if I were you , I &apos;d let John have more to do with the management of Demi , for the boy needs training , and it &apos;s none too soon to begin .
Then I &apos;d do what I have often proposed , let Hannah come and help you ; she is a capital nurse , and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more <unk> .
You need the exercise , Hannah would enjoy the rest , and John would find his wife again .
Go out more ; keep cheerful as well as busy , for you are the <unk> of the family , and if you get dismal there is no fair weather .
Then I &apos;d try to take an interest in whatever John likes , <unk> with him , let him read to you , <unk> ideas , and help each other in that way .
Don &apos;t shut yourself up in a <unk> because you are a woman , but understand what is going on , and <unk> yourself to take your part in the world &apos;s work , for it all <unk> you and yours . &quot;
&quot; John is so sensible , I &apos;m afraid he will think I &apos;m stupid if I ask questions about politics and things . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t believe he would ; love <unk> a <unk> of sins , and of whom could you ask more freely than of him ?
Try it , and see if he doesn &apos;t find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I will .
Poor John !
I &apos;m afraid I _ have _ neglected him sadly , but I thought I was right , and he never said anything . &quot;
&quot; He tried not to be selfish , but he _ has _ felt rather forlorn , I fancy .
This is just the time , Meg , when young married people are apt to grow apart , and the very time when they ought to be most together ; for the first tenderness soon wears off , unless care is taken to preserve it ; and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given them to train .
Don &apos;t let John be a stranger to the babies , for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else , and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should .
Now , dear , good-by ; think over mother &apos;s <unk> , act upon it if it seems good , and God bless you all ! &quot;
Meg did think it over , found it good , and acted upon it , though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it .
Of course the children tyrannized over her , and <unk> the house as soon as they found out that <unk> and <unk> brought them whatever they wanted .
Mamma was an abject slave to their <unk> , but papa was not so easily <unk> , and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal <unk> with his <unk> son .
For Demi <unk> a trifle of his sire &apos;s <unk> of character , <unk> won &apos;t call it obstinacy , --and when he made up his little mind to have or to do anything , all the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men could not change that <unk> little mind .
Mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his <unk> , but papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience ; so <unk> Demi early discovered that when he undertook to &quot; <unk> &quot; with &quot; <unk> , &quot; he always got the worst of it ; yet , like the <unk> , <unk> respected the man who conquered him , and loved the father whose grave &quot; No , no , &quot; was more impressive than all mamma &apos;s <unk> .
A few days after the talk with her mother , Meg resolved to try a social evening with John ; so she ordered a nice supper , set the parlor in order , dressed herself prettily , and put the children to bed early , that nothing should interfere with her experiment .
But , unfortunately , Demi &apos;s most <unk> <unk> was against going to bed , and that night he decided to go on a <unk> ; so poor Meg sung and rocked , told stories and tried every <unk> <unk> she could <unk> , but all in vain , the big eyes wouldn &apos;t shut ; and long after Daisy had gone to <unk> , like the <unk> little bunch of <unk> she was , naughty Demi lay staring at the light , with the most <unk> wide-awake expression of countenance .
&quot; Will Demi lie still like a good boy , while mamma runs down and gives poor papa his tea ? &quot;
asked Meg , as the <unk> softly closed , and the well-known step went <unk> into the dining-room .
&quot; Me has tea ! &quot;
said Demi , preparing to join in the revel .
&quot; No ; but I &apos;ll save you some little <unk> for breakfast , if you &apos;ll go <unk> like Daisy .
Will you , <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
and Demi shut his eyes tight , as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day .
Taking advantage of the <unk> moment , Meg slipped away , and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face , and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration .
He saw it at once , and said , with pleased surprise , -- &quot; Why , little mother , how gay we are to-night .
Do you expect company ? &quot;
&quot; Only you , dear . &quot;
&quot; Is it a birthday , <unk> , or anything ? &quot;
&quot; No ; I &apos;m tired of being a dowdy , so I dressed up as a change .
You always make yourself nice for table , no matter how tired you are ; so why shouldn &apos;t I when I have the time ? &quot;
&quot; I do it out of respect to you , my dear , &quot; said old-fashioned John .
&quot; <unk> , <unk> , Mr. Brooke , &quot; laughed Meg , looking young and pretty again , as she nodded to him over the teapot .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s altogether delightful , and like old times .
This tastes right .
I drink your health , dear . &quot;
And John <unk> his tea with an air of <unk> rapture , which was of very short <unk> , however ; for , as he put down his cup , the <unk> <unk> mysteriously , and a little voice was heard , saying impatiently , -- &quot; <unk> <unk> ; me &apos;s <unk> ! &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s that naughty boy .
I told him to go to sleep alone , and here he is , downstairs , getting his death <unk> <unk> over that <unk> , &quot; said Meg , <unk> the call .
&#91; Illustration : Mornin &apos; now &#93; &quot; Mornin &apos; now , &quot; announced Demi , in a joyful tone , as he entered , with his long <unk> gracefully <unk> over his arm , and every curl <unk> gayly as he pranced about the table , eying the &quot; <unk> &quot; with loving glances .
&quot; No , it isn &apos;t morning yet .
You must go to bed , and not trouble poor mamma ; then you can have the little cake with sugar on it . &quot;
&quot; Me loves <unk> , &quot; said the artful one , preparing to climb the paternal knee , and revel in forbidden joys .
But John shook his head , and said to Meg , -- &quot; If you told him to stay up there , and go to sleep alone , make him do it , or he will never learn to mind you . &quot;
&quot; Yes , of course .
Come , Demi ; &quot; and Meg led her son away , feeling a strong desire to <unk> the little <unk> who <unk> beside her , laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery .
Nor was he disappointed ; for that short-sighted woman actually gave him a <unk> of sugar , tucked him into his bed , and forbade any more promenades till morning .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
said Demi the <unk> , <unk> <unk> his sugar , and regarding his first attempt as <unk> successful .
Meg returned to her place , and supper was <unk> pleasantly , when the little ghost walked again , and <unk> the maternal <unk> by boldly demanding , -- &quot; More <unk> , marmar . &quot;
&quot; Now this won &apos;t do , &quot; said John , <unk> his heart against the engaging little sinner .
&quot; We shall never know any peace till that child <unk> to go to bed properly .
You have made a slave of yourself long enough ; give him one lesson , and then there will be an end of it .
Put him in his bed and leave him , Meg . &quot;
&quot; He won &apos;t stay there ; he never does , unless I sit by him . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll manage him .
Demi , go upstairs , and get into your bed , as mamma <unk> you . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
replied the young rebel , helping himself to the coveted &quot; <unk> , &quot; and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity .
&quot; You must never say that to papa ; I shall carry you if you don &apos;t go yourself . &quot;
&quot; Go &apos; way ; me don &apos;t love <unk> ; &quot; and Demi retired to his mother &apos;s skirts for protection .
But even that refuge proved <unk> , for he was delivered over to the enemy , with a &quot; Be gentle with him , John , &quot; which struck the culprit with dismay ; for when mamma deserted him , then the <unk> was at hand .
<unk> of his cake , <unk> of his frolic , and borne away by a strong hand to that <unk> bed , poor Demi could not restrain his wrath , but <unk> defied papa , and <unk> and screamed <unk> all the way upstairs .
The minute he was put into bed on one side , he rolled out on the other , and made for the door , only to be <unk> caught up by the tail of his little <unk> , and put back again , which lively performance was kept up till the young man &apos;s strength gave out , when he devoted himself to <unk> at the top of his voice .
This <unk> exercise usually conquered Meg ; but John sat as <unk> as the post which is <unk> believed to be deaf .
No <unk> , no sugar , no <unk> , no story ; even the light was put out , and only the red glow of the fire <unk> the &quot; big dark &quot; which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear .
This new order of things disgusted him , and he <unk> dismally for &quot; marmar , &quot; as his angry passions subsided , and <unk> of his tender <unk> returned to the captive <unk> .
The plaintive <unk> which succeeded the passionate <unk> went to Meg &apos;s heart , and she ran up to say <unk> , -- &quot; Let me stay with him ; he &apos;ll be good , now , John . &quot;
&quot; No , my dear , I &apos;ve told him he must go to sleep , as you bid him ; and he must , if I stay here all night . &quot;
&quot; But he &apos;ll cry himself sick , &quot; pleaded Meg , <unk> herself for <unk> her boy .
&quot; No , he won &apos;t , he &apos;s so tired he will soon drop off , and then the matter is settled ; for he will understand that he has got to mind .
Don &apos;t interfere ; I &apos;ll manage him . &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s my child , and I can &apos;t have his spirit broken by <unk> . &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s my child , and I won &apos;t have his temper spoilt by indulgence .
Go down , my dear , and leave the boy to me . &quot;
When John spoke in that <unk> tone , Meg always obeyed , and never regretted her <unk> .
&quot; Please let me kiss him once , John ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> .
Demi , say &apos; good-night &apos; to mamma , and let her go and rest , for she is very tired with taking care of you all day . &quot;
Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the <unk> ; for after it was given , Demi sobbed more quietly , and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed , whither he had <unk> in his anguish of mind .
&quot; Poor little man , he &apos;s worn out with sleep and crying .
I &apos;ll cover him up , and then go and set Meg &apos;s heart at rest , &quot; thought John , <unk> to the bedside , hoping to find his rebellious <unk> asleep .
But he wasn &apos;t ; for the moment his father peeped at him , Demi &apos;s eyes opened , his little chin began to quiver , and he put up his arms , saying , with a penitent <unk> , &quot; Me &apos;s <unk> , now . &quot;
Sitting on the stairs , outside , Meg wondered at the long silence which followed the <unk> ; and , after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents , she slipped into the room , to set her fears at rest .
Demi lay fast asleep ; not in his usual <unk> attitude , but in a subdued bunch , cuddled close in the circle of his father &apos;s arm and holding his father &apos;s finger , as if he felt that justice was <unk> with mercy , and had gone to sleep a <unk> and a wiser baby .
So held , John had waited with womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold ; and , while waiting , had fallen asleep , more tired by that <unk> with his son than with his whole day &apos;s work .
As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow , she smiled to herself , and then slipped away again , saying , in a satisfied tone , -- &quot; I never need fear that John will be too <unk> with my babies : he _ does _ know how to manage them , and will be a great help , for Demi _ is _ getting too much for me . &quot;
When John came down at last , expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife , he was <unk> surprised to find Meg <unk> trimming a bonnet , and to be greeted with the request to read something about the <unk> , if he was not too tired .
John saw in a minute that a <unk> of some kind was going on , but wisely asked no questions , knowing that Meg was such a <unk> little person , she couldn &apos;t keep a secret to save her life , and therefore the <unk> would soon appear .
He read a long <unk> with the most amiable <unk> , and then explained it in his most <unk> manner , while Meg tried to look deeply interested , to ask intelligent questions , and keep her thoughts from <unk> from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet .
In her secret soul , however , she decided that politics were as bad as <unk> , and that the mission of <unk> seemed to be calling each other names ; but she kept these feminine ideas to herself , and when John paused , shook her head , and said with what she thought <unk> <unk> , -- &quot; Well , I really don &apos;t see what we are coming to . &quot;
John laughed , and watched her for a minute , as she <unk> a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand , and regarded it with the genuine interest which his <unk> had failed to <unk> .
&quot; She is trying to like politics for my sake , so I &apos;ll try and like <unk> for hers , that &apos;s only fair , &quot; thought John the Just , adding aloud , -- &quot; That &apos;s very pretty ; is it what you call a <unk> ? &quot;
&#91; Illustration : My dear man , it &apos;s a bonnet &#93; &quot; My dear man , it &apos;s a bonnet !
My very best <unk> bonnet . &quot;
&quot; I beg your pardon ; it was so small , I naturally <unk> it for one of the fly-away things you sometimes wear .
How do you keep it on ? &quot;
&quot; These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a <unk> , so ; &quot; and Meg <unk> by putting on the bonnet , and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible .
&quot; It &apos;s a love of a bonnet , but I prefer the face inside , for it looks young and happy again , &quot; and John kissed the smiling face , to the great <unk> of the <unk> under the chin .
&quot; I &apos;m glad you like it , for I want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night ; I really need some music to put me in tune .
Will you , please ? &quot;
&quot; Of course I will , with all my heart , or anywhere else you like .
You have been shut up so long , it will do you no end of good , and I shall enjoy it , of all things .
What put it into your head , little mother ? &quot;
&quot; Well , I had a talk with Marmee the other day , and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts I felt , and she said I needed change and less care ; so Hannah is to help me with the children , and I &apos;m to see to things about the house more , and now and then have a little fun , just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety , <unk> old woman before my time .
It &apos;s only an experiment , John , and I want to try it for your sake as much as for mine , because I &apos;ve neglected you <unk> lately , and I &apos;m going to make home what it used to be , if I can .
You don &apos;t object , I hope ? &quot;
Never mind what John said , or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin ; all that we have any business to know , is that John did _ not _ appear to object , judging from the changes which gradually took place in the house and its <unk> .
It was not all <unk> by any means , but every one was better for the <unk> of labor <unk> ; the children <unk> under the paternal rule , for <unk> , <unk> John brought order and obedience into <unk> , while Meg recovered her spirits and composed her <unk> by plenty of wholesome exercise , a little pleasure , and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband .
Home grew <unk> again , and John had no wish to leave it , unless he took Meg with him .
The <unk> came to the <unk> &apos; now , and every one found the little house a cheerful place , full of happiness , content , and family love .
Even gay Sallie <unk> liked to go there .
&quot; It is always so quiet and pleasant here ; it does me good , Meg , &quot; she used to say , looking about her with wistful eyes , as if trying to discover the charm , that she might use it in her great house , full of splendid loneliness ; for there were no riotous , <unk> babies there , and Ned lived in a world of his own , where there was no place for her .
This household happiness did not come all at once , but John and Meg had found the key to it , and each year of married life taught them how to use it , <unk> the <unk> of real <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which the <unk> may possess , and the <unk> cannot buy .
This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid , safe from the restless fret and fever of the world , finding <unk> lovers in the little <unk> and daughters who cling to them , <unk> by sorrow , poverty , or age ; walking side by side , through fair and stormy weather , with a faithful friend , who is , in the true sense of the good old <unk> word , the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and learning , as Meg learned , that a woman &apos;s happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor the art of <unk> it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother .

<unk> LAURENCE .
Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week , and remained a month .
He was tired of <unk> about alone , and Amy &apos;s familiar presence seemed to give a <unk> charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part .
He rather missed the &quot; petting &quot; he used to receive , and enjoyed a taste of it again ; for no attentions , however flattering , from strangers , were half so pleasant as the sisterly <unk> of the girls at home .
Amy never would pet him like the others , but she was very glad to see him now , and quite clung to him , feeling that he was the <unk> of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess .
They naturally took comfort in each other &apos;s society , and were much together , riding , walking , dancing , or <unk> , for , at Nice , no one can be very <unk> during the gay season .
But , while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion , they were <unk> making discoveries and <unk> <unk> about each other .
Amy rose daily in the <unk> of her friend , but he <unk> in hers , and each felt the truth before a word was spoken .
Amy tried to please , and succeeded , for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her , and <unk> him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm .
Laurie made no effort of any kind , but just let himself <unk> along as comfortably as possible , trying to forget , and feeling that all women <unk> him a kind word because one had been cold to him .
It cost him no effort to be generous , and he would have given Amy all the <unk> in Nice if she would have taken them ; but , at the same time , he felt that he could not change the opinion she was <unk> of him , and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such <unk> , <unk> surprise .
&quot; All the rest have gone to <unk> for the day ; I preferred to stay at home and write letters .
They are done now , and I am going to Valrosa to sketch ; will you come ? &quot;
said Amy , as she joined Laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual , about <unk> .
&quot; Well , yes ; but isn &apos;t it rather warm for such a long walk ? &quot;
he answered slowly , for the <unk> _ salon _ looked inviting , after the <unk> without .
&quot; I &apos;m going to have the little carriage , and <unk> can drive , so you &apos;ll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves nice , &quot; returned Amy , with a <unk> glance at the <unk> <unk> , which were a weak point with Laurie .
&quot; Then I &apos;ll go with pleasure ; &quot; and he put out his hand for her sketch-book .
But she tucked it under her arm with a <unk> &quot; Don &apos;t trouble yourself ; it &apos;s no <unk> to me , but _ you _ don &apos;t look equal to it . &quot;
Laurie lifted his eyebrows , and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs ; but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself , and left little <unk> nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch .
The two never <unk> , <unk> was too well-bred , and just now Laurie was too lazy ; so , in a minute he peeped under her <unk> with an inquiring air ; she answered with a smile , and they went on together in the most <unk> manner .
It was a lovely drive , along <unk> <unk> rich in the picturesque scenes that delight <unk> eyes .
Here an ancient <unk> , <unk> the solemn chanting of the <unk> came down to them .
There a <unk> <unk> , in wooden shoes , pointed hat , and rough <unk> over one shoulder , sat piping on a stone , while his goats skipped among the <unk> or lay at his feet .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> of <unk> grass , passed by , with a pretty girl in a _ <unk> _ sitting between the green piles , or an old woman spinning with a <unk> as she went .
Brown , <unk> children ran out from the quaint stone <unk> to offer <unk> , or <unk> of <unk> still on the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> covered the hills with their <unk> <unk> , fruit hung golden in the orchard , and great scarlet <unk> <unk> the <unk> ; while beyond green <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky .
Valrosa well deserved its name , for , in that <unk> of perpetual summer , roses blossomed everywhere .
They <unk> the <unk> , <unk> themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to <unk> , and lined the <unk> , <unk> through <unk> and <unk> <unk> up to the <unk> on the hill .
Every <unk> <unk> , where seats invited one to stop and rest , was a <unk> of bloom ; every cool <unk> had its marble <unk> smiling from a veil of flowers , and every fountain reflected crimson , white , or pale pink roses , leaning down to smile at their own beauty .
<unk> covered the walls of the house , draped the <unk> , climbed the <unk> , and ran <unk> over the <unk> of the wide terrace , <unk> one looked down on the sunny <unk> , and the <unk> city on its shore .
&quot; This is a regular honeymoon <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
Did you ever see such roses ? &quot;
asked Amy , pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view , and a luxurious <unk> of <unk> that came <unk> by .
&quot; No , nor felt such thorns , &quot; returned Laurie , with his <unk> in his mouth , after a vain attempt to <unk> a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach .
&quot; Try lower down , and pick those that have no thorns , &quot; said Amy , gathering three of the tiny <unk> ones that <unk> the wall behind her .
She put them in his button-hole , as a <unk> , and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression , for in the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of <unk> , and he was just then in that state of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , when <unk> young men find <unk> in trifles , and food for romance everywhere .
He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny red rose , for <unk> flowers became her , and she had often worn ones like that from the <unk> at home .
The pale roses Amy gave him were the sort that the <unk> lay in dead hands , never in bridal <unk> , and , for a moment , he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself ; but the next instant his American <unk> got the better of <unk> , and he laughed a <unk> laugh than Amy had heard since he came .
&quot; It &apos;s good advice ; you &apos;d better take it and save your fingers , &quot; she said , thinking her speech amused him .
&quot; Thank you , I will , &quot; he answered in <unk> , and a few months later he did it in earnest .
&quot; Laurie , when are you going to your grandfather ? &quot;
she asked presently , as she settled herself on a <unk> seat .
&quot; Very soon . &quot;
&quot; You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks . &quot;
&quot; I dare say ; short answers save trouble . &quot;
&quot; He <unk> you , and you really ought to go . &quot;
&quot; <unk> creature !
I know it . &quot;
&quot; Then why don &apos;t you do it ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> , I suppose . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> , you mean .
It &apos;s really dreadful ! &quot;
and Amy looked severe .
&quot; Not so bad as it seems , for I should only plague him if I went , so I might as well stay , and plague you a little longer , you can bear it better ; in fact , I think it <unk> with you excellently ; &quot; and Laurie composed himself for a <unk> on the broad <unk> of the <unk> .
Amy shook her head , and opened her sketch-book with an air of resignation ; but she had made up her mind to lecture &quot; that boy , &quot; and in a minute she began again .
&quot; What are you doing just now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; No , no ; I mean what do you intend and wish to do ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> a <unk> , if you &apos;ll allow me . &quot;
&quot; How provoking you are !
I don &apos;t approve of <unk> , and I will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch ; I need a figure . &quot;
&quot; With all the pleasure in life .
How will you have me , <unk> or <unk> , on my head or my heels ?
I should respectfully suggest a <unk> <unk> , then put yourself in also , and call it &apos; _ <unk> far <unk> . _ &apos; &quot; &quot; <unk> as you are , and go to sleep if you like .
_ I _ intend to work hard , &quot; said Amy , in her most energetic tone .
&quot; What delightful enthusiasm ! &quot;
and he leaned against a tall <unk> with an air of entire satisfaction .
&quot; What would Jo say if she saw you now ? &quot;
asked Amy impatiently , hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister &apos;s name .
&quot; As usual , &apos; Go away , Teddy , I &apos;m busy ! &apos; &quot;
He laughed as he spoke , but the laugh was not natural , and a shade passed over his face , for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not <unk> yet .
Both tone and shadow struck Amy , for she had seen and heard them before , and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on Laurie &apos;s face , --a hard , bitter look , full of pain , <unk> , and regret .
It was gone before she could study it , and the listless expression back again .
She watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure , thinking how like an Italian he looked , as he lay <unk> in the sun with <unk> head , and eyes full of <unk> <unk> ; for he seemed to have forgotten her , and fallen into a reverie .
&quot; You look like the <unk> of a young knight asleep on his tomb , &quot; she said , carefully <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> against the dark stone .
&quot; Wish I was ! &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s a foolish wish , unless you have spoilt your life .
You are so changed , I sometimes <unk> &quot; there Amy stopped , with a <unk> , <unk> look , more <unk> than her unfinished speech .
Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she <unk> to express , and looking straight into her eyes , said , just as he used to say it to her mother , -- &quot; It &apos;s all right , ma &apos;am . &quot;
That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately .
It also touched her , and she showed that it did , by the cordial tone in which she said , -- &quot; I &apos;m glad of that !
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d been a very bad boy , but I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked <unk> , lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband , or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour .
Don &apos;t stay out there in the sun ; come and lie on the grass here , and &apos; let us be friendly , &apos; as Jo used to say when we got in the <unk> and told secrets . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Laurie threw himself down on the turf &#93; Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf , and began to amuse himself by <unk> <unk> into the ribbons of Amy &apos;s hat , that lay there .
&quot; I &apos;m all ready for the secrets ; &quot; and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes .
&quot; I &apos;ve none to tell ; you may begin . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;t one to bless myself with .
I thought perhaps you &apos;d had some news from home . &quot;
&quot; You have heard all that has come lately .
Don &apos;t you hear often ?
I fancied Jo would send you volumes . &quot;
&quot; She &apos;s very busy ; I &apos;m <unk> about so , it &apos;s impossible to be regular , you know .
When do you begin your great work of art , <unk> ? &quot;
he asked , changing the subject abruptly after another pause , in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his secret , and wanted to talk about it .
&quot; Never , &quot; she answered , with a despondent but decided air .
&quot; Rome took all the vanity out of me ; for after seeing the <unk> there , I felt too <unk> to live , and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair . &quot;
&quot; Why should you , with so much energy and talent ? &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s just why , <unk> talent isn &apos;t genius , and no amount of energy can make it so .
I want to be great , or nothing .
I won &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> , so I don &apos;t intend to try any more . &quot;
&quot; And what are you going to do with yourself now , if I may ask ? &quot;
&quot; Polish up my other <unk> , and be an ornament to society , if I get the chance . &quot;
It was a characteristic speech , and sounded daring ; but audacity becomes young people , and Amy &apos;s ambition had a good <unk> .
Laurie smiled , but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a <unk> one died , and spent no time <unk> .
&quot; Good !
and here is where Fred Vaughn comes in , I fancy . &quot;
Amy <unk> a <unk> silence , but there was a conscious look in her downcast face , that made Laurie sit up and say gravely , -- &quot; Now I &apos;m going to play brother , and ask questions .
May I ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t promise to answer . &quot;
&quot; Your face will , if your tongue won &apos;t .
You aren &apos;t woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings , my dear .
I heard <unk> about Fred and you last year , and it &apos;s my private opinion that , if he had not been called home so suddenly and <unk> so long , something would have come of <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s not for me to say , &quot; was Amy &apos;s prim reply ; but her lips would smile , and there was a <unk> <unk> of the eye , which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge .
&quot; You are not engaged , I hope ? &quot;
and Laurie looked very <unk> and grave all of a sudden .
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; But you will be , if he comes back and goes properly down upon his knees , won &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Very likely . &quot;
&quot; Then you are fond of old Fred ? &quot;
&quot; I could be , if I tried . &quot;
&quot; But you don &apos;t intend to try till the proper moment ?
Bless my soul , what <unk> <unk> !
He &apos;s a good fellow , Amy , but not the man I fancied you &apos;d like . &quot;
&quot; He is rich , a gentleman , and has delightful manners , &quot; began Amy , trying to be quite cool and dignified , but feeling a little ashamed of herself , in spite of the <unk> of her intentions .
&quot; I understand ; <unk> of society can &apos;t get on without money , so you mean to make a good match , and start in that way ?
Quite right and proper , as the world goes , but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother &apos;s girls . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , nevertheless . &quot;
A short speech , but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young <unk> .
Laurie felt this instinctively , and laid himself down again , with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain .
His look and silence , as well as a certain <unk> <unk> , ruffled Amy , and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay .
&quot; I wish you &apos;d do me the favor to <unk> yourself a little , &quot; she said sharply .
&quot; Do it for me , there &apos;s a dear girl . &quot;
&quot; I could , if I tried ; &quot; and she looked as if she would like doing it in the most <unk> style .
&quot; Try , then ; I give you leave , &quot; returned Laurie , who enjoyed having some one to tease , after his long <unk> from his favorite <unk> .
&quot; You &apos;d be angry in five minutes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m never angry with you .
It takes two <unk> to make a fire : you are as cool and soft as snow . &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t know what I can do ; snow <unk> a glow and a <unk> , if <unk> rightly .
Your indifference is half <unk> , and a good stirring up would prove it . &quot;
&quot; <unk> away ; it won &apos;t hurt me and it may amuse you , as the big man said when his little wife beat him .
<unk> me in the light of a husband or a carpet , and beat till you are tired , if that sort of exercise <unk> with you . &quot;
Being decidedly nettled herself , and longing to see him shake off the <unk> that so altered him , Amy <unk> both tongue and pencil , and began : -- &quot; Flo and I have got a new name for you ; it &apos;s &apos; <unk> Laurence . &apos;
How do you like it ? &quot;
She thought it would <unk> him ; but he only folded his arms under his head , with an <unk> &quot; That &apos;s not bad .
Thank you , ladies . &quot;
&quot; Do you want to know what I honestly think of you ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> to be told . &quot;
&quot; Well , I <unk> you . &quot;
If she had even said &quot; I hate you , &quot; in a <unk> or coquettish tone , he would have laughed , and rather liked it ; but the grave , almost sad , accent of her voice made him open his eyes , and ask quickly , -- &quot; Why , if you please ? &quot;
&quot; Because , with every chance for being good , useful , and happy , you are <unk> , lazy , and miserable . &quot;
&quot; <unk> language , mademoiselle . &quot;
&quot; If you like it , I &apos;ll go on . &quot;
&quot; Pray , do ; it &apos;s quite interesting . &quot;
&quot; I thought you &apos;d find it so ; selfish people always like to talk about themselves . &quot;
&quot; Am _ I _ selfish ? &quot;
The question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise , for the one virtue on which he prided himself was <unk> .
&quot; Yes , very selfish , &quot; continued Amy , in a calm , cool voice , twice as effective , just then , as an angry one .
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how , for I &apos;ve studied you while we have been <unk> , and I &apos;m not at all satisfied with you .
Here you have been abroad nearly six months , and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends . &quot;
&quot; Isn &apos;t a fellow to have any pleasure after a <unk> grind ? &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t look as if you &apos;d had much ; at any rate , you are none the better for it , as far as I can see .
I said , when we first met , that you had improved .
Now I take it all back , for I don &apos;t think you half so nice as when I left you at home .
You have grown <unk> lazy ; you like gossip , and waste time on frivolous things ; you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people , instead of being loved and respected by wise ones .
With money , talent , position , health , and beauty , <unk> , you like that , Old <unk> !
but it &apos;s the truth , so I can &apos;t help saying it , --with all these splendid things to use and enjoy , you can find nothing to do but dawdle ; and , instead of being the man you might and ought to be , you are <unk> &quot; There she stopped , with a look that had both pain and pity in it .
&quot; Saint Laurence on a <unk> , &quot; added Laurie , blandly finishing the sentence .
But the lecture began to take effect , for there was a wide-awake <unk> in his eyes now , and a <unk> , <unk> expression replaced the former indifference .
&quot; I supposed you &apos;d take it so .
You men tell us we are angels , and say we can make you what we will ; but the instant we honestly try to do you good , you laugh at us , and won &apos;t listen , which <unk> how much your <unk> is worth . &quot;
Amy spoke bitterly , and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet .
In a minute a hand came down over the page , so that she could not draw , and Laurie &apos;s voice said , with a droll imitation of a penitent child , -- &quot; I will be good , oh , I will be good ! &quot;
But Amy did not laugh , for she was in earnest ; and , <unk> on the <unk> hand with her pencil , said soberly , -- &quot; Aren &apos;t you ashamed of a hand like that ?
It &apos;s as soft and white as a woman &apos;s , and looks as if it never did anything but wear <unk> &apos;s best gloves , and pick flowers for ladies .
You are not a <unk> , thank <unk> !
so I &apos;m glad to see there are no diamonds or big <unk> on it , only the little old one Jo gave you so long ago .
Dear soul , I wish she was here to help me ! &quot;
&quot; So do I ! &quot;
The hand vanished as suddenly as it came , and there was energy enough in the <unk> of her wish to suit even Amy .
She glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind ; but he was lying with his hat half over his face , as if for shade , and his <unk> hid his mouth .
She only saw his chest rise and fall , with a long breath that might have been a sigh , and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass , as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of .
All in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and <unk> in Amy &apos;s mind , and told her what her sister never had confided to her .
She remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo ; she recalled the shadow on his face just now , the change in his character , and the wearing of the little old ring , which was no ornament to a handsome hand .
Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence .
Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the <unk> , and now she was sure of it .
Her keen eyes filled , and , when she spoke again , it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so .
&quot; I know I have no right to talk so to you , Laurie ; and if you weren &apos;t the <unk> fellow in the world , you &apos;d be very angry with me .
But we are all so fond and proud of you , I couldn &apos;t bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as I have been , though , perhaps , they would understand the change better than I do . &quot;
&quot; I think they would , &quot; came from under the hat , in a grim tone , quite as touching as a broken one .
&quot; They ought to have told me , and not let me go <unk> and scolding , when I should have been more kind and patient than ever .
I never did like that Miss Randal , and now I hate her ! &quot;
said artful Amy , wishing to be sure of her facts this time .
&quot; Hang Miss Randal ! &quot;
and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his <unk> toward that young lady .
&quot; I beg pardon ; I <unk> &quot; and there she paused <unk> .
&quot; No , you didn &apos;t ; you knew perfectly well I never cared for any one but Jo . &quot;
Laurie said that in his old , impetuous tone , and turned his face away as he spoke .
&quot; I did think so ; but as they never said anything about it , and you came away , I supposed I was mistaken .
And Jo wouldn &apos;t be kind to you ?
Why , I was sure she loved you dearly . &quot;
&quot; She _ was _ kind , but not in the right way ; and it &apos;s lucky for her she didn &apos;t love me , if I &apos;m the <unk> fellow you think me .
It &apos;s her fault , though , and you may tell her so . &quot;
The hard , bitter look came back again as he said that , and it troubled Amy , for she did not know what balm to <unk> .
&quot; I was wrong , I didn &apos;t know .
I &apos;m very sorry I was so cross , but I can &apos;t help wishing you &apos;d bear it better , Teddy , dear . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t , that &apos;s her name for me ! &quot;
and Laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo &apos;s <unk> , <unk> tone .
&quot; Wait till you &apos;ve tried it yourself , &quot; he added , in a low voice , as he pulled up the grass by the handful .
&quot; I &apos;d take it manfully , and be respected if I couldn &apos;t be loved , &quot; said Amy , with the decision of one who knew nothing about it .
Now , Laurie flattered himself that he _ had _ borne it remarkably well , making no moan , asking no sympathy , and taking his trouble away to live it down alone .
Amy &apos;s lecture put the matter in a new light , and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure , and shut himself up in moody indifference .
He felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream , and found it impossible to go to sleep again .
Presently he sat up , and asked slowly , -- &quot; Do you think Jo would <unk> me as you do ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , if she saw you now .
She hates lazy people .
Why don &apos;t you do something splendid , and _ make _ her love you ? &quot;
&quot; I did my best , but it was no use . &quot;
&quot; <unk> well , you mean ?
That was no more than you ought to have done , for your grandfather &apos;s sake .
It would have been <unk> to fail after spending so much time and money , when every one knew you _ could _ do well . &quot;
&quot; I did fail , say what you will , for Jo wouldn &apos;t love me , &quot; began Laurie , leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude .
&quot; No , you didn &apos;t , and you &apos;ll say so in the end , for it did you good , and proved that you could do something if you tried .
If you &apos;d only set about another task of some sort , you &apos;d soon be your hearty , happy self again , and forget your trouble . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s impossible . &quot;
&quot; Try it and see .
You needn &apos;t shrug your shoulders , and think , &apos; Much she knows about such things . &apos;
I don &apos;t <unk> to be wise , but I _ am _ observing , and I see a great deal more than you &apos;d imagine .
I &apos;m interested in other people &apos;s experiences and <unk> ; and , though I can &apos;t explain , I remember and use them for my own benefit .
Love Jo all your days , if you choose , but don &apos;t let it spoil you , for it &apos;s wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can &apos;t have the one you want .
There , I won &apos;t lecture any more , for I know you &apos;ll wake up and be a man in spite of that <unk> girl . &quot;
Neither spoke for several minutes .
Laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger , and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked .
Presently she put it on his knee , merely saying , -- &quot; How do you like that ? &quot;
He looked and then he smiled , as he could not well help doing , for it was capitally done , --the long , lazy figure on the grass , with listless face , <unk> eyes , and one hand holding a <unk> , from which came the little wreath of smoke that <unk> the <unk> &apos;s head .
&quot; How well you draw ! &quot;
he said , with genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill , adding , with a <unk> , -- &quot; Yes , that &apos;s me . &quot;
&quot; As you are : this is as you were ; &quot; and Amy laid another sketch beside the one he held .
It was not nearly so well done , but there was a life and spirit in it which <unk> for many faults , and it recalled the past so <unk> that a sudden change swept over the young man &apos;s face as he looked .
Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse ; hat and coat were off , and every line of the active figure , resolute face , and commanding attitude , was full of energy and meaning .
The handsome <unk> , just subdued , stood <unk> his neck under the tightly drawn <unk> , with one foot impatiently <unk> the ground , and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had <unk> him .
In the ruffled mane , the <unk> &apos;s <unk> hair and erect attitude , there was a <unk> of suddenly arrested motion , of strength , courage , and youthful <unk> , that contrasted sharply with the <unk> grace of the &quot; _ <unk> far <unk> _ &quot; sketch .
Laurie said nothing ; but , as his eye went from one to the other , Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him .
That satisfied her ; and , without waiting for him to speak , she said , in her sprightly way , -- &#91; Illustration : A rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse &#93; &quot; Don &apos;t you remember the day you played <unk> with <unk> , and we all looked on ?
Meg and Beth were frightened , but Jo clapped and pranced , and I sat on the fence and drew you .
I found that sketch in my portfolio the other day , touched it up , and kept it to show you . &quot;
&quot; Much obliged .
You &apos;ve improved immensely since then , and I congratulate you .
May I venture to suggest in &apos; a honeymoon <unk> &apos; that five o &apos;clock is the <unk> at your <unk> ? &quot;
Laurie rose as he spoke , returned the pictures with a smile and a bow , and looked at his watch , as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end .
He tried to <unk> his former easy , indifferent air , but it _ was _ an <unk> now , for the rousing had been more <unk> than he would confess .
Amy felt the shade of <unk> in his manner , and said to herself , -- &quot; Now I &apos;ve offended him .
Well , if it does him good , I &apos;m glad ; if it makes him hate me , I &apos;m sorry ; but it &apos;s true , and I can &apos;t take back a word of it . &quot;
They laughed and chatted all the way home ; and little <unk> , up behind , thought that <unk> and mademoiselle were in charming spirits .
But both felt ill at ease ; the friendly frankness was disturbed , the sunshine had a shadow over it , and <unk> their <unk> <unk> , there was a secret <unk> in the heart of each .
&quot; Shall we see you this evening , _ <unk> <unk> � <unk> _ ? &quot;
asked Amy as they parted at her aunt &apos;s door .
&quot; Unfortunately I have an engagement .
_ <unk> <unk> , mademoiselle _ , &quot; and Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand , in the foreign fashion , which became him better than many men .
Something in his face made Amy say quickly and warmly , -- &quot; No ; be yourself with me , Laurie , and part in the good old way .
I &apos;d rather have a hearty English <unk> than all the sentimental <unk> in France . &quot;
&quot; Good-by , dear , &quot; and with these words , uttered in the tone she liked , Laurie left her , after a <unk> almost painful in its <unk> .
Next morning , instead of the usual call , Amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end : -- &quot; MY DEAR <unk> , -- &quot; Please make my <unk> to your aunt , and exult within yourself , for &apos; <unk> Laurence &apos; has gone to his grandpa , like the best of boys .
A pleasant winter to you , and may the gods <unk> you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa !
I think Fred would be <unk> by a <unk> .
Tell him so , with my congratulations .
&quot; Yours gratefully , <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Good boy !
I &apos;m glad he &apos;s gone , &quot; said Amy , with an approving smile ; the next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room , adding , with an <unk> sigh , -- &quot; Yes , I _ am _ glad , but how I shall miss him ! &quot;

THE VALLEY OF THE <unk> .
When the first bitterness was over , the family accepted the <unk> , and tried to bear it cheerfully , helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind <unk> tenderly together in times of trouble .
They put away their grief , and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one .
The <unk> room in the house was set apart for Beth , and in it was gathered everything that she most loved , <unk> , pictures , her piano , the little <unk> , and the beloved <unk> .
Father &apos;s best books found their way there , mother &apos;s easy-chair , Jo &apos;s desk , Amy &apos;s finest sketches ; and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage , to make sunshine for <unk> Beth .
John quietly set apart a little sum , that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for ; old Hannah never wearied of <unk> dainty dishes to <unk> a <unk> appetite , dropping tears as she worked ; and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters , seeming to bring <unk> of warmth and <unk> from <unk> that know no winter .
Here , cherished like a household saint in its shrine , sat Beth , tranquil and busy as ever ; for nothing could change the sweet , unselfish nature , and even while preparing to leave life , she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind .
The feeble fingers were never idle , and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the <unk> daily passing to and fro , --to drop a pair of <unk> from her window for a pair of purple hands , a <unk> for some small mother of many dolls , <unk> for young <unk> <unk> through <unk> of <unk> , <unk> for <unk> eyes , and all manner of pleasant devices , till the <unk> <unk> up the ladder of learning found their way <unk> with flowers , as it were , and came to regard the gentle <unk> as a sort of fairy <unk> , who sat above there , and <unk> down gifts <unk> suited to their tastes and needs .
If Beth had wanted any reward , she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window , with nods and smiles , and the droll little letters which came to her , full of <unk> and gratitude .
The first few months were very happy ones , and Beth often used to look round , and say &quot; How beautiful this is ! &quot;
as they all sat together in her sunny room , the babies <unk> and <unk> on the floor , mother and sisters working near , and father reading , in his pleasant voice , from the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words , as applicable now as when written <unk> ago ; a little chapel , where a paternal <unk> taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn , trying to show them that hope can comfort love , and faith make resignation possible .
Simple sermons , that went straight to the souls of those who listened ; for the father &apos;s heart was in the minister &apos;s religion , and the frequent <unk> in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read .
It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come ; for , by and by , Beth said the needle was &quot; so heavy , &quot; and put it down forever ; talking wearied her , faces troubled her , pain <unk> her for its own , and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the <unk> that <unk> her feeble flesh .
Ah me !
such heavy days , such long , long <unk> , such aching hearts and imploring prayers , when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them <unk> , to hear the bitter cry , &quot; <unk> me , help me ! &quot;
and to feel that there was no help .
A sad <unk> of the serene soul , a sharp struggle of the young life with death ; but both were <unk> brief , and then , the natural <unk> over , the old peace returned more beautiful than ever .
With the wreck of her frail body , Beth &apos;s soul grew strong ; and , though she said little , those about her felt that she was ready , saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the <unk> , and waited with her on the shore , trying to see the <unk> <unk> coming to receive her when she <unk> the river .
Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said , &quot; I feel stronger when you are here . &quot;
She slept on a <unk> in the room , waking often to <unk> the fire , to feed , lift , or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything , and &quot; tried not to be a trouble . &quot;
All day she haunted the room , jealous of any other nurse , and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her .
<unk> and helpful hours to Jo , for now her heart received the teaching that it needed ; lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them ; charity for all , the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget <unk> , the loyalty to duty that makes the <unk> easy , and the sincere faith that fears nothing , but <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , when she woke , Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book , heard her singing softly , to <unk> the <unk> night , or saw her <unk> her face upon her hands , while slow tears dropped through the <unk> fingers ; and Jo would lie watching her , with thoughts too deep for tears , feeling that Beth , in her simple , unselfish way , was trying to <unk> herself from the dear old life , and fit herself for the life to come , by sacred words of comfort , quiet prayers , and the music she loved so well .
Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons , the <unk> <unk> , the most <unk> prayers that any voice could utter ; for , with eyes made clear by many tears , and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow , she <unk> the beauty of her sister &apos;s life , <unk> , <unk> , yet full of the genuine virtues which &quot; smell sweet , and blossom in the dust , &quot; the <unk> that makes the <unk> on earth remembered <unk> in heaven , the true success which is possible to all .
One night , when Beth looked among the books upon her table , to find something to make her forget the mortal <unk> that was almost as hard to bear as pain , as she turned the leaves of her old favorite Pilgrim &apos;s Progress , she found a little paper , scribbled over in Jo &apos;s hand .
The name caught her eye , and the <unk> look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it .
&quot; Poor Jo !
she &apos;s fast asleep , so I won &apos;t wake her to ask leave ; she shows me all her things , and I don &apos;t think she &apos;ll mind if I look at this , &quot; thought Beth , with a glance at her sister , who lay on the rug , with the tongs beside her , ready to wake up the minute the <unk> fell apart .
&quot; MY BETH .
&quot; Sitting patient in the shadow <unk> the blessed light shall come , A serene and saintly presence <unk> our troubled home .
<unk> joys and hopes and sorrows <unk> like <unk> on the <unk> Of the deep and solemn river Where her willing feet now stand .
&quot; O my sister , passing from me , Out of human care and <unk> , Leave me , as a gift , those virtues Which have beautified your life .
Dear , <unk> me that great patience Which has power to sustain A cheerful , <unk> spirit In its <unk> of pain .
&quot; Give me , for I need it sorely , Of that courage , wise and sweet , Which has made the path of duty <unk> <unk> your willing feet .
Give me that unselfish nature , That with charity divine Can pardon wrong for love &apos;s dear <unk> <unk> heart , forgive me mine !
&quot; <unk> our parting daily <unk> Something of its bitter pain , And while learning this hard lesson , My great loss becomes my <unk> .
For the touch of grief will render My wild nature more serene , Give to life new <unk> , A new trust in the unseen .
&quot; <unk> , safe across the river , I shall see <unk> A beloved , household spirit <unk> for me on the shore .
Hope and faith , born of my sorrow , <unk> angels shall become , And the sister gone before me By their hands shall lead me home . &quot;
<unk> and blotted , <unk> and feeble , as the lines were , they brought a look of <unk> comfort to Beth &apos;s face , for her one regret had been that she had done so little ; and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been <unk> , that her death would not bring the despair she feared .
As she sat with the paper folded between her hands , the <unk> <unk> fell <unk> .
Jo started up , revived the blaze , and crept to the bedside , hoping Beth slept .
&quot; Not asleep , but so happy , dear .
See , I found this and read it ; I knew you wouldn &apos;t care .
Have I been all that to you , Jo ? &quot;
she asked , with wistful , humble earnestness .
&quot; O Beth , so much , so much ! &quot;
and Jo &apos;s head went down upon the pillow , beside her sister &apos;s .
&quot; Then I don &apos;t feel as if I &apos;d wasted my life .
I &apos;m not so good as you make me , but I _ have _ tried to do right ; and now , when it &apos;s too late to begin even to do better , it &apos;s such a comfort to know that some one loves me so much , and feels as if I &apos;d helped them . &quot;
&quot; More than any one in the world , Beth .
I used to think I couldn &apos;t let you go ; but I &apos;m learning to feel that I don &apos;t lose you ; that you &apos;ll be more to me than ever , and death can &apos;t part us , though it seems to . &quot;
&quot; I know it cannot , and I don &apos;t fear it any longer , for I &apos;m sure I shall be your Beth still , to love and help you more than ever .
You must take my place , Jo , and be everything to father and mother when I &apos;m gone .
They will turn to you , don &apos;t fail them ; and if it &apos;s hard to work alone , remember that I don &apos;t forget you , and that you &apos;ll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world ; for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go , and it makes the end so easy . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll try , Beth ; &quot; and then and there Jo <unk> her old ambition , <unk> herself to a new and better one , <unk> the poverty of other desires , and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the <unk> of love .
So the spring days came and went , the sky grew clearer , the earth <unk> , the flowers were up fair and early , and the birds came back in time to say good-by to Beth , who , like a tired but <unk> child , clung to the hands that had led her all her life , as father and mother <unk> her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow , and gave her up to God .
<unk> , except in books , do the dying utter <unk> words , see visions , or <unk> with <unk> <unk> ; and those who have <unk> many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply as sleep .
As Beth had hoped , the &quot; tide went out easily ; &quot; and in the dark hour before the dawn , on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath , she quietly drew her last , with no farewell but one loving look , one little sigh .
With tears and prayers and tender hands , mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never <unk> again , seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful <unk> that soon replaced the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long , and feeling , with <unk> joy , that to their darling death was a benignant angel , not a <unk> full of dread .
When morning came , for the first time in many months the fire was out , Jo &apos;s place was empty , and the room was very still .
But a bird sang blithely on a budding <unk> , close by , the <unk> blossomed freshly at the window , and the spring sunshine <unk> in like a <unk> over the placid face upon the pillow , --a face so full of <unk> peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears , and thanked God that Beth was well at last .

<unk> TO <unk> .
Amy &apos;s lecture did Laurie good , though , of course , he did not own it till long afterward ; men seldom do , for when women are the <unk> , the lords of creation don &apos;t take the advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do ; then they act upon it , and , if it <unk> , they give the <unk> <unk> half the credit of it ; if it fails , they generously give her the whole .
Laurie went back to his grandfather , and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the <unk> of Nice had improved him wonderfully , and he had better try it again .
There was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better , but <unk> could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received ; pride <unk> , and whenever the longing grew very strong , he <unk> his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest impression , &quot; I <unk> you ; &quot; &quot; Go and do something splendid that will _ make _ her love you . &quot;
Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he _ had _ been selfish and lazy ; but then when a man has a great sorrow , he should be indulged in all sorts of <unk> till he has lived it down .
He felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now ; and , though he should never <unk> to be a faithful <unk> , there was no occasion to wear his <unk> <unk> .
Jo _ wouldn &apos;t _ love him , but he might _ make _ her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a girl &apos;s &quot; No &quot; had not spoilt his life .
He had always meant to do something , and Amy &apos;s advice was quite unnecessary .
He had only been waiting till the <unk> blighted affections were <unk> <unk> ; that being done , he felt that he was ready to &quot; hide his stricken heart , and still <unk> on . &quot;
As <unk> , when he had a joy or a grief , put it into a song , so Laurie resolved to <unk> his <unk> in music , and compose a <unk> which should <unk> up Jo &apos;s soul and melt the heart of every <unk> .
<unk> the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody , and ordered him off , he went to <unk> , where he had musical friends , and fell to work with the firm <unk> to <unk> himself .
But , whether the sorrow was too <unk> to be <unk> in music , or music too <unk> to <unk> a mortal woe , he soon discovered that the <unk> was beyond him , just at present .
It was evident that his mind was not in working order yet , and his ideas needed <unk> ; for often in the middle of a plaintive strain , he would find himself humming a dancing tune that <unk> recalled the Christmas ball at Nice , especially the stout Frenchman , and put an <unk> stop to tragic <unk> for the time being .
Then he tried an <unk> , for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning ; but here , again , <unk> <unk> <unk> him .
He wanted Jo for his heroine , and called upon his memory to supply him with tender <unk> and romantic visions of his love .
But memory turned <unk> ; and , as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl , would only <unk> Jo &apos;s <unk> , faults , and <unk> , would only show her in the most <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with her head tied up in a <unk> , <unk> herself with the <unk> , or throwing cold water over his passion _ � la _ <unk> , --and an irresistible laugh spoilt the pensive picture he was <unk> to paint .
Jo wouldn &apos;t be put into the <unk> at any price , and he had to give her up with a &quot; Bless that girl , what a torment she is ! &quot;
and a <unk> at his hair , as became a distracted <unk> .
When he looked about him for another and a less <unk> <unk> to <unk> in melody , memory produced one with the most obliging <unk> .
This <unk> wore many faces , but it always had golden hair , was enveloped in a <unk> cloud , and floated <unk> before his mind &apos;s eye in a pleasing <unk> of roses , peacocks , white ponies , and blue ribbons .
He did not give the <unk> <unk> any name , but he took her for his heroine , and grew quite fond of her , as well he might ; for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun , and escorted her , <unk> , through trials which would have <unk> any mortal woman .
Thanks to this inspiration , he got on <unk> for a time , but gradually the work lost its charm , and he forgot to compose , while he sat <unk> , pen in hand , or roamed about the gay city to get new ideas and refresh his mind , which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter .
He did not do much , but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself .
&quot; It &apos;s genius simmering , perhaps .
I &apos;ll let it <unk> , and see what comes of it , &quot; he said , with a secret suspicion , all the while , that it wasn &apos;t genius , but something far more common .
Whatever it was , it <unk> to some purpose , for he grew more and more discontented with his <unk> life , began to long for some real and earnest work to go at , soul and body , and finally came to the wise conclusion that every one who loved music was not a <unk> .
<unk> from one of <unk> &apos;s grand <unk> , splendidly performed at the <unk> <unk> , he looked over his own , played a few of the best parts , sat staring up at the busts of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , who stared benignly back again ; then suddenly he tore up his <unk> , one by one , and , as the last <unk> out of his hand , he said soberly to himself , -- &quot; She is right !
<unk> isn &apos;t genius , and you can &apos;t make it so .
That music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her , and I won &apos;t be a <unk> any longer .
Now what shall I do ? &quot;
That seemed a hard question to answer , and Laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread .
Now , if ever , occurred an <unk> opportunity for &quot; going to the <unk> , &quot; as he once <unk> expressed it , for he had plenty of money and nothing to do , and <unk> is <unk> fond of providing <unk> for full and idle hands .
The poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within , but he <unk> them pretty well ; for , much as he valued liberty , he valued good faith and confidence more , so his promise to his grandfather , and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him , and say &quot; All &apos;s well , &quot; kept him safe and steady .
Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe , &quot; I don &apos;t believe it ; boys will be boys , young men must <unk> their wild <unk> , and women must not expect <unk> . &quot;
I dare say _ you _ don &apos;t , Mrs. Grundy , but it &apos;s true nevertheless .
Women work a good many <unk> , and I have a <unk> that they may perform even that of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> by <unk> to <unk> such <unk> .
Let the boys be boys , the longer the better , and let the young men <unk> their wild <unk> if they must ; but mothers , sisters , and friends may help to make the crop a small one , and keep many <unk> from spoiling the <unk> , by believing , and showing that they believe , in the <unk> of loyalty to the virtues which make men <unk> in good women &apos;s eyes .
If it _ is _ a feminine delusion , leave us to enjoy it while we may , for without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost , and sorrowful <unk> would <unk> all our hopes of the brave , tender-hearted little lads , who still love their mothers better than themselves , and are not ashamed to own it .
Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would <unk> all his powers for years ; but , to his great surprise , he discovered it grew easier every day .
He refused to believe it at first , got angry with himself , and couldn &apos;t understand it ; but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things , and time and nature work their will in spite of us .
Laurie &apos;s heart _ wouldn &apos;t _ ache ; the wound persisted in <unk> with a rapidity that astonished him , and , instead of trying to forget , he found himself trying to remember .
He had not <unk> this turn of affairs , and was not prepared for it .
He was disgusted with himself , surprised at his own <unk> , and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon .
He carefully stirred up the <unk> of his lost love , but they refused to burst into a blaze : there was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever , and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly <unk> into a more tranquil sentiment , very tender , a little sad and resentful still , but that was sure to pass away in time , leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end .
As the word &quot; brotherly &quot; passed through his mind in one of these <unk> , he smiled , and glanced up at the picture of <unk> that was before him : -- &quot; Well , he was a great man ; and when he couldn &apos;t have one sister he took the other , and was happy . &quot;
Laurie did not utter the words , but he thought them ; and the next instant kissed the little old ring , saying to himself , -- &quot; No , I won &apos;t !
I haven &apos;t forgotten , I never can .
I &apos;ll try again , and if that fails , why , <unk> &quot; Leaving his sentence unfinished , he seized pen and paper and wrote to Jo , telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind .
Couldn &apos;t she , wouldn &apos;t she , and let him come home and be happy ?
While waiting for an answer he did nothing , but he did it energetically , for he was in a fever of impatience .
It came at last , and settled his mind effectually on one point , for Jo decidedly couldn &apos;t and wouldn &apos;t .
She was wrapped up in Beth , and never wished to hear the word &quot; love &quot; again .
Then she begged him to be happy with somebody else , but always to keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister Jo .
In a <unk> she desired him not to tell Amy that Beth was worse ; she was coming home in the spring , and there was no need of <unk> the <unk> of her stay .
That would be time enough , please God , but Laurie must write to her often , and not let her feel lonely , homesick , or anxious .
&quot; So I will , at once .
Poor little girl ; it will be a sad going home for her , I &apos;m afraid ; &quot; and Laurie opened his desk , as if writing to Amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before .
But he did not write the letter that day ; for , as he <unk> out his best paper , he came across something which changed his purpose .
<unk> about in one part of the desk , among bills , <unk> , and business <unk> of various kinds , were several of Jo &apos;s letters , and in another <unk> were three notes from Amy , carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons , and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside .
With a <unk> , <unk> expression , Laurie gathered up all Jo &apos;s letters , smoothed , folded , and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk , stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger , then slowly drew it off , laid it with the letters , locked the drawer , and went out to hear <unk> <unk> at Saint <unk> &apos;s , feeling as if there had been a funeral ; and , though not <unk> with affliction , this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies .
&#91; Illustration : Turning the ring thoughtfully upon his finger &#93; The letter went very soon , however , and was promptly answered , for Amy _ was _ homesick , and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner .
The <unk> flourished <unk> , and letters flew to and fro , with <unk> regularity , all through the early spring .
Laurie sold his busts , made <unk> of his opera , and went back to Paris , hoping somebody would arrive before long .
He wanted desperately to go to Nice , but would not till he was asked ; and Amy would not ask him , for just then she was having little experiences of her own , which made her rather wish to avoid the <unk> eyes of &quot; our boy . &quot;
Fred Vaughn had returned , and put the question to which she had once decided to answer &quot; Yes , thank you ; &quot; but now she said , &quot; No , thank you , &quot; kindly but steadily ; for , when the time came , her courage failed her , and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears .
The words , &quot; Fred is a good fellow , but not at all the man I fancied you would ever like , &quot; and Laurie &apos;s face when he uttered them , kept returning to her as <unk> as her own did when she said in look , if not in words , &quot; I shall marry for money . &quot;
It troubled her to remember that now , she wished she could take it back , it sounded so <unk> .
She didn &apos;t want Laurie to think her a <unk> , worldly creature ; she didn &apos;t care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a <unk> woman ; she was so glad he didn &apos;t hate her for the dreadful things she said , but took them so beautifully , and was kinder than ever .
His letters were such a comfort , for the home letters were very <unk> , and were not half so satisfactory as his when they did come .
It was not only a pleasure , but a duty to answer them , for the poor fellow was forlorn , and needed petting , since Jo persisted in being <unk> .
She ought to have made an effort , and tried to love him ; it couldn &apos;t be very hard , many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them ; but Jo never would act like other girls , so there was nothing to do but be very kind , and treat him like a brother .
If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period , they would be a much happier race of beings than they are .
Amy never lectured now ; she asked his opinion on all <unk> ; she was interested in everything he did , made charming little presents for him , and sent him two letters a week , full of lively gossip , sisterly confidences , and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her .
As few brothers are <unk> by having their letters carried about in their sisters &apos; pockets , read and <unk> diligently , cried over when short , kissed when long , and <unk> carefully , we will not hint that Amy did any of these fond and foolish things .
But she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring , lost much of her relish for society , and went out sketching alone a good deal .
She never had much to show when she came home , but was studying nature , I dare say , while she sat for hours , with her hands folded , on the terrace at Valrosa , or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her , --a <unk> knight <unk> on a tomb , a young man asleep in the grass , with his hat over his eyes , or a <unk> girl in gorgeous array , <unk> down a <unk> on the arm of a tall gentleman , both faces being left a <unk> according to the last fashion in art , which was safe , but not altogether satisfactory .
Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred ; and , finding <unk> <unk> and <unk> impossible , Amy left her to think what she liked , taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to <unk> .
That was all , but he understood it , and looked relieved , as he said to himself , with a venerable air , -- &quot; I was sure she would think better of it .
Poor old fellow !
I &apos;ve been through it all , and I can sympathize . &quot;
With that he <unk> a great sigh , and then , as if he had <unk> his duty to the past , put his feet up on the sofa , and enjoyed Amy &apos;s letter luxuriously .
While these changes were going on abroad , trouble had come at home ; but the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy , and when the next found her , the grass was green above her sister .
The sad news met her at Vevay , for the <unk> had driven them from Nice in May , and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland , by way of <unk> and the Italian <unk> .
She bore it very well , and quietly <unk> to the family <unk> that she should not <unk> her visit , for , since it was too late to say good-by to Beth , she had better stay , and let absence <unk> her sorrow .
But her heart was very heavy ; she longed to be at home , and every day looked wistfully across the lake , waiting for Laurie to come and comfort her .
He did come very soon ; for the same mail brought letters to them both , but he was in Germany , and it took some days to reach him .
The moment he read it , he packed his <unk> , bade <unk> to his <unk> , and was off to keep his promise , with a heart full of joy and sorrow , hope and suspense .
He knew Vevay well ; and as soon as the boat touched the little <unk> , he hurried along the shore to <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> were living _ en <unk> _ .
The _ <unk> � on _ was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake ; but no , the <unk> mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden .
If <unk> would give himself the pain of sitting down , a flash of time should present her .
But <unk> could not wait even &quot; a flash of time , &quot; and , in the middle of the speech , departed to find mademoiselle himself .
A pleasant old garden on the <unk> of the lovely lake , with <unk> rustling overhead , ivy <unk> everywhere , and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water .
At one corner of the wide , low wall was a seat , and here Amy often came to read or work , or console herself with the beauty all about her .
She was sitting here that day , leaning her head on her hand , with a homesick heart and heavy eyes , thinking of Beth , and wondering why Laurie did not come .
She did not hear him cross the <unk> beyond , nor see him pause in the <unk> that led from the <unk> path into the garden .
He stood a minute , looking at her with new eyes , seeing what no one had ever seen before , --the tender side of Amy &apos;s character .
Everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow , --the blotted letters in her lap , the black ribbon that tied up her hair , the womanly pain and patience in her face ; even the little <unk> cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie , for he had given it to her , and she wore it as her only ornament .
If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him , they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him ; for , dropping everything , she ran to him , exclaiming , in a tone of <unk> love and longing , -- &quot; O Laurie , Laurie , I knew you &apos;d come to me ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : O Laurie , Laurie , I knew you &apos;d come &#93; I think everything was said and settled then ; for , as they stood together quite silent for a moment , with the dark head bent down <unk> over the light one , Amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as Laurie , and Laurie decided that Amy was the only woman in the world who could fill Jo &apos;s place , and make him happy .
He did not tell her so ; but she was not disappointed , for both felt the truth , were satisfied , and gladly left the rest to silence .
In a minute Amy went back to her place ; and , while she dried her tears , Laurie gathered up the scattered papers , finding in the sight of sundry well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future .
As he sat down beside her , Amy felt shy again , and turned rosy red at the recollection of her <unk> greeting .
&quot; I couldn &apos;t help it ; I felt so lonely and sad , and was so very glad to see you .
It was such a surprise to look up and find you , just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn &apos;t come , &quot; she said , trying in vain to speak quite naturally .
&quot; I came the minute I heard .
I wish I could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little Beth ; but I can only feel , and-- &quot; He could not get any further , for he , too , turned bashful all of a sudden , and did not quite know what to say .
He longed to lay Amy &apos;s head down on his shoulder , and tell her to have a good cry , but he did not dare ; so took her hand instead , and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words .
&quot; You needn &apos;t say anything ; this comforts me , &quot; she said softly .
&quot; Beth is well and happy , and I mustn &apos;t wish her back ; but I dread the going home , much as I long to see them all .
We won &apos;t talk about it now , for it makes me cry , and I want to enjoy you while you stay .
You needn &apos;t go right back , need you ? &quot;
&quot; Not if you want me , dear . &quot;
&quot; I do , so much .
Aunt and Flo are very kind ; but you seem like one of the family , and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while . &quot;
Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child , whose heart was full , that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once , and gave her just what she wanted , --the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed .
&quot; Poor little soul , you look as if you &apos;d grieved yourself <unk> !
I &apos;m going to take care of you , so don &apos;t cry any more , but come and walk about with me ; the wind is too chilly for you to sit still , &quot; he said , in the <unk> , <unk> way that Amy liked , as he tied on her hat , drew her arm through his , and began to pace up and down the sunny walk , under the <unk> <unk> .
He felt more at ease upon his legs ; and Amy found it very pleasant to have a strong arm to <unk> upon , a familiar face to smile at her , and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone .
The quaint old garden had <unk> many pairs of lovers , and seemed <unk> made for them , so sunny and <unk> was it , with nothing but the tower to <unk> them , and the wide lake to carry away the <unk> of their words , as it <unk> by below .
For an hour this new pair walked and talked , or rested on the wall , enjoying the sweet <unk> which gave such a charm to time and place ; and when an unromantic <unk> <unk> them away , Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden .
The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl &apos;s altered face , she was illuminated with a new idea , and exclaimed to herself , &quot; Now I understand it all , --the child has been pining for young Laurence .
Bless my heart , I never thought of such a thing ! &quot;
With praiseworthy discretion , the good lady said nothing , and betrayed no sign of <unk> ; but cordially <unk> Laurie to stay , and begged Amy to enjoy his society , for it would do her more good than so much solitude .
Amy was a model of <unk> ; and , as her aunt was a good deal <unk> with Flo , she was left to entertain her friend , and did it with more than her usual success .
At Nice , Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded ; at Vevay , Laurie was never idle , but always walking , riding , boating , or studying , in the most energetic manner , while Amy admired everything he did , and followed his example as far and as fast as she could .
He said the change was <unk> to the <unk> , and she did not <unk> him , being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits .
The <unk> air did them both good , and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as <unk> .
They seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills ; the fresh winds blew away <unk> doubts , <unk> fancies , and moody <unk> ; the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of <unk> ideas , tender hopes , and happy thoughts ; the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past , and the grand old <unk> to look benignly down upon them , saying , &quot; Little children , love one another . &quot;
In spite of the new sorrow , it was a very happy time , so happy that Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word .
It took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the <unk> cure of his first , and , as he had firmly believed , his last and only love .
He consoled himself for the seeming <unk> by the thought that Jo &apos;s sister was almost the same as Jo &apos;s self , and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well .
His first wooing had been of the <unk> order , and he looked back upon it as if through a long <unk> of years , with a feeling of <unk> <unk> with regret .
He was not ashamed of it , but put it away as one of the <unk> experiences of his life , for which he could be grateful when the pain was over .
His second wooing he resolved should be as calm and simple as possible ; there was no need of having a scene , hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her ; she knew it without words , and had given him his answer long ago .
It all came about so naturally that no one could complain , and he knew that everybody would be pleased , even Jo .
But when our first little passion has been crushed , we are apt to be <unk> and slow in making a second trial ; so Laurie let the days pass , enjoying every hour , and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance .
He had rather imagined that the _ d� � <unk> _ would take place in the chateau garden by moonlight , and in the most graceful and decorous manner ; but it turned out exactly the <unk> , for the matter was settled on the lake , at <unk> , in a few blunt words .
They had been floating about all the morning , from gloomy St. <unk> to sunny <unk> , with the <unk> of <unk> on one side , <unk> St. <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the other , pretty Vevay in the valley , and <unk> upon the hill beyond , a <unk> blue sky overhead , and the <unk> lake below , <unk> with the picturesque boats that look like <unk> <unk> .
They had been talking of <unk> , as they glided past <unk> , and of <unk> , as they looked up at <unk> , where he wrote his &quot; <unk> � <unk> . &quot;
Neither had read it , but they knew it was a <unk> , and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own .
Amy had been <unk> her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them , and , when she looked up , Laurie was leaning on his oars , with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily , merely for the sake of saying something , -- &quot; You must be tired ; rest a little , and let me row ; it will do me good ; for , since you came , I have been altogether lazy and luxurious . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not tired ; but you may take an oar , if you like .
There &apos;s room enough , though I have to sit nearly in the middle , else the boat won &apos;t <unk> , &quot; returned Laurie , as if he rather liked the arrangement .
Feeling that she had not mended matters much , Amy took the offered third of a seat , shook her hair over her face , and accepted an oar .
She rowed as well as she did many other things ; and , though she used both hands , and Laurie but one , the oars kept time , and the boat went smoothly through the water .
&#91; Illustration : How well we pull together &#93; &quot; How well we pull together , don &apos;t we ? &quot;
said Amy , who objected to silence just then .
&quot; So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat .
Will you , Amy ? &quot;
very tenderly .
&quot; Yes , Laurie , &quot; very low .
Then they both stopped <unk> , and unconsciously added a pretty little _ <unk> _ of human love and happiness to the <unk> views reflected in the lake .
<unk> .
ALL <unk> .
It was easy to promise <unk> when self was wrapped up in another , and heart and soul were <unk> by a sweet example ; but when the helpful voice was silent , the daily lesson over , the beloved presence gone , and nothing remained but loneliness and grief , then Jo found her promise very hard to keep .
How could she &quot; comfort father and mother , &quot; when her own heart ached with a <unk> longing for her sister ; how could she &quot; make the house cheerful , &quot; when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home for the new ; and where in all the world could she &quot; find some useful , happy work to do , &quot; that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward ?
She tried in a blind , <unk> way to do her duty , secretly <unk> against it all the while , for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened , her burdens made <unk> , and life get harder and harder as she <unk> along .
Some people seemed to get all sunshine , and some all shadow ; it was not fair , for she tried more than Amy to be good , but never got any reward , only disappointment , trouble , and hard work .
Poor Jo , these were dark days to her , for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house , devoted to <unk> cares , a few small pleasures , and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier .
&quot; I can &apos;t do it .
I wasn &apos;t meant for a life like this , and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if somebody don &apos;t come and help me , &quot; she said to herself , when her first efforts failed , and she fell into the moody , miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to <unk> to the <unk> .
But some one did come and help her , though Jo did not <unk> her good angels at once , because they wore familiar <unk> , and used the simple <unk> best fitted to poor <unk> .
<unk> she started up at night , thinking Beth called her ; and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of an <unk> sorrow , &quot; O Beth , come back !
come back ! &quot;
she did not stretch out her <unk> arms in vain ; for , as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sister &apos;s <unk> whisper , her mother came to comfort her , not with words only , but the patient tenderness that <unk> by a touch , tears that were mute <unk> of a greater grief than Jo &apos;s , and broken whispers , more eloquent than prayers , because hopeful resignation went <unk> with natural sorrow .
<unk> moments , when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night , turning affliction to a blessing , which <unk> grief and strengthened love .
Feeling this , Jo &apos;s burden seemed easier to bear , duty grew sweeter , and life looked more <unk> , seen from the safe shelter of her mother &apos;s arms .
When aching heart was a little comforted , troubled mind likewise found help ; for one day she went to the study , and , leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile , she said , very humbly , -- &quot; Father , talk to me as you did to Beth .
I need it more than she did , for I &apos;m all wrong . &quot;
&quot; My dear , nothing can comfort me like this , &quot; he answered , with a <unk> in his voice , and both arms round her , as if he , too , needed help , and did not fear to ask it .
&#91; Illustration : Jo and her father &#93; Then , sitting in Beth &apos;s little chair close beside him , Jo told her troubles , --the resentful sorrow for her loss , the <unk> efforts that <unk> her , the want of faith that made life look so dark , and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair .
She gave him entire confidence , he gave her the help she needed , and both found consolation in the act ; for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter , but as man and woman , able and glad to serve each other with <unk> sympathy as well as <unk> love .
Happy , thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called &quot; the <unk> of one member , &quot; and from which she came with fresh courage , recovered cheerfulness , and a more submissive spirit ; for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear , were trying now to teach another to accept life without <unk> or <unk> , and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power .
Other helps had Jo , <unk> , wholesome duties and delights that would not be <unk> their part in <unk> her , and which she slowly learned to see and value .
<unk> and <unk> never could be as <unk> as they once had been , for Beth had presided over both ; and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to <unk> round the little mop and the old <unk> , that was never thrown away .
As she used them , Jo found herself humming the songs Beth used to hum , imitating Beth &apos;s <unk> ways , and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cosey , which was the first step toward making home happy , though she didn &apos;t know it , till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand , -- &quot; You thoughtful <unk> , you &apos;re determined we sha &apos;n&apos;t miss that dear <unk> ef you can help it .
We don &apos;t say much , but we see it , and the Lord will bless you for &apos;t , see ef He don &apos;t . &quot;
As they sat sewing together , Jo discovered how much improved her sister Meg was ; how well she could talk , how much she knew about good , womanly <unk> , thoughts , and feelings , how happy she was in husband and children , and how much they were all doing for each other .
&quot; <unk> is an excellent thing , after all .
I wonder if I should blossom out half as well as you have , if I tried it ? &quot;
said Jo , as she <unk> a <unk> for Demi , in the topsy-turvy nursery .
&quot; It &apos;s just what you need to bring out the tender , womanly half of your nature , Jo .
You are like a <unk> , prickly outside , but <unk> within , and a sweet <unk> , if one can only get at it .
Love will make you show your heart some day , and then the rough burr will fall off . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , ma &apos;am , and it takes a good shake to bring them down .
Boys go <unk> , and I don &apos;t care to be <unk> by them , &quot; returned Jo , <unk> away at the <unk> which no wind that blows would ever carry up , for Daisy had tied herself on as a <unk> .
Meg laughed , for she was glad to see a <unk> of Jo &apos;s old spirit , but she felt it her duty to <unk> her opinion by every argument in her power ; and the sisterly <unk> were not wasted , especially as two of Meg &apos;s most effective <unk> were the babies , whom Jo loved tenderly .
<unk> is the best <unk> for some hearts , and Jo &apos;s was nearly ready for the bag : a little more sunshine to ripen the <unk> , then , not a boy &apos;s impatient shake , but a man &apos;s hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr , and find the <unk> sound and sweet .
If she had suspected this , she would have shut up tight , and been more prickly than ever ; <unk> she wasn &apos;t thinking about herself , so , when the time came , down she dropped .
Now , if she had been the heroine of a moral story-book , she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly , <unk> the world , and gone about doing good in a <unk> bonnet , with <unk> in her pocket .
But , you see , Jo wasn &apos;t a heroine ; she was only a struggling human girl , like hundreds of others , and she just acted out her nature , being sad , cross , listless , or energetic , as the mood suggested .
It &apos;s highly virtuous to say we &apos;ll be good , but we can &apos;t do it all at once , and it takes a long pull , a strong pull , and a pull all together , before some of us even get our feet set in the right way .
Jo had got so far , she was learning to do her duty , and to feel unhappy if she did not ; but to do it <unk> , that was another thing !
She had often said she wanted to do something splendid , no matter how hard ; and now she had her wish , for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to father and mother , trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her ?
And , if <unk> were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort , what could be harder for a restless , ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes , plans , and desires , and cheerfully live for others ?
<unk> had taken her at her word ; here was the task , not what she had expected , but better , because self had no part in it : now , could she do it ?
She decided that she would try ; and , in her first attempt , she found the helps I have suggested .
<unk> another was given her , and she took it , not as a reward , but as a comfort , as Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little <unk> where he rested , as he climbed the hill called <unk> .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you write ?
That always used to make you happy , &quot; said her mother , once , when the <unk> fit <unk> Jo .
&quot; I &apos;ve no heart to write , and if I had , nobody cares for my things . &quot;
&quot; We do ; write something for us , and never mind the rest of the world .
Try it , dear ; I &apos;m sure it would do you good , and please us very much . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t believe I can ; &quot; but Jo got out her desk , and began to <unk> her half-finished manuscripts .
An hour afterward her mother peeped in , and there she was , scratching away , with her black pinafore on , and an absorbed expression , which caused Mrs. March to smile , and slip away , well pleased with the success of her <unk> .
Jo never knew how it happened , but something got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it ; for , when her family had laughed and cried over it , her father sent it , much against her will , to one of the popular <unk> , and , to her utter surprise , it was not only paid for , but others requested .
Letters from several persons , whose praise was honor , followed the appearance of the little story , newspapers copied it , and strangers as well as friends admired it .
For a small thing it was a great success ; and Jo was more astonished than when her novel was <unk> and <unk> all at once .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand it .
What _ can _ there be in a simple little story like that , to make people praise it so ? &quot;
she said , quite bewildered .
&quot; There is truth in it , Jo , that &apos;s the secret ; humor and <unk> make it alive , and you have found your style at last .
You wrote with no thought of fame or money , and put your heart into it , my daughter ; you have had the bitter , now comes the sweet .
Do your best , and grow as happy as we are in your success . &quot;
&quot; If there _ is _ anything good or true in what I write , it isn &apos;t mine ; I owe it all to you and mother and to Beth , &quot; said Jo , more touched by her father &apos;s words than by any amount of praise from the world .
So , taught by love and sorrow , Jo wrote her little stories , and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her , finding it a very <unk> world to such humble <unk> ; for they were kindly welcomed , and sent home comfortable <unk> to their mother , like dutiful children whom good fortune <unk> .
When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement , Mrs. March feared that Jo would find it difficult to <unk> over it , but her fears were soon set at rest ; for , though Jo looked grave at first , she took it very quietly , and was full of hopes and plans for &quot; the children &quot; before she read the letter twice .
It was a sort of written <unk> , <unk> each glorified the other in <unk> fashion , very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of , for no one had any objection to make .
&quot; You like it , mother ? &quot;
said Jo , as they laid down the closely written sheets , and looked at one another .
&quot; Yes , I hoped it would be so , ever since Amy wrote that she had refused Fred .
I felt sure then that something better than what you call the &apos; mercenary spirit &apos; had come over her , and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day . &quot;
&quot; How sharp you are , Marmee , and how silent !
You never said a word to me . &quot;
&quot; <unk> have need of sharp eyes and <unk> tongues when they have girls to manage .
I was half afraid to put the idea into your head , lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not the <unk> I was ; you may trust me , I &apos;m sober and sensible enough for any one &apos;s _ <unk> _ now . &quot;
&quot; So you are , dear , and I should have made you mine , only I fancied it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved any one else . &quot;
&quot; Now , mother , did you really think I could be so silly and selfish , after I &apos;d refused his love , when it was <unk> , if not best ? &quot;
&quot; I knew you were sincere then , Jo , but lately I have thought that if he came back , and asked again , you might , perhaps , feel like giving another answer .
Forgive me , dear , I can &apos;t help seeing that you are very lonely , and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart ; so I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now . &quot;
&quot; No , mother , it is better as it is , and I &apos;m glad Amy has learned to love him .
But you are right in one thing : I _ am _ lonely , and perhaps if Teddy had tried again , I might have said &apos; Yes , &apos; not because I love him any more , but because I care more to be loved than when he went away . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad of that , Jo , for it shows that you are getting on .
There are plenty to love you , so try to be satisfied with father and mother , sisters and brothers , friends and babies , till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward . &quot;
&quot; <unk> are the _ best _ lovers in the world ; but I don &apos;t mind whispering to Marmee that I &apos;d like to try all kinds .
It &apos;s very curious , but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections , the more I seem to want .
I &apos;d no idea hearts could take in so many ; mine is so <unk> , it never seems full now , and I used to be quite contented with my family .
I don &apos;t understand it . &quot;
&quot; I do ; &quot; and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile , as Jo turned back the leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie .
&quot; It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me ; he isn &apos;t sentimental , doesn &apos;t say much about it , but I see and feel it in all he says and does , and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don &apos;t seem to be the same girl I was .
I never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now , for he lets me read his heart , and I find it full of noble <unk> and hopes and <unk> , and am so proud to know it &apos;s mine .
He says he feels as if he &apos; could make a <unk> voyage now with me <unk> as mate , and lots of love for <unk> . &apos;
I pray he may , and try to be all he <unk> me , for I love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might , and never will desert him , while God lets us be together .
O mother , I never knew how much like heaven this world could be , when two people love and live for one another ! &quot;
&quot; And that &apos;s our cool , <unk> , and worldly Amy !
Truly , love does work <unk> .
How very , very happy they must be ! &quot;
And Jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand , as one might shut the <unk> of a lovely romance , which holds the reader fast till the end comes , and he finds himself alone in the <unk> world again .
By and by Jo roamed away upstairs , for it was rainy , and she could not walk .
A restless spirit possessed her , and the old feeling came again , not bitter as it once was , but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked , the other nothing .
It was not true ; she knew that , and tried to put it away , but the natural <unk> for affection was strong , and Amy &apos;s happiness woke the hungry longing for some one to &quot; love with heart and soul , and cling to while God let them be together . &quot;
Up in the garret , where Jo &apos;s <unk> wanderings ended , stood four little wooden chests in a row , each marked with its owner &apos;s name , and each filled with relics of the <unk> and <unk> ended now for all .
Jo glanced into them , and when she came to her own , leaned her chin on the <unk> , and stared absently at the chaotic collection , till a bundle of old <unk> caught her eye .
She drew them out , turned them over , and <unk> that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke &apos;s .
She had smiled at first , then she looked thoughtful , next sad , and when she came to a little message written in the Professor &apos;s hand , her lips began to <unk> , the books <unk> out of her lap , and she sat looking at the friendly words , as if they took a new meaning , and touched a tender spot in her heart .
&quot; Wait for me , my friend .
I may be a little late , but I shall surely come . &quot;
&quot; Oh , if he only would !
So kind , so good , so patient with me always ; my dear old Fritz , I didn &apos;t value him half enough when I had him , but now how I should love to see him , for every one seems going away from me , and I &apos;m all alone . &quot;
And holding the little paper fast , as if it were a promise yet to be <unk> , Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag-bag , and cried , as if in opposition to the rain <unk> on the roof .
&#91; Illustration : Jo laid her head on a comfortable rag-bag and cried &#93; Was it all <unk> , loneliness , or low spirits ?
or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had <unk> its time as patiently as its <unk> ?
Who shall say ?
&#91; Illustration : A substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
Jo was alone in the twilight , lying on the old sofa , looking at the fire , and thinking .
It was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk ; no one disturbed her , and she used to lie there on Beth &apos;s little red pillow , planning stories , dreaming dreams , or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away .
Her face looked tired , grave , and rather sad ; for to-morrow was her birthday , and she was thinking how fast the years went by , how old she was getting , and how little she seemed to have accomplished .
<unk> twenty-five , and nothing to show for it .
Jo was mistaken in that ; there was a good deal to show , and by and by she saw , and was grateful for it .
&quot; An old maid , that &apos;s what I &apos;m to be .
A literary spinster , with a pen for a spouse , a family of stories for children , and twenty years <unk> a morsel of fame , perhaps ; when , like poor <unk> , I &apos;m old , and can &apos;t enjoy it , solitary , and can &apos;t share it , independent , and don &apos;t need it .
Well , I needn &apos;t be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner ; and , I dare say , old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it ; <unk> &quot; and there Jo sighed , as if the prospect was not inviting .
It seldom is , at first , and thirty seems the end of all things to five-and-twenty ; but it &apos;s not so bad as it looks , and one can get on quite happily if one has something in one &apos;s self to fall back upon .
At twenty-five , girls begin to talk about being old maids , but secretly resolve that they never will be ; at thirty they say nothing about it , but quietly accept the fact , and , if sensible , console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful , happy years , in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully .
Don &apos;t laugh at the <unk> , dear girls , for often very tender , tragical romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns , and many silent sacrifices of youth , health , ambition , love itself , make the faded faces beautiful in God &apos;s sight .
Even the sad , sour sisters should be kindly <unk> with , because they have missed the sweetest part of life , if for no other reason ; and , looking at them with <unk> , not <unk> , girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time ; that rosy cheeks don &apos;t last forever , that silver <unk> will come in the bonnie brown hair , and that , by and by , kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now .
<unk> , which means boys , be <unk> to the old maids , no matter how poor and plain and prim , for the only <unk> worth having is that which is the <unk> to pay <unk> to the old , <unk> the feeble , and serve <unk> , regardless of rank , age , or color .
Just <unk> the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed , but nursed and petted , too often without thanks ; the scrapes they have helped you out of , the &quot; <unk> &quot; they have given you from their small store , the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you , the steps the willing old feet have taken , and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live .
The bright-eyed girls are quick to see such <unk> , and will like you all the better for them ; and if death , almost the only power that can part mother and son , should <unk> you of yours , you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal <unk> from some Aunt <unk> , who has kept the <unk> corner of her lonely old heart for the &quot; the best nevvy in the world . &quot;
Jo must have fallen asleep ( as I dare say my reader has during this little <unk> ) , for suddenly Laurie &apos;s ghost seemed to stand before her , --a substantial , lifelike ghost , <unk> over her , with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn &apos;t like to show it .
But , like Jenny in the <unk> , -- &quot; She could not think it he , &quot; and lay staring up at him in startled silence , till he stooped and kissed her .
Then she knew him , and flew up , crying joyfully , -- &quot; O my Teddy !
O my Teddy ! &quot;
&quot; Dear Jo , you are glad to see me , then ? &quot;
&quot; Glad !
My blessed boy , words can &apos;t express my <unk> .
Where &apos;s Amy ? &quot;
&quot; Your mother has got her down at Meg &apos;s .
We stopped there by the way , and there was no getting my wife out of their <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Your what ? &quot;
cried Jo , for Laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him .
&quot; Oh , the dickens !
now I &apos;ve done it ; &quot; and he looked so guilty that Jo was down upon him like a flash .
&quot; You &apos;ve gone and got married ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , please , but I never will again ; &quot; and he went down upon his knees , with a penitent <unk> of hands , and a face full of mischief , <unk> , and triumph .
&quot; <unk> married ? &quot;
&quot; Very much so , thank you . &quot;
&quot; Mercy on us !
What dreadful thing will you do next ? &quot;
and Jo fell into her seat , with a <unk> .
&quot; A characteristic , but not exactly <unk> , <unk> , &quot; returned Laurie , still in an abject attitude , but beaming with satisfaction .
&quot; What can you expect , when you take one &apos;s breath away , <unk> in like a <unk> , and letting cats out of bags like that ?
Get up , you ridiculous boy , and tell me all about it . &quot;
&quot; Not a word , unless you let me come in my old place , and promise not to barricade . &quot;
Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day , and patted the sofa invitingly , as she said , in a cordial tone , -- &quot; The old pillow is up garret , and we don &apos;t need it now ; so , come and &apos; fess , Teddy . &quot;
&quot; How good it sounds to hear you say &apos; Teddy &apos; !
No one ever calls me that but you ; &quot; and Laurie sat down , with an air of great content .
&quot; What does Amy call you ? &quot;
&quot; My lord . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s like her .
Well , you look it ; &quot; and Jo &apos;s eyes plainly betrayed that she found her boy <unk> than ever .
The pillow was gone , but there _ was _ a barricade , nevertheless , --a natural one , <unk> by time , absence , and change of heart .
Both felt it , and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible <unk> cast a little shadow over them .
It was gone directly , however , for Laurie said , with a vain attempt at dignity , -- &quot; Don &apos;t I look like a married man and the head of a family ? &quot;
&quot; Not a bit , and you never will .
You &apos;ve grown bigger and <unk> , but you are the same <unk> as ever . &quot;
&quot; Now , really , Jo , you ought to treat me with more respect , &quot; began Laurie , who enjoyed it all immensely .
&quot; How can I , when the mere idea of you , married and settled , is so <unk> funny that I can &apos;t keep sober ! &quot;
answered Jo , smiling all over her face , so <unk> that they had another laugh , and then settled down for a good talk , quite in the pleasant old fashion .
&quot; It &apos;s no use your going out in the cold to get Amy , for they are all coming up presently .
I couldn &apos;t wait ; I wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise , and have &apos; first <unk> , &apos; as we used to say when we <unk> about the cream . &quot;
&quot; Of course you did , and spoilt your story by beginning at the wrong end .
Now , start right , and tell me how it all happened ; I &apos;m pining to know . &quot;
&quot; Well , I did it to please Amy , &quot; began Laurie , with a twinkle that made Jo exclaim , -- &quot; <unk> number one ; Amy did it to please you .
Go on , and tell the truth , if you can , sir . &quot;
&quot; Now she &apos;s beginning to <unk> it ; isn &apos;t it jolly to hear her ? &quot;
said Laurie to the fire , and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed .
&quot; It &apos;s all the same , you know , she and I being one .
We planned to come home with the <unk> , a month or more ago , but they suddenly changed their minds , and decided to pass another winter in Paris .
But grandpa wanted to come home ; he went to please me , and I couldn &apos;t let him go alone , neither could I leave Amy ; and Mrs. Carrol had got English notions about <unk> and such nonsense , and wouldn &apos;t let Amy come with us .
So I just settled the difficulty by saying , &apos; Let &apos;s be married , and then we can do as we like . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Of course you did ; you always have things to suit you . &quot;
&quot; Not always ; &quot; and something in Laurie &apos;s voice made Jo say hastily , -- &quot; How did you ever get aunt to agree ? &quot;
&quot; It was hard work ; but , between us , we talked her over , for we had heaps of good <unk> on our side .
There wasn &apos;t time to write and ask leave , but you all liked it , had consented to it by and by , and it was only &apos; taking Time by the fetlock , &apos; as my wife says . &quot;
&quot; Aren &apos;t we proud of those two words , and don &apos;t we like to say them ? &quot;
interrupted Jo , <unk> the fire in her turn , and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to <unk> in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last .
&quot; A trifle , perhaps ; she &apos;s such a captivating little woman I can &apos;t help being proud of her .
Well , then , uncle and aunt were there to play propriety ; we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart , and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all round ; so we did it . &quot;
&quot; When , where , how ? &quot;
asked Jo , in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity , for she could not realize it a particle .
&quot; Six weeks ago , at the American <unk> &apos;s , in Paris ; a very quiet wedding , of course , for even in our happiness we didn &apos;t forget dear little Beth . &quot;
Jo put her hand in his as he said that , and Laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow , which he remembered well .
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you let us know afterward ? &quot;
asked Jo , in a <unk> tone , when they had sat quite still a minute .
&quot; We wanted to surprise you ; we thought we were coming directly home , at first ; but the dear old gentleman , as soon as we were married , found he couldn &apos;t be ready under a month , at least , and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked .
Amy had once called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home , so we went there , and were as happy as people are but once in their lives .
My faith !
wasn &apos;t it love among the roses ! &quot;
Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute , and Jo was glad of it ; for the fact that he told her these things so freely and naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten .
She tried to draw away her hand ; but , as if he guessed the thought that <unk> the <unk> impulse , Laurie held it fast , and said , with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before , -- &quot; Jo , dear , I want to say one thing , and then we &apos;ll put it by forever .
As I told you in my letter , when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me , I never shall stop loving you ; but the love is altered , and I have learned to see that it is better as it is .
Amy and you change places in my heart , that &apos;s all .
I think it was meant to be so , and would have come about naturally , if I had waited , as you tried to make me ; but I never could be patient , and so I got a <unk> .
I was a boy then , <unk> and violent ; and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake .
For it _ was _ one , Jo , as you said , and I found it out , after making a fool of myself .
Upon my word , I was so tumbled up in my mind , at one time , that I didn &apos;t know which I loved best , you or Amy , and tried to love both alike ; but I couldn &apos;t , and when I saw her in Switzerland , everything seemed to clear up all at once .
You both got into your right places , and I felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new ; that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife Amy , and love them both dearly .
Will you believe it , and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll believe it , with all my heart ; but , Teddy , we never can be boy and girl again : the happy old times can &apos;t come back , and we mustn &apos;t expect it .
We are man and woman now , with sober work to do , for <unk> is over , and we must give up <unk> .
I &apos;m sure you feel this ; I see the change in you , and you &apos;ll find it in me .
I shall miss my boy , but I shall love the man as much , and admire him more , because he means to be what I hoped he would .
We can &apos;t be little <unk> any longer , but we will be brother and sister , to love and help one another all our lives , won &apos;t we , Laurie ? &quot;
He did not say a word , but took the hand she offered him , and laid his face down on it for a minute , feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion , there had <unk> a beautiful , strong friendship to bless them both .
Presently Jo said cheerfully , for she didn &apos;t want the coming home to be a sad one , -- &quot; I can &apos;t make it true that you children are really married , and going to set up housekeeping .
Why , it seems only yesterday that I was <unk> Amy &apos;s pinafore , and pulling your hair when you teased .
Mercy me , how time does fly ! &quot;
&quot; As one of the children is older than yourself , you needn &apos;t talk so like a grandma .
I flatter myself I &apos;m a &apos; gentleman <unk> , &apos; as <unk> said of David ; and when you see Amy , you &apos;ll find her rather a precocious infant , &quot; said Laurie , looking amused at her maternal air .
&quot; You may be a little older in years , but I &apos;m ever so much older in feeling , Teddy .
Women always are ; and this last year has been such a hard one that I feel forty . &quot;
&quot; Poor Jo !
we left you to bear it alone , while we went <unk> .
You _ are _ older ; here &apos;s a line , and there &apos;s another ; unless you smile , your eyes look sad , and when I touched the cushion , just now , I found a tear on it .
You &apos;ve had a great deal to bear , and had to bear it all alone .
What a selfish <unk> I &apos;ve been ! &quot;
and Laurie pulled his own hair , with a remorseful look .
But Jo only turned over the <unk> pillow , and answered , in a tone which she tried to make quite cheerful , -- &quot; No , I had father and mother to help me , the dear babies to comfort me , and the thought that you and Amy were safe and happy , to make the troubles here easier to bear .
I _ am _ lonely , sometimes , but I dare say it &apos;s good for me , and-- &quot; &quot; You never shall be again , &quot; broke in Laurie , putting his arm about her , as if to fence out every human ill . &quot; Amy and I can &apos;t get on without you , so you must come and teach &apos; the children &apos; to keep house , and go halves in everything , just as we used to do , and let us pet you , and all be <unk> happy and friendly together . &quot;
&quot; If I shouldn &apos;t be in the way , it would be very pleasant .
I begin to feel quite young already ; for , somehow , all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came .
You always were a comfort , Teddy ; &quot; and Jo leaned her head on his shoulder , just as she did years ago , when Beth lay ill , and Laurie told her to hold on to him .
He looked down at her , wondering if she remembered the time , but Jo was smiling to herself , as if , in truth , her troubles _ had _ all vanished at his coming .
&quot; You are the same Jo still , dropping tears about one minute , and laughing the next .
You look a little wicked now ; what is it , grandma ? &quot;
&quot; I was wondering how you and Amy get on together . &quot;
&quot; Like angels ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , of course , at first ; but which rules ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t mind telling you that she does , now ; at least I let her think so , --it <unk> her , you know .
By and by we shall take turns , for marriage , they say , halves one &apos;s rights and <unk> one &apos;s duties . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll go on as you begin , and Amy will rule you all the days of your life . &quot;
&quot; Well , she does it so <unk> that I don &apos;t think I shall mind much .
She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well ; in fact , I rather like it , for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a <unk> of silk , and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while . &quot;
&quot; That ever I should live to see you a <unk> husband and enjoying it ! &quot;
cried Jo , with uplifted hands .
It was good to see Laurie <unk> his shoulders , and smile with masculine scorn at that <unk> , as he replied , with his &quot; high and mighty &quot; air , -- &quot; Amy is too well-bred for that , and I am not the sort of man to <unk> to it .
My wife and I respect ourselves and one another too much ever to <unk> or quarrel . &quot;
Jo liked that , and thought the new dignity very becoming , but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man , and regret mingled with her pleasure .
&quot; I am sure of that ; Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to .
She is the sun and I the wind , in the fable , and the sun managed the man best , you remember . &quot;
&quot; She can blow him up as well as shine on him , &quot; laughed Laurie .
&quot; Such a lecture as I got at Nice !
I give you my word it was a deal worse than any of your <unk> , --a regular <unk> .
I &apos;ll tell you all about it <unk> , -- _ she _ never will , because , after telling me that she <unk> and was ashamed of me , she lost her heart to the <unk> party and married the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What <unk> !
Well , if she <unk> you , come to me , and I &apos;ll defend you . &quot;
&quot; I look as if I needed it , don &apos;t I ? &quot;
said Laurie , getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the <unk> to the rapturous , as Amy &apos;s voice was heard calling , -- &quot; Where is she ?
Where &apos;s my dear old Jo ? &quot;
In <unk> the whole family , and every one was hugged and kissed all over again , and , after several vain attempts , the three <unk> were set down to be looked at and exulted over .
Mr. Laurence , <unk> and hearty as ever , was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour , for the <unk> seemed to be nearly gone , and the old-fashioned <unk> had received a polish which made it <unk> than ever .
It was good to see him beam at &quot; my children , &quot; as he called the young pair ; it was better still to see Amy pay him the <unk> duty and affection which <unk> won his old heart ; and best of all , to watch Laurie <unk> about the two , as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made .
The minute she put her eyes upon Amy , Meg became conscious that her own dress hadn &apos;t a <unk> air , that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely <unk> by young Mrs. Laurence , and that &quot; her ladyship &quot; was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman .
Jo thought , as she watched the pair , &quot; How well they look together !
I was right , and Laurie has found the beautiful , accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old Jo , and be a pride , not a torment to him . &quot;
Mrs. March and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces , for they saw that their <unk> had done well , not only in worldly things , but the better wealth of love , confidence , and happiness .
For Amy &apos;s face was full of the soft <unk> which <unk> a peaceful heart , her voice had a new tenderness in it , and the cool , prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity , both womanly and <unk> .
No little <unk> <unk> it , and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace , for it <unk> her at once with the <unk> sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become .
&quot; Love has done much for our little girl , &quot; said her mother softly .
&quot; She has had a good example before her all her life , my dear , &quot; Mr. March whispered back , with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him .
Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her &quot; pitty aunty , &quot; but <unk> herself like a <unk> to the wonderful ch� � <unk> full of delightful charms .
Demi paused to consider the new <unk> before he <unk> himself by the rash <unk> of a bribe , which took the <unk> form of a family of wooden bears from <unk> .
A <unk> movement produced an <unk> <unk> , however , for Laurie knew where to have him .
&quot; Young man , when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face : now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman ; &quot; and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul .
&#91; Illustration : The tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew &#93; &quot; <unk> if she ain &apos;t in silk from head to foot ?
<unk> &apos;t it a <unk> &apos; sight to see her <unk> &apos; there as fine as a <unk> , and hear folks calling little Amy , <unk> .
Laurence ? &quot;
muttered old Hannah , who could not resist frequent &quot; <unk> &quot; through the <unk> as she set the table in a most decidedly <unk> manner .
Mercy on us , how they did talk !
first one , then the other , then all burst out together , trying to tell the history of three years in half an hour .
It was fortunate that tea was at hand , to produce a lull and provide refreshment , for they would have been <unk> and faint if they had gone on much longer .
Such a happy procession as <unk> away into the little dining-room !
Mr. March proudly escorted &quot; Mrs. Laurence ; &quot; Mrs. March as proudly leaned on the arm of &quot; my son ; &quot; the old gentleman took Jo , with a whispered &quot; You must be my girl now , &quot; and a glance at the empty corner by the fire , that made Jo whisper back , with trembling lips , &quot; I &apos;ll try to fill her place , sir . &quot;
The twins pranced behind , feeling that the <unk> was at hand , for every one was so busy with the <unk> that they were left to revel at their own sweet will , and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity .
Didn &apos;t they steal <unk> of tea , stuff gingerbread _ <unk> <unk> _ , get a hot <unk> apiece , and , as a crowning <unk> , didn &apos;t they each whisk a captivating little <unk> into their tiny pockets , there to <unk> and <unk> <unk> , teaching them that both human nature and <unk> are frail ?
<unk> with the guilty consciousness of the <unk> <unk> , and fearing that Dodo &apos;s sharp eyes would <unk> the thin <unk> of <unk> and <unk> which hid their <unk> , the little sinners <unk> themselves to &quot; Dranpa , &quot; who hadn &apos;t his spectacles on .
Amy , who was handed about like <unk> , returned to the parlor on Father Laurence &apos;s arm ; the others <unk> off as before , and this arrangement left Jo <unk> .
She did not mind it at the minute , for she <unk> to answer Hannah &apos;s eager inquiry , -- &quot; Will Miss Amy ride in her <unk> ( _ <unk> � _ ) , and use all them lovely silver dishes that &apos;s stored away over <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;t wonder if she drove six white horses , ate off gold plate , and wore diamonds and <unk> every day .
Teddy thinks nothing too good for her , &quot; returned Jo with infinite satisfaction .
&quot; No more there is !
Will you have <unk> or <unk> for breakfast ? &quot;
asked Hannah , who wisely mingled poetry and <unk> .
&quot; I don &apos;t care ; &quot; and Jo shut the door , feeling that food was an <unk> <unk> just then .
She stood a minute looking at the party <unk> above , and , as Demi &apos;s short <unk> legs <unk> up the last <unk> , a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes , as if to find something to <unk> upon , for even Teddy had deserted her .
If she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer , she would not have said to herself , &quot; I &apos;ll weep a little weep when I go to bed ; it won &apos;t do to be dismal now . &quot;
Then she drew her hand over her eyes , --for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was , --and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the <unk> .
She opened it with hospitable haste , and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her ; for there stood a tall , <unk> gentleman , beaming on her from the <unk> like a midnight sun .
&quot; O Mr. Bhaer , I _ am _ so glad to see you ! &quot;
cried Jo , with a <unk> , as if she feared the night would <unk> him up before she could get him in .
&#91; Illustration : O Mr. Bhaer , I am so glad to see you &#93; &quot; And I to see Miss Marsch , --but no , you haf a <unk> &quot; and the Professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them .
&quot; No , we haven &apos;t , only the family .
My sister and friends have just come home , and we are all very happy .
Come in , and make one of us . &quot;
Though a very social man , I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone <unk> away , and come again another day ; but how could he , when Jo shut the door behind him , and <unk> him of his hat ?
Perhaps her face had something to do with it , for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him , and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man , whose welcome far <unk> his <unk> hopes .
&quot; If I shall not be <unk> de <unk> , I will so gladly see them all .
You haf been ill , my friend ? &quot;
He put the question abruptly , for , as Jo hung up his coat , the light fell on her face , and he saw a change in it .
&quot; Not ill , but tired and sorrowful .
We have had trouble since I saw you last . &quot;
&quot; Ah , yes , I know .
My heart was sore for you when I heard that ; &quot; and he shook hands again , with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes , the grasp of the big , warm hand .
&quot; Father , mother , this is my friend , Professor Bhaer , &quot; she said , with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a <unk> and opened the door with a flourish .
If the stranger had had any doubts about his reception , they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received .
Every one greeted him kindly , for Jo &apos;s sake at first , but very soon they liked him for his own .
They could not help it , for he carried the talisman that <unk> all hearts , and these simple people warmed to him at once , feeling even the more friendly because he was poor ; for poverty <unk> those who live above it , and is a sure <unk> to truly hospitable spirits .
Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveller who <unk> at a strange door , and , when it <unk> , finds himself at home .
The children went to him like bees to a <unk> ; and , <unk> themselves on each knee , proceeded to <unk> him by <unk> his pockets , pulling his beard , and <unk> his watch , with <unk> audacity .
The women telegraphed their <unk> to one another , and Mr. March , feeling that he had got a <unk> spirit , opened his <unk> stores for his guest &apos;s benefit , while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk , but said not a word , and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep .
If Jo had not been otherwise engaged , Laurie &apos;s behavior would have amused her ; for a faint <unk> , not of <unk> , but something like suspicion , caused that gentleman to stand <unk> at first , and observe the new-comer with brotherly <unk> .
But it did not last long .
He got interested in spite of himself , and , before he knew it , was drawn into the circle ; for Mr. Bhaer talked well in this <unk> atmosphere , and did himself justice .
He seldom spoke to Laurie , but he looked at him often , and a shadow would pass across his face , as if <unk> his own lost youth , as he watched the young man in his prime .
Then his eye would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it ; but Jo had her own eyes to take care of , and , feeling that they could not be trusted , she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting , like a model maiden aunt .
A <unk> glance now and then <unk> her like <unk> of fresh water after a dusty walk , for the <unk> peeps showed her several <unk> omens .
Mr. Bhaer &apos;s face had lost the absent-minded expression , and looked all alive with interest in the present moment , actually young and handsome , she thought , forgetting to <unk> him with Laurie , as she usually did strange men , to their great <unk> .
Then he seemed quite inspired , though the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , to which the conversation had strayed , might not be considered an <unk> <unk> .
Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument , and thought to herself , as she watched her father &apos;s absorbed face , &quot; How he would enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day ! &quot;
<unk> , Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black , which made him look more like a gentleman than ever .
His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed , but didn &apos;t stay in order long , for , in exciting moments , he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do ; and Jo liked it <unk> erect better than flat , because she thought it gave his fine forehead a <unk> aspect .
Poor Jo , how she did <unk> that plain man , as she sat knitting away so quietly , yet letting nothing escape her , not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold <unk> in his <unk> <unk> !
&quot; Dear old fellow !
He couldn &apos;t have got himself up with more care if he &apos;d been going <unk> , &quot; said Jo to herself ; and then a sudden thought , born of the words , made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball , and go down after it to hide her face .
The <unk> � <unk> did not succeed as well as she expected , however ; for , though just in the act of setting fire to a <unk> , the Professor dropped his <unk> , <unk> speaking , and made a <unk> after the little blue ball .
Of course they <unk> their heads <unk> together , saw stars , and both came up flushed and laughing , without the ball , to <unk> their seats , wishing they had not left them .
Nobody knew where the evening went to ; for Hannah skilfully <unk> the babies at an early hour , nodding like two rosy <unk> , and Mr. Laurence went home to rest .
The others sat round the fire , talking away , utterly regardless of the <unk> of time , till Meg , whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of bed , and Demi set his <unk> <unk> studying the <unk> of <unk> , made a move to go .
&quot; We must have our sing , in the good old way , for we are all together again once more , &quot; said Jo , feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the <unk> emotions of her soul .
They were not _ all _ there .
But no one found the words <unk> or <unk> ; for Beth still seemed among them , a peaceful presence , invisible , but dearer than ever , since death could not break the household <unk> that love made <unk> .
The little chair stood in its old place ; the tidy basket , with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew &quot; so heavy , &quot; was still on its accustomed shelf ; the beloved instrument , seldom touched now , had not been moved ; and above it Beth &apos;s face , serene and smiling , as in the early days , looked down upon them , seeming to say , &quot; Be happy .
I am here . &quot;
&quot; <unk> something , Amy .
Let them hear how much you have improved , &quot; said Laurie , with pardonable pride in his promising pupil .
But Amy whispered , with full eyes , as she <unk> the faded stool , -- &quot; Not to-night , dear .
I can &apos;t show off to-night . &quot;
But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill ; for she sung Beth &apos;s songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught , and touched the listeners &apos; hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her .
The room was very still , when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth &apos;s favorite hymn .
It was hard to say , -- &quot; <unk> <unk> no sorrow that heaven cannot <unk> ; &quot; and Amy leaned against her husband , who stood behind her , feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth &apos;s kiss .
&quot; Now , we must finish with <unk> &apos;s song ; for Mr. Bhaer <unk> that , &quot; said Jo , before the pause grew painful .
And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified &quot; Hem ! &quot;
as he <unk> into the corner where Jo stood , saying , -- &quot; You will sing with me ?
We go excellently well together . &quot;
A pleasing <unk> , by the way ; for Jo had no more idea of music than a <unk> .
But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a whole opera , and warbled away , <unk> regardless of time and tune .
It didn &apos;t much matter ; for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German , heartily and well ; and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum , that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone .
&#91; Illustration : Mr. Bhaer sang heartily &#93; &quot; <unk> <unk> thou the land where the <unk> <unk> , &quot; used to be the Professor &apos;s favorite line , for &quot; <unk> land &quot; meant Germany to him ; but now he seemed to <unk> , with peculiar warmth and melody , upon the words , -- &quot; There , oh there , might I with thee , O my beloved , go ! &quot;
and one <unk> was so <unk> by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land , and would joyfully <unk> <unk> whenever he liked .
The song was considered a great success , and the <unk> retired covered with <unk> .
But a few minutes afterward , he forgot his manners entirely , and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet ; for she had been introduced simply as &quot; my sister , &quot; and no one had called her by her new name since he came .
He forgot himself still further when Laurie said , in his most gracious manner , at parting , -- &quot; My wife and I are very glad to meet you , sir .
Please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way . &quot;
Then the Professor thanked him so heartily , and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction , that Laurie thought him the most delightfully <unk> old fellow he ever met .
&quot; I too shall go ; but I shall gladly come again , if you will gif me leave , dear <unk> , for a little business in the city will keep me here some days . &quot;
He spoke to Mrs. March , but he looked at Jo ; and the mother &apos;s voice gave as cordial an <unk> as did the daughter &apos;s eyes ; for Mrs. March was not so blind to her children &apos;s interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed .
&quot; I suspect that is a wise man , &quot; <unk> Mr. March , with placid satisfaction , from the <unk> , after the last guest had gone .
&quot; I know he is a good one , &quot; added Mrs. March , with decided <unk> , as she wound up the clock .
&quot; I thought you &apos;d like him , &quot; was all Jo said , as she slipped away to her bed .
She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city , and finally decided that he had been <unk> to some great honor , somewhere , but had been too modest to mention the fact .
If she had seen his face when , safe in his own room , he looked at the picture of a severe and <unk> young lady , with a good deal of hair , who appeared to be <unk> darkly into <unk> , it might have thrown some light upon the subject , especially when he turned off the <unk> , and kissed the picture in the dark .
&#91; Illustration : Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother &apos;s lap &#93; <unk> .
MY <unk> AND <unk> .
&quot; Please , Madam Mother , could you lend me my wife for half an hour ?
The <unk> has come , and I &apos;ve been making <unk> of Amy &apos;s Paris <unk> , trying to find some things I want , &quot; said Laurie , coming in the next day to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother &apos;s lap , as if being made &quot; the baby &quot; again .
&quot; <unk> .
Go , dear ; I forget that you have any home but this , &quot; and Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the <unk> , as if asking pardon for her maternal <unk> .
&quot; I shouldn &apos;t have come over if I could have helped it ; but I can &apos;t get on without my little woman any more than a-- &quot; &quot; <unk> can without wind , &quot; suggested Jo , as he paused for a <unk> ; Jo had grown quite her own <unk> self again since Teddy came home .
&quot; <unk> ; for Amy keeps me pointing <unk> <unk> most of the time , with only an occasional <unk> round to the <unk> , and I haven &apos;t had an <unk> spell since I was married ; don &apos;t know anything about the <unk> , but am altogether <unk> and <unk> , hey , my lady ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> weather so far ; I don &apos;t know how long it will last , but I &apos;m not afraid of <unk> , for I &apos;m learning how to sail my ship .
Come home , dear , and I &apos;ll find your <unk> ; I suppose that &apos;s what you are rummaging after among my things .
Men are _ so _ helpless , mother , &quot; said Amy , with a matronly air , which delighted her husband .
&quot; What are you going to do with <unk> after you get settled ? &quot;
asked Jo , <unk> Amy &apos;s cloak as she used to button her <unk> .
&quot; We have our plans ; we don &apos;t mean to say much about them yet , because we are such very new <unk> , but we don &apos;t intend to be idle .
I &apos;m going into business with a devotion that shall delight grandfather , and prove to him that I &apos;m not spoilt .
I need something of the sort to keep me steady .
I &apos;m tired of <unk> , and mean to work like a man . &quot;
&quot; And Amy , what is she going to do ? &quot;
asked Mrs. March , well pleased at Laurie &apos;s decision , and the energy with which he spoke .
&quot; After doing the civil all round , and airing our best bonnet , we shall astonish you by the elegant <unk> of our mansion , the brilliant society we shall draw about us , and the <unk> influence we shall exert over the world at large .
That &apos;s about it , isn &apos;t it , Madame <unk> � <unk> ? &quot;
asked Laurie , with a <unk> look at Amy .
&quot; Time will show .
Come away , <unk> , and don &apos;t shock my family by calling me names before their faces , &quot; answered Amy , resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a _ salon _ as a queen of society .
&quot; How happy those children seem together ! &quot;
observed Mr. March , finding it difficult to become absorbed in his <unk> after the young couple had gone .
&quot; Yes , and I think it will last , &quot; added Mrs. March , with the <unk> expression of a <unk> who has brought a ship safely into <unk> .
&quot; I know it will .
Happy Amy ! &quot;
and Jo sighed , then smiled <unk> as Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient <unk> .
<unk> in the evening , when his mind had been set at rest about the <unk> , Laurie said suddenly to his wife , who was <unk> about , arranging her new art treasures , -- &quot; Mrs.
Laurence . &quot;
&quot; My lord ! &quot;
&quot; That man <unk> to marry our Jo ! &quot;
&quot; I hope so ; don &apos;t you , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Well , my love , I consider him a trump , in the fullest sense of that expressive word , but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer . &quot;
&quot; Now , Laurie , don &apos;t be too fastidious and <unk> .
If they love one another it doesn &apos;t matter a particle how old they are nor how poor .
Women _ never _ should marry for <unk> &quot; Amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her , and looked at her husband , who replied , with <unk> gravity , -- &quot; <unk> not , though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes .
If my memory <unk> me , you once thought it your duty to make a rich match ; that accounts , perhaps , for your <unk> a <unk> like me . &quot;
&quot; O my dearest boy , don &apos;t , don &apos;t say that !
I forgot you were rich when I said &apos; Yes . &apos;
I &apos;d have married you if you hadn &apos;t a penny , and I sometimes wish you _ were _ poor that I might show how much I love you ; &quot; and Amy , who was very dignified in public and very fond in private , gave <unk> proofs of the truth of her words .
&quot; You don &apos;t really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be once , do you ?
It would break my heart if you didn &apos;t believe that I &apos;d gladly pull in the same boat with you , even if you had to get your living by <unk> on the lake . &quot;
&quot; Am I an <unk> and a <unk> ?
How could I think so , when you refused a richer man for me , and won &apos;t let me give you half I want to now , when I have the right ?
Girls do it every day , poor things , and are taught to think it is their only <unk> ; but you had better lessons , and , though I trembled for you at one time , I was not disappointed , for the daughter was true to the mother &apos;s teaching .
I told mamma so yesterday , and she looked as glad and grateful as if I &apos;d given her a check for a million , to be spent in charity .
You are not listening to my moral remarks , Mrs. Laurence ; &quot; and Laurie paused , for Amy &apos;s eyes had an absent look , though fixed upon his face .
&quot; Yes , I am , and admiring the <unk> in your chin at the same time .
I don &apos;t wish to make you vain , but I must confess that I &apos;m prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money .
Don &apos;t laugh , but your nose is _ such _ a comfort to me ; &quot; and Amy softly caressed the <unk> feature with artistic satisfaction .
Laurie had received many compliments in his life , but never one that suited him better , as he plainly showed , though he did laugh at his wife &apos;s peculiar taste , while she said slowly , -- &quot; May I ask you a question , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Of course you may . &quot;
&quot; Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr.
Bhaer ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , that &apos;s the trouble , is it ?
I thought there was something in the <unk> that didn &apos;t suit you .
Not being a dog in the <unk> , but the happiest fellow alive , I assure you I can dance at Jo &apos;s wedding with a heart as light as my heels .
Do you doubt it , my darling ? &quot;
Amy looked up at him , and was satisfied ; her last little jealous fear vanished forever , and she thanked him , with a face full of love and confidence .
&quot; I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor .
Couldn &apos;t we <unk> a rich relation , who shall <unk> die out there in Germany , and leave him a tidy little fortune ? &quot;
said Laurie , when they began to pace up and down the long drawing-room , arm-in-arm , as they were fond of doing , in memory of the chateau garden .
&#91; Illustration : They began to pace up and down &#93; &quot; Jo would find us out , and spoil it all ; she is very proud of him , just as he is , and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing . &quot;
&quot; Bless her dear heart !
she won &apos;t think so when she has a literary husband , and a dozen little <unk> and <unk> to support .
We won &apos;t interfere now , but watch our chance , and do them a good turn in spite of themselves .
I owe Jo for a part of my education , and she <unk> in people &apos;s paying their honest debts , so I &apos;ll get round her in that way . &quot;
&quot; How delightful it is to be able to help others , isn &apos;t it ?
That was always one of my dreams , to have the power of giving freely ; and , thanks to you , the dream has come true . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
we &apos;ll do quantities of good , won &apos;t we ?
There &apos;s one sort of poverty that I particularly like to help .
<unk> <unk> get taken care of , but poor <unk> fare badly , because they won &apos;t ask , and people don &apos;t dare to offer charity ; yet there are a <unk> ways of helping them , if one only knows how to do it so <unk> that it does not <unk> .
I must say , I like to serve a <unk> gentleman better than a <unk> <unk> ; I suppose it &apos;s wrong , but I do , though it is harder . &quot;
&quot; Because it takes a gentleman to do it , &quot; added the other member of the domestic admiration society .
&quot; Thank you , I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t deserve that pretty compliment .
But I was going to say that while I was <unk> about abroad , I saw a good many <unk> young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices , and <unk> real hardships , that they might realize their dreams .
<unk> fellows , some of them , working like heroes , poor and <unk> , but so full of courage , patience , and ambition , that I was ashamed of myself , and longed to give them a right good lift .
Those are people whom it &apos;s a satisfaction to help , for if they &apos;ve got genius , it &apos;s an honor to be allowed to serve them , and not let it be lost or <unk> for want of <unk> to keep the pot <unk> ; if they haven &apos;t , it &apos;s a pleasure to comfort the poor souls , and keep them from despair when they find it out . &quot;
&quot; Yes , indeed ; and there &apos;s another class who can &apos;t ask , and who suffer in silence .
I know something of it , for I belonged to it before you made a princess of me , as the king does the <unk> in the old story .
<unk> girls have a hard time , Laurie , and often have to see youth , health , and precious opportunities go by , just for want of a little help at the right minute .
People have been very kind to me ; and whenever I see girls struggling along , as we used to do , I want to put out my hand and help them , as I was helped . &quot;
&quot; And so you shall , like an angel as you are ! &quot;
cried Laurie , resolving , with a glow of <unk> <unk> , to found and <unk> an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic <unk> .
&quot; Rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves , or let their money <unk> for others to waste .
It &apos;s not half so sensible to leave <unk> when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive , and enjoy making one &apos;s <unk> happy with it .
We &apos;ll have a good time ourselves , and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a generous taste .
Will you be a little <unk> , going about <unk> a big basket of comforts , and filling it up with good <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; With all my heart , if you will be a brave St. <unk> , stopping , as you ride gallantly through the world , to share your cloak with the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a bargain , and we shall get the best of it ! &quot;
So the young pair shook hands upon it , and then <unk> happily on again , feeling that their pleasant home was more <unk> because they hoped to brighten other homes , believing that their own feet would walk more <unk> along the <unk> path before them , if they smoothed rough ways for other feet , and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; <unk> .
<unk> AND <unk> .
I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble <unk> of the March family , without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious and important members of it .
Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of discretion ; for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights , and get them , too , which is more than many of their elders do .
If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoilt by <unk> , it was these <unk> <unk> .
Of course they were the most remarkable children ever born , as will be shown when I mention that they walked at eight months , talked <unk> at twelve months , and at two years they took their places at table , and behaved with a propriety which charmed all <unk> .
At three , Daisy demanded a &quot; <unk> , &quot; and actually made a bag with four stitches in it ; she likewise set up housekeeping in the <unk> , and managed a <unk> <unk> with a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah &apos;s eyes , while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather , who invented a new <unk> of teaching the <unk> by <unk> the letters with his arms and legs , thus <unk> gymnastics for head and heels .
The boy early <unk> a <unk> genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother , for he tried to imitate every <unk> he saw , and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition , with his &quot; <unk> , &quot; --a mysterious <unk> of string , chairs , <unk> , and <unk> , for <unk> to go &quot; wound and wound ; &quot; also a basket hung over the back of a big chair , in which he <unk> tried to <unk> his too confiding sister , who , with feminine devotion , allowed her little head to be <unk> till rescued , when the young <unk> indignantly <unk> , &quot; Why , marmar , <unk> &apos;s my <unk> , and me &apos;s trying to pull her up . &quot;
Though utterly unlike in character , the twins got on remarkably well together , and seldom <unk> more than <unk> a day .
Of course , Demi tyrannized over Daisy , and gallantly defended her from every other <unk> ; while Daisy made a <unk> of herself , and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world .
A rosy , <unk> , sunshiny little soul was Daisy , who found her way to everybody &apos;s heart , and nestled there .
One of the captivating children , who seem made to be kissed and cuddled , adorned and adored like little <unk> , and produced for general <unk> on all festive occasions .
Her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small <unk> had not kept her delightfully human .
It was all fair weather in her world , and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little <unk> to look out , and say , no matter whether it <unk> or shone , &quot; Oh , pitty day , oh , pitty day ! &quot;
Every one was a friend , and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> became faithful <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : Me loves evvybody &#93; &quot; Me loves evvybody , &quot; she once said , opening her arms , with her <unk> in one hand , and her <unk> in the other , as if eager to embrace and <unk> the whole world .
As she grew , her mother began to feel that the Dove-cote would be blest by the presence of an <unk> as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home , and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had <unk> an angel <unk> .
Her grandfather often called her &quot; Beth , &quot; and her grandmother watched over her with <unk> devotion , as if trying to atone for some past mistake , which no eye but her own could see .
Demi , like a true Yankee , was of an inquiring turn , wanting to know everything , and often getting much disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual &quot; What for ? &quot;
He also possessed a philosophic bent , to the great delight of his grandfather , who used to hold <unk> <unk> with him , in which the precocious pupil occasionally <unk> his teacher , to the <unk> satisfaction of the <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : What makes my legs go , dranpa ? &#93;
&quot; What makes my legs go , dranpa ? &quot;
asked the young <unk> , surveying those active <unk> of his frame with a meditative air , while resting after a <unk> frolic one night .
&quot; It &apos;s your little mind , Demi , &quot; replied the <unk> , stroking the yellow head respectfully .
&quot; What is a little mine ? &quot;
&quot; It is something which makes your body move , as the spring made the <unk> go in my watch when I showed it to you . &quot;
&quot; <unk> me ; I want to see it go wound . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t do that any more than you could open the watch .
God winds you up , and you go till He stops you . &quot;
&quot; Does I ? &quot;
and Demi &apos;s brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought .
&quot; Is I wounded up like the watch ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; but I can &apos;t show you how ; for it is done when we don &apos;t see . &quot;
Demi felt of his back , as if expecting to find it like that of the watch , and then gravely <unk> , -- &quot; I <unk> <unk> does it when I &apos;s asleep . &quot;
A careful explanation followed , to which he listened so <unk> that his anxious grandmother said , -- &quot; My dear , do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby ?
He &apos;s getting great <unk> over his eyes , and learning to ask the most <unk> questions . &quot;
&quot; If he is old enough to ask the questions he is old enough to receive true answers .
I am not putting the thoughts into his head , but helping him <unk> those already there .
These children are wiser than we are , and I have no doubt the boy <unk> every word I have said to him .
Now , Demi , tell me where you keep your mind ? &quot;
If the boy had replied like <unk> , &quot; By the gods , <unk> , I cannot tell , &quot; his grandfather would not have been surprised ; but when , after standing a moment on one leg , like a meditative young <unk> , he answered , in a tone of calm conviction , &quot; In my little <unk> , &quot; the old gentleman could only join in grandma &apos;s laugh , and <unk> the class in <unk> .
There might have been cause for maternal anxiety , if Demi had not given <unk> proofs that he was a true boy , as well as a budding <unk> ; for , often , after a discussion which caused Hannah to <unk> , with <unk> nods , &quot; That child ain &apos;t long for this world , &quot; he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with which dear , dirty , naughty little rascals <unk> and delight their parents &apos; souls .
Meg made many moral rules , and tried to keep them ; but what mother was ever <unk> against the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , or the tranquil audacity of the <unk> men and women who so early show themselves accomplished <unk> <unk> ?
&quot; No more raisins , Demi , they &apos;ll make you sick , &quot; says mamma to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with <unk> regularity on <unk> day .
&quot; Me likes to be sick . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to have you , so run away and help Daisy make <unk> . &quot;
He reluctantly <unk> , but his wrongs <unk> upon his spirit ; and , by and by , when an opportunity comes to <unk> them , he <unk> mamma by a <unk> bargain .
&quot; Now you have been good children , and I &apos;ll play anything you like , &quot; says Meg , as she <unk> her <unk> <unk> upstairs , when the pudding is safely <unk> in the pot .
&quot; Truly , marmar ? &quot;
<unk> Demi , with a brilliant idea in his <unk> head .
&quot; Yes , truly ; anything you say , &quot; <unk> the short-sighted <unk> , preparing herself to sing &quot; The Three Little <unk> &quot; half a dozen times over , or to take her family to &quot; <unk> a penny <unk> , &quot; regardless of wind or <unk> .
But Demi corners her by the cool reply , -- &quot; Then we &apos;ll go and eat up all the raisins . &quot;
Aunt Dodo was chief <unk> and _ <unk> _ of both children , and the <unk> turned the little house topsy-turvy .
Aunt Amy was as yet only a name to them , Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory , but Aunt Dodo was a living <unk> , and they made the most of her , for which compliment she was deeply grateful .
But when Mr. Bhaer came , Jo neglected her <unk> , and dismay and <unk> fell upon their little souls .
Daisy , who was fond of going about <unk> kisses , lost her best <unk> and became <unk> ; Demi , with <unk> <unk> , soon discovered that Dodo liked to play with &quot; the <unk> &quot; better than she did with him ; but , though hurt , he concealed his anguish , for he hadn &apos;t the heart to insult a <unk> who kept a mine of <unk> in his <unk> , and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent <unk> .
Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as <unk> ; but Demi didn &apos;t see it in that light , and continued to <unk> the &quot; <unk> &quot; with pensive <unk> , while Daisy <unk> her small affections upon him at the third call , and considered his shoulder her <unk> , his arm her refuge , his gifts treasures of <unk> worth .
<unk> are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young <unk> of ladies whom they honor with their regard ; but this <unk> <unk> sits <unk> upon them , and does not deceive anybody a particle .
Mr. Bhaer &apos;s devotion was sincere , however likewise effective , --for <unk> is the best <unk> in love as in law ; he was one of the men who are at home with children , and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one .
His business , whatever it was , <unk> him from day to day , but evening seldom failed to bring him out to <unk> , he always asked for Mr. March , so I suppose _ he _ was the attraction .
The excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was , and revelled in long <unk> with the <unk> spirit , till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him .
Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study , astonished by the spectacle that met his eye .
<unk> upon the floor lay Mr. March , with his respectable legs in the air , and beside him , likewise <unk> , was Demi , trying to imitate the attitude with his own short , <unk> legs , both <unk> so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators , till Mr. Bhaer laughed his <unk> laugh , and Jo cried out , with a scandalized face , -- &quot; Father , father , here &apos;s the Professor ! &quot;
Down went the black legs and up came the gray head , as the <unk> said , with <unk> dignity , -- &quot; Good evening , Mr. Bhaer .
<unk> me for a moment ; we are just finishing our lesson .
Now , Demi , make the letter and tell its name . &quot;
&quot; I knows him ! &quot;
and , after a few <unk> efforts , the red legs took the shape of a pair of <unk> , and the intelligent pupil triumphantly <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s a We , dranpa , it &apos;s a We ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Dranpa , it &apos;s a We &#93; &quot; He &apos;s a born Weller , &quot; laughed Jo , as her <unk> gathered himself up , and her nephew tried to stand on his head , as the only <unk> of <unk> his satisfaction that school was over .
&quot; What have you been at to-day , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
asked Mr. Bhaer , picking up the <unk> .
&quot; Me went to see little Mary . &quot;
&quot; And what did you there ? &quot;
&quot; I kissed her , &quot; began Demi , with artless frankness .
&quot; Prut !
thou <unk> early .
What did the little Mary say to that ? &quot;
asked Mr. Bhaer , <unk> to confess the young sinner , who stood upon his knee , <unk> the <unk> .
&quot; Oh , she liked it , and she kissed me , and I liked it .
_ Don &apos;t _ little boys like little girls ? &quot;
added Demi , with his mouth full , and an air of <unk> satisfaction .
&quot; You precocious <unk> !
Who put that into your head ? &quot;
said Jo , enjoying the innocent <unk> as much as the Professor .
&quot; &apos; <unk> &apos;t in mine head ; it &apos;s in mine <unk> , &quot; answered <unk> Demi , putting out his tongue , with a <unk> on it , thinking she alluded to <unk> , not ideas .
&quot; Thou <unk> save some for the little friend : <unk> to the sweet , <unk> ; &quot; and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some , with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the <unk> drunk by the gods .
Demi also saw the smile , was impressed by it , and <unk> inquired , -- &quot; Do great boys like great girls , too , &apos; <unk> ? &quot;
Like young Washington , Mr. Bhaer &quot; couldn &apos;t tell a lie ; &quot; so he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes , in a tone that made Mr. March put down his <unk> , glance at Jo &apos;s <unk> face , and then <unk> into his chair , looking as if the &quot; precocious <unk> &quot; had put an idea into _ his _ head that was both sweet and sour .
Why Dodo , when she caught him in the china-closet half an hour afterward , nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace , instead of shaking him for being there , and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big <unk> of bread and jelly , remained one of the <unk> over which Demi puzzled his small wits , and was forced to leave <unk> forever .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades &#93; <unk> .
UNDER THE <unk> .
While Laurie and Amy were taking <unk> <unk> over velvet <unk> , as they set their house in order , and planned a blissful future , Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort , along muddy <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
&quot; I always do take a walk toward evening , and I don &apos;t know why I should give it up , just because I often happen to meet the Professor on his way out , &quot; said Jo to herself , after two or three <unk> ; for , though there were two <unk> to Meg &apos;s , <unk> one she took she was sure to meet him , either going or returning .
He was always walking rapidly , and never seemed to see her till quite close , when he would look as if his short-sighted eyes had failed to <unk> the approaching lady till that moment .
Then , if she was going to Meg &apos;s , he always had something for the babies ; if her face was turned homeward , he had merely strolled down to see the river , and was just about returning , unless they were tired of his frequent calls .
Under the circumstances , what could Jo do but greet him <unk> , and invite him in ?
If she _ was _ tired of his visits , she concealed her <unk> with perfect skill , and took care that there should be coffee for supper , &quot; as <unk> mean Mr. <unk> &apos;t like tea . &quot;
By the second week , every one knew perfectly well what was going on , yet every one tried to look as if they were <unk> to the changes in Jo &apos;s face .
They never asked why she sang about her work , did up her hair three times a day , and got so <unk> with her evening exercise ; and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer , while talking philosophy with the father , was giving the daughter lessons in love .
Jo couldn &apos;t even lose her heart in a decorous manner , but <unk> tried to <unk> her feelings ; and , failing to do so , led a somewhat agitated life .
She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for <unk> , after her many and <unk> <unk> of independence .
Laurie was her especial dread ; but , thanks to the new <unk> , he behaved with praiseworthy propriety , never called Mr. Bhaer &quot; a capital old fellow &quot; in public , never alluded , in the <unk> manner , to Jo &apos;s improved appearance , or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor &apos;s hat on the Marches &apos; <unk> nearly every evening .
But he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of plate , with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate <unk> .
For a fortnight , the Professor came and went with <unk> regularity ; then he stayed away for three whole days , and made no sign , --a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober , and Jo to become pensive , at first , and <unk> for romance ! <unk> cross .
&quot; <unk> , I dare say , and gone home as suddenly as he came .
It &apos;s nothing to me , of course ; but I _ should _ think he would have come and bid us good-by , like a gentleman , &quot; she said to herself , with a despairing look at the gate , as she put on her things for the <unk> walk , one dull afternoon .
&quot; You &apos;d better take the little umbrella , dear ; it looks like rain , &quot; said her mother , observing that she had on her new bonnet , but not <unk> to the fact .
&quot; Yes , Marmee ; do you want anything in town ?
I &apos;ve got to run in and get some paper , &quot; returned Jo , pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother .
&quot; Yes ; I want some <unk> <unk> , a paper of number nine needles , and two <unk> of narrow lavender ribbon .
Have you got your thick boots on , and something warm under your cloak ? &quot;
&quot; I believe so , &quot; answered Jo absently .
&quot; If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer , bring him home to tea .
I quite long to see the dear man , &quot; added Mrs. March .
Jo heard _ that _ , but made no answer , except to kiss her mother , and walk rapidly away , thinking with a glow of gratitude , in spite of her <unk> , -- &quot; How good she is to me !
What _ do _ girls do who haven &apos;t any mothers to help them through their troubles ? &quot;
The <unk> stores were not down among the <unk> , banks , and <unk> <unk> , where gentlemen most do <unk> ; but Jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single <unk> , <unk> along as if waiting for some one , examining <unk> <unk> in one window and <unk> of <unk> in another with most <unk> interest ; tumbling over <unk> , being <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> by busy men who looked as if they wondered &quot; how the deuce she got there . &quot;
A drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from <unk> hopes to <unk> ribbons ; for the drops continued to fall , and , being a woman as well as a lover , she felt that , though it was too late to save her heart , she might her bonnet .
Now she remembered the little umbrella , which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off ; but regret was <unk> , and nothing could be done but borrow one or <unk> to a <unk> .
She looked up at the <unk> sky , down at the crimson bow already <unk> with black , forward along the muddy street , then one long , <unk> look behind , at a certain <unk> <unk> , with &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &amp; <unk> . &quot; over the door , and said to herself , with a <unk> reproachful air , -- &quot; It <unk> me right !
What business had I to put on all my best things and come philandering down here , hoping to see the Professor ?
Jo , I &apos;m ashamed of you !
No , you shall _ not _ go there to borrow an umbrella , or find out where he is , from his friends .
You shall <unk> away , and do your errands in the rain ; and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet , it &apos;s no more than you deserve .
Now then ! &quot;
With that she rushed across the street so <unk> that she <unk> escaped <unk> from a passing <unk> , and <unk> herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman , who said , &quot; I beg pardon , ma &apos;am , &quot; and looked mortally offended .
<unk> daunted , Jo <unk> herself , spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons , and , putting temptation behind her , hurried on , with increasing <unk> about the <unk> , and much <unk> of <unk> overhead .
The fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained <unk> above the <unk> bonnet , attracted her attention ; and , looking up , she saw Mr. Bhaer looking down .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> up she saw Mr. Bhaer &#93; &quot; I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many <unk> , and so fast through much mud .
What do you down here , my friend ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m shopping . &quot;
Mr. Bhaer smiled , as he glanced from the <unk> on one side , to the <unk> hide and <unk> <unk> on the other ; but he only said <unk> , -- &quot; You haf no umbrella .
May I go also , and take for you the bundles ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , thank you . &quot;
Jo &apos;s cheeks were as red as her ribbon , and she wondered what he thought of her ; but she didn &apos;t care , for in a minute she found herself walking away arm-in-arm with her Professor , feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy , that the world was all right again , and that one thoroughly happy woman was <unk> through the wet that day .
&quot; We thought you had gone , &quot; said Jo hastily , for she knew he was looking at her .
Her bonnet wasn &apos;t big enough to hide her face , and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly .
&quot; Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me ? &quot;
he asked so <unk> that she felt as if she had insulted him by the <unk> , and answered heartily , -- &quot; No , _ I _ didn &apos;t ; I knew you were busy about your own affairs , but we rather missed you , <unk> and mother especially . &quot;
&quot; And you ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m always glad to see you , sir . &quot;
In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm , Jo made it rather cool , and the <unk> little <unk> at the end seemed to <unk> the Professor , for his smile vanished , as he said gravely , -- &quot; I thank you , and come one time more before I go . &quot;
&quot; You _ are _ going , then ? &quot;
&quot; I haf no longer any business here ; it is done . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , I hope ? &quot;
said Jo , for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his .
&quot; I ought to think so , for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make my bread and gif my <unk> <unk> <unk> much help . &quot;
&quot; Tell me , please !
I like to know all about <unk> boys , &quot; said Jo eagerly .
&quot; That is so kind , I gladly tell you .
My friends find for me a place in a college , where I teach as at home , and earn enough to make the way smooth for Franz and Emil .
For this I should be grateful , should I not ? &quot;
&quot; Indeed you should .
How splendid it will be to have you doing what you like , and be able to see you often , and the boys ! &quot;
cried Jo , clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help <unk> .
&quot; Ah !
but we shall not meet often , I fear ; this place is at the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; So far away ! &quot;
and Jo left her skirts to their fate , as if it didn &apos;t matter now what became of her clothes or herself .
Mr. Bhaer could read several languages , but he had not learned to read women yet .
He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well , and was , therefore , much amazed by the <unk> of voice , face , and manner , which she showed him in <unk> <unk> that day , for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour .
When she met him she looked surprised , though it was impossible to help <unk> that she had come for that express purpose .
When he offered her his arm , she took it with a look that filled him with delight ; but when he asked if she missed him , she gave such a chilly , formal reply that despair fell upon him .
On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands : was the joy all for the boys ?
Then , on hearing his <unk> , she said , &quot; So far away ! &quot;
in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a <unk> of hope ; but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing , like one entirely absorbed in the matter , -- &quot; Here &apos;s the place for my errands ; will you come in ?
It won &apos;t take long . &quot;
Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping <unk> , and particularly wished to <unk> her escort with the <unk> and <unk> with which she would <unk> the business .
But , <unk> to the flutter she was in , everything went amiss ; she upset the <unk> of needles , forgot the <unk> was to be &quot; <unk> &quot; till it was cut off , gave the wrong change , and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon at the <unk> <unk> .
Mr. Bhaer stood by , watching her blush and blunder ; and , as he watched , his own bewilderment seemed to <unk> , for he was beginning to see that on some occasions women , like dreams , go by <unk> .
When they came out , he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect , and <unk> through the <unk> as if he rather enjoyed it , on the whole .
&quot; <unk> we not do a little what you call shopping for the babies , and haf a farewell feast to-night if I go for my last call at your so pleasant home ? &quot;
he asked , stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers .
&quot; What will we buy ? &quot;
said Jo , <unk> the latter part of his speech , and <unk> the mingled <unk> with an <unk> of delight as they went in .
&quot; May they haf <unk> and <unk> ? &quot;
asked Mr. Bhaer , with a paternal air .
&quot; They eat them when they can get them . &quot;
&quot; Do you care for nuts ? &quot;
&quot; Like a squirrel . &quot;
&quot; <unk> grapes ; yes , we shall surely drink to the <unk> in those ? &quot;
Jo frowned upon that piece of <unk> , and asked why he didn &apos;t buy a frail of <unk> , a <unk> of raisins , and a bag of <unk> , and done with it ?
<unk> Mr. Bhaer <unk> her purse , produced his own , and finished the <unk> by buying several <unk> of grapes , a pot of rosy <unk> , and a pretty jar of honey , to be regarded in the light of a <unk> .
Then , <unk> his pockets with the knobby bundles , and giving her the flowers to hold , he put up the old umbrella , and they travelled on again .
&quot; Miss Marsch , I haf a great favor to ask of you , &quot; began the Professor , after a <unk> promenade of half a <unk> .
&quot; Yes , sir ; &quot; and Jo &apos;s heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it .
&quot; I am bold to say it in spite of the rain , because so short a time remains to me . &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; &quot; and Jo nearly crushed the small <unk> with the sudden squeeze she gave it .
&quot; I wish to get a little dress for my Tina , and I am too stupid to go alone .
Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; &quot; and Jo felt as calm and cool , all of a sudden , as if she had <unk> into a <unk> .
&quot; Perhaps also a shawl for Tina &apos;s mother , she is so poor and sick , and the husband is such a care .
Yes , yes , a thick , warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll do it with pleasure , Mr. Bhaer .
I &apos;m going very fast and he &apos;s getting dearer every minute , &quot; added Jo to herself ; then , with a mental shake , she entered into the business with an energy which was pleasant to behold .
Mr. Bhaer left it all to her , so she chose a pretty gown for Tina , and then ordered out the <unk> .
The <unk> , being a married man , <unk> to take an interest in the couple , who appeared to be shopping for their family .
&quot; Your lady may prefer this ; it &apos;s a superior article , a most desirable color , quite <unk> and <unk> , &quot; he said , shaking out a comfortable gray shawl , and throwing it over Jo &apos;s shoulders .
&#91; Illustration : Does this suit you , Mr.
Bhaer ? &#93;
&quot; Does this suit you , Mr.
Bhaer ? &quot;
she asked , turning her back to him , and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face .
&quot; <unk> well ; we will haf it , &quot; answered the Professor , smiling to himself as he paid for it , while Jo continued to rummage the <unk> like a confirmed <unk> .
&quot; Now shall we go home ? &quot;
he asked , as if the words were very pleasant to him .
&quot; Yes ; it &apos;s late , and I &apos;m _ so _ tired . &quot;
Jo &apos;s voice was more pathetic than she knew ; for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out , the world grew muddy and miserable again , and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold , her head ached , and that her heart was <unk> than the former , <unk> of pain than the latter .
Mr. Bhaer was going away ; he only cared for her as a friend ; it was all a mistake , and the sooner it was over the better .
With this idea in her head , she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the <unk> flew out of the pot and were badly damaged .
&quot; This is not our <unk> , &quot; said the Professor , waving the loaded <unk> away , and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers .
&quot; I beg your pardon , I didn &apos;t see the name <unk> .
Never mind , I can walk .
I &apos;m used to <unk> in the mud , &quot; returned Jo , winking hard , because she would have died rather than <unk> wipe her eyes .
Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks , though she turned her head away ; the sight seemed to touch him very much , for , suddenly stooping down , he asked in a tone that meant a great deal , -- &quot; Heart &apos;s dearest , why do you cry ? &quot;
Now , if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she wasn &apos;t crying , had a cold in her head , or told any other feminine fib proper to the occasion ; instead of which that <unk> creature answered , with an irrepressible sob , -- &quot; Because you are going away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , <unk> Gott , that is _ so _ good ! &quot;
cried Mr. Bhaer , <unk> to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles .
&quot; Jo , I haf nothing but much love to gif you ; I came to see if you could care for it , and I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend .
Am I ?
Can you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz ? &quot;
he added , all in one breath .
&quot; Oh , yes ! &quot;
said Jo ; and he was quite satisfied , for she folded both hands over his arm , and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him , even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella , if he carried it .
It was certainly <unk> under <unk> , for , even if he had desired to do so , Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees , on account of the mud ; neither could he offer Jo his hand , except <unk> , for both were full ; much less could he indulge in tender <unk> in the open street , though he was near it : so the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her , with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little <unk> in the drops that sparkled on his beard .
If he had not loved Jo very much , I don &apos;t think he could have done it _ then _ , for she looked far from lovely , with her skirts in a <unk> state , her rubber boots <unk> to the ankle , and her bonnet a ruin .
Fortunately , Mr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living , and she found him more &quot; <unk> &quot; than ever , though his <unk> was quite <unk> with the little <unk> <unk> <unk> upon his shoulders ( for he held the umbrella all over Jo ) , and every finger of his gloves needed mending .
<unk> probably thought them a pair of harmless <unk> , for they entirely forgot to <unk> a &apos; <unk> , and strolled leisurely along , <unk> of <unk> dusk and fog .
Little they cared what anybody thought , for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life , the <unk> moment which <unk> youth on the old , beauty on the plain , wealth on the poor , and gives human hearts a <unk> of heaven .
The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom , and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss ; while Jo <unk> beside him , feeling as if her place had always been there , and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot .
Of course , she was the first to <unk> , I mean , for the <unk> remarks which followed her impetuous &quot; Oh , yes ! &quot;
were not of a <unk> or <unk> character .
&quot; Friedrich , why didn &apos;t you-- &quot; &quot; Ah , heaven , she <unk> me the name that no one speaks since Minna died ! &quot;
cried the Professor , pausing in a <unk> to regard her with grateful delight .
&quot; I always call you so to <unk> forgot ; but I won &apos;t , unless you like it . &quot;
&quot; Like it ?
it is more sweet to me than I can tell .
Say &apos; thou , &apos; also , and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine . &quot;
&quot; Isn &apos;t &apos; thou &apos; a little sentimental ? &quot;
asked Jo , privately thinking it a lovely <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ?
Yes .
Thank Gott , we Germans believe in sentiment , and keep ourselves young <unk> it .
Your English &apos; you &apos; is so cold , say &apos; thou , &apos; heart &apos;s dearest , it means so much to me , &quot; pleaded Mr. Bhaer , more like a romantic <unk> than a grave <unk> .
&quot; Well , then , why didn &apos;t thou tell me all this sooner ? &quot;
asked Jo <unk> .
&quot; Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart , and I so gladly will , because thou must take care of it <unk> .
See , then , my Jo , <unk> , the dear , funny little name ! --I had a wish to tell something the day I said good-by , in New York ; but I thought the handsome friend was <unk> to thee , and so I spoke not .
<unk> thou have said &apos; Yes , &apos; then , if I _ had _ spoken ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know ; I &apos;m afraid not , for I didn &apos;t have any heart just then . &quot;
&quot; Prut !
that I do not believe .
It was asleep till the fairy <unk> came through the wood , and waked it up .
Ah , well , &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> ist die <unk> ; &apos; but that I should not expect . &quot;
&quot; Yes , the first love _ is _ the best ; so be contented , for I never had another .
Teddy was only a boy , and soon got over his little fancy , &quot; said Jo , anxious to correct the Professor &apos;s mistake .
&quot; Good !
then I shall rest happy , and be sure that thou <unk> me all .
I haf waited so long , I am grown selfish , as thou <unk> find , <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I like that , &quot; cried Jo , delighted with her new name .
&quot; Now tell me what brought you , at last , just when I most wanted you ? &quot;
&quot; This ; &quot; and Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his <unk> .
Jo <unk> it , and looked much abashed , for it was one of her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry , which <unk> for her sending it an occasional attempt .
&quot; How could that bring you ? &quot;
she asked , wondering what he meant .
&quot; I found it by chance ; I knew it by the names and the <unk> , and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me .
<unk> and find him ; I will see that you go not in the wet . &quot;
Jo obeyed , and hastily <unk> through the lines which she had <unk> &quot; IN THE <unk> .
&quot; Four little chests all in a row , <unk> with dust , and worn by time , All <unk> and filled , long ago , By children now in their prime .
Four little keys hung side by side , With faded ribbons , brave and gay When fastened there , with childish pride , Long ago , on a rainy day .
Four little names , one on each lid , <unk> out by a boyish hand , And <unk> there <unk> hid <unk> of the happy band Once playing here , and pausing <unk> To hear the sweet refrain , That came and went on the roof <unk> , In the falling summer rain .
&quot; &apos; Meg &apos; on the first lid , smooth and fair .
I look in with loving eyes , For folded here , with well-known care , A <unk> gathering lies , The record of a peaceful life , -- <unk> to gentle child and girl , A bridal gown , lines to a wife , A tiny shoe , a baby curl .
No <unk> in this first chest remain , For all are carried away , In their old age , to join again In another small Meg &apos;s play .
Ah , happy mother !
well I know You hear , like a sweet refrain , <unk> ever soft and low In the falling summer rain .
&quot; &apos; Jo &apos; on the next lid , <unk> and worn , And within a <unk> store Of <unk> dolls , of <unk> torn , <unk> and <unk> that speak no more ; <unk> brought home from the fairy ground Only <unk> by youthful feet , <unk> of a future never found , <unk> of a past still sweet ; <unk> <unk> , stories wild , April letters , warm and cold , <unk> of a wilful child , <unk> of a woman early old ; A woman in a lonely home , <unk> , like a sad refrain , -- &apos; Be worthy love , and love will come , &apos; In the falling summer rain .
&quot; My Beth !
the dust is always swept From the lid that bears your name , As if by loving eyes that wept , By careful hands that often came .
<unk> <unk> for us one saint , Ever less human than divine , And still we lay , with tender <unk> , <unk> in this household <unk> The silver bell , so seldom rung , The little cap which last she wore , The fair , dead <unk> that hung By angels borne above her door ; The songs she sang , without lament , In her <unk> of pain , <unk> are they sweetly <unk> With the falling summer rain .
&quot; Upon the last lid &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> now both fair and <unk> A gallant knight bears on his shield , &apos; Amy , &apos; in letters gold and blue .
<unk> lie <unk> that bound her hair , <unk> that have danced their last , <unk> flowers laid by with care , <unk> whose airy <unk> are past ; <unk> <unk> , all ardent <unk> , <unk> that have borne their part In girlish hopes and fears and <unk> , -- The record of a maiden heart Now learning fairer , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , like a blithe refrain , The silver sound of bridal bells In the falling summer rain .
&quot; Four little chests all in a row , <unk> with dust , and worn by time , Four women , taught by <unk> and woe To love and labor in their prime .
Four sisters , parted for an hour , None lost , one only gone before , <unk> by love &apos;s immortal power , <unk> and dearest <unk> .
Oh , when these hidden stores of ours <unk> open to the Father &apos;s sight , May they be rich in golden hours , <unk> that show fairer for the light , <unk> whose brave music long shall ring , Like a <unk> strain , <unk> that shall gladly <unk> and sing In the long sunshine after rain .
&quot; <unk> M. &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very bad poetry , but I felt it when I wrote it , one day when I was very lonely , and had a good cry on a rag-bag .
I never thought it would go where it could tell tales , &quot; said Jo , tearing up the verses the Professor had <unk> so long .
&quot; Let it go , it has done its duty , and I will haf a fresh one when I read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets , &quot; said Mr. Bhaer , with a smile , as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind .
&quot; Yes , &quot; he added earnestly , &quot; I read that , and I think to myself , &apos; She has a sorrow , she is lonely , she would find comfort in true love .
I haf a heart full , full for her ; shall I not go and say , &apos; If this is not too poor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive , take it in Gott &apos;s name ? &apos; &quot;
&quot; And so you came to find that it was not too poor , but the one precious thing I needed , &quot; whispered Jo .
&quot; I had no courage to think that at first , heavenly kind as was your welcome to me .
But soon I began to hope , and then I said , &apos; I will haf her if I die for it , &apos; and so I will ! &quot;
cried Mr. Bhaer , with a <unk> nod , as if the walls of <unk> <unk> round them were <unk> which he was to <unk> or <unk> knock down .
Jo thought that was splendid , and resolved to be worthy of her knight , though he did not come prancing on a <unk> in gorgeous array .
&quot; What made you stay away so long ? &quot;
she asked presently , finding it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that she could not keep silent .
&quot; It was not easy , but I could not find the heart to take you from that so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to give you , after much time , perhaps , and hard work .
How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow , who has no fortune but a little learning ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad you _ are _ poor ; I couldn &apos;t bear a rich husband , &quot; said Jo decidedly , adding , in a <unk> tone , &quot; Don &apos;t fear poverty ; I &apos;ve known it long enough to lose my dread , and be happy working for those I love ; and don &apos;t call yourself old , <unk> is the prime of life .
I couldn &apos;t help loving you if you were seventy ! &quot;
The Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief , if he could have got at it ; as he couldn &apos;t , Jo wiped his eyes for him , and said , laughing , as she took away a bundle or two , -- &quot; I may be strong-minded , but no one can say I &apos;m out of my <unk> now , for woman &apos;s special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing burdens .
I &apos;m to carry my share , Friedrich , and help to earn the home .
Make up your mind to that , or I &apos;ll never go , &quot; she added <unk> , as he tried to <unk> his load .
&quot; We shall see .
<unk> you patience to wait a long time , Jo ?
I must go away and do my work alone .
I must help my boys first , because , even for you , I may not break my word to Minna .
Can you <unk> that , and be happy while we hope and wait ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I know I can ; for we love one another , and that makes all the rest easy to bear .
I have my duty , also , and my work .
I couldn &apos;t enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you , so there &apos;s no need of hurry or impatience .
You can do your part out <unk> , I can do mine here , and both be happy hoping for the best , and leaving the future to be as God wills . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
thou <unk> me such hope and courage , and I haf nothing to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands , &quot; cried the Professor , quite overcome .
&#91; Illustration : Under the umbrella &#93; Jo never , never would learn to be proper ; for when he said that as they stood upon the steps , she just put both hands into his , whispering tenderly , &quot; Not empty now ; &quot; and , stooping down , kissed her Friedrich under the umbrella .
It was dreadful , but she would have done it if the flock of <unk> <unk> on the hedge had been human beings , for she was very far gone indeed , and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness .
Though it came in such a very simple <unk> , that was the crowning moment of both their lives , when , turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them , with a glad &quot; Welcome home ! &quot;
Jo led her lover in , and shut the door .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : <unk> time &#93; <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited , hoped and loved , met occasionally , and wrote such <unk> letters that the rise in the price of paper was <unk> for , Laurie said .
The second year began rather soberly , for their <unk> did not brighten , and Aunt March died suddenly .
But when their first sorrow was over , --for they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue , <unk> found they had cause for rejoicing , for she had left Plumfield to Jo , which made all sorts of joyful things possible .
&quot; It &apos;s a fine old place , and will bring a handsome sum ; for of course you intend to sell it , &quot; said Laurie , as they were all talking the matter over , some weeks later .
&quot; No , I don &apos;t , &quot; was Jo &apos;s decided answer , as she petted the fat poodle , whom she had <unk> , out of respect to his former mistress .
&quot; You don &apos;t mean to live there ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I do . &quot;
&quot; But , my dear girl , it &apos;s an immense house , and will take a power of money to keep it in order .
The garden and orchard alone need two or three men , and <unk> isn &apos;t in Bhaer &apos;s line , I take it . &quot;
&quot; He &apos;ll try his hand at it there , if I propose it . &quot;
&quot; And you expect to live on the produce of the place ?
Well , that sounds <unk> , but you &apos;ll find it desperate hard work . &quot;
&quot; The crop we are going to <unk> is a profitable one ; &quot; and Jo laughed .
&quot; Of what is this fine crop to <unk> , ma &apos;am ? &quot;
&quot; Boys .
I want to open a school for little lads , --a good , happy , homelike school , with me to take care of them , and Fritz to teach them . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s a truly <unk> plan for you !
Isn &apos;t that just like her ? &quot;
cried Laurie , appealing to the family , who looked as much surprised as he .
&quot; I like it , &quot; said Mrs. March decidedly .
&quot; So do I , &quot; added her husband , who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the <unk> method of education on <unk> youth .
&quot; It will be an immense care for Jo , &quot; said Meg , stroking the head of her one all-absorbing son .
&quot; Jo can do it , and be happy in it .
It &apos;s a splendid idea .
Tell us all about it , &quot; cried Mr. Laurence , who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand , but knew that they would refuse his help .
&quot; I knew you &apos;d stand by me , sir .
Amy does <unk> see it in her eyes , though she prudently <unk> to turn it over in her mind before she speaks .
Now , my dear people , &quot; continued Jo earnestly , &quot; just understand that this isn &apos;t a new idea of mine , but a <unk> plan .
Before my Fritz came , I used to think how , when I &apos;d made my fortune , and no one needed me at home , I &apos;d hire a big house , and pick up some poor , forlorn little lads , who hadn &apos;t any mothers , and take care of them , and make life jolly for them before it was too late .
I see so many going to ruin , for want of help at the right minute ; I love so to do anything for them ; I seem to feel their wants , and sympathize with their troubles , and , oh , I should _ so _ like to be a mother to them ! &quot;
Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo , who took it , smiling , with tears in her eyes , and went on in the old enthusiastic way , which they had not seen for a long while .
&quot; I told my plan to Fritz once , and he said it was just what he would like , and agreed to try it when we got rich .
Bless his dear heart , he &apos;s been doing it all his life , <unk> poor boys , I mean , not getting rich ; that he &apos;ll never be ; money doesn &apos;t stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any .
But now , thanks to my good old aunt , who loved me better than I ever deserved , _ I &apos;m _ rich , at least I feel so , and we can live at Plumfield perfectly well , if we have a <unk> school .
It &apos;s just the place for boys , the house is big , and the furniture strong and plain .
There &apos;s plenty of room for <unk> inside , and splendid grounds outside .
They could help in the garden and orchard : such work is healthy , isn &apos;t it , sir ?
Then Fritz can train and teach in his own way , and father will help him .
I can feed and nurse and pet and scold them ; and mother will be my <unk> .
I &apos;ve always longed for lots of boys , and never had enough ; now I can fill the house full , and revel in the little dears to my heart &apos;s content .
<unk> what luxury , <unk> my own , and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me ! &quot;
As Jo waved her hands , and gave a sigh of rapture , the family went off into a <unk> of merriment , and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought he &apos;d have an <unk> fit .
&quot; I don &apos;t see anything funny , &quot; she said gravely , when she could be heard .
&quot; Nothing could be more natural or proper than for my Professor to open a school , and for me to prefer to <unk> on my own <unk> . &quot;
&quot; She is putting on airs already , &quot; said Laurie , who regarded the idea in the light of a capital joke .
&quot; But may I inquire how you intend to support the establishment ?
If all the pupils are little <unk> , I &apos;m afraid your crop won &apos;t be profitable in a worldly sense , Mrs.
Bhaer . &quot;
&quot; Now don &apos;t be a <unk> , Teddy .
Of course I shall have rich pupils , also , <unk> begin with such altogether ; then , when I &apos;ve got a start , I can take a <unk> or two , just for a relish .
Rich people &apos;s children often need care and comfort , as well as poor .
I &apos;ve seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants , or <unk> ones pushed forward , when it &apos;s real <unk> .
Some are naughty through <unk> or neglect , and some lose their mothers .
Besides , the best have to get through the <unk> age , and that &apos;s the very time they need most patience and kindness .
People laugh at them , and <unk> them about , try to keep them out of sight , and expect them to turn , all at once , from pretty children into fine young men .
They don &apos;t complain much , <unk> little souls , --but they feel it .
I &apos;ve been through something of it , and I know all about it .
I &apos;ve a special interest in such young bears , and like to show them that I see the warm , honest , <unk> boys &apos; hearts , in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsy-turvy heads .
I &apos;ve had experience , too , for haven &apos;t I brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll <unk> that you tried to do it , &quot; said Laurie , with a grateful look .
&quot; And I &apos;ve succeeded beyond my hopes ; for here you are , a steady , sensible business man , doing heaps of good with your money , and laying up the blessings of the poor , instead of dollars .
But you are not merely a business man : you love good and beautiful things , enjoy them yourself , and let others go halves , as you always did in the old times .
I _ am _ proud of you , Teddy , for you get better every year , and every one feels it , though you won &apos;t let them say so .
Yes , and when I have my flock , I &apos;ll just point to you , and say , &apos; There &apos;s your model , my lads . &apos; &quot;
Poor Laurie didn &apos;t know where to look ; for , man though he was , something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him .
&quot; I say , Jo , that &apos;s rather too much , &quot; he began , just in his old boyish way .
&quot; You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for , except by doing my best not to disappoint you .
You have rather cast me off lately , Jo , but I &apos;ve had the best of help , nevertheless ; so , if I &apos;ve got on at all , you may thank these two for it ; &quot; and he laid one hand gently on his grandfather &apos;s white head , the other on Amy &apos;s golden one , for the three were never far apart .
&quot; I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world ! &quot;
burst out Jo , who was in an unusually uplifted frame of mind just then .
&quot; When I have one of my own , I hope it will be as happy as the three I know and love the best .
If John and my Fritz were only here , it would be quite a little heaven on earth , &quot; she added more quietly .
And that night , when she went to her room , after a blissful evening of family <unk> , hopes , and plans , her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own , and thinking tender thoughts of Beth .
It was a very astonishing year altogether , for things seemed to happen in an unusually <unk> and delightful manner .
<unk> before she knew where she was , Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield .
Then a family of six or seven boys <unk> up like <unk> , and flourished <unk> , poor boys as well as rich ; for Mr. Laurence was continually finding some touching case of <unk> , and begging the <unk> to take pity on the child , and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support .
In this way the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo , and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted .
Of course it was <unk> work at first , and Jo made queer mistakes ; but the wise Professor <unk> her safely into <unk> <unk> , and the most <unk> <unk> was conquered in the end .
How Jo did enjoy her &quot; wilderness of boys , &quot; and how poor , dear Aunt March would have <unk> had she been there to see the sacred <unk> of prim , <unk> Plumfield <unk> with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> !
There was a sort of <unk> justice about it , after all , for the old lady had been the <unk> of the boys for miles round ; and now the <unk> <unk> freely on forbidden <unk> , <unk> up the <unk> with <unk> boots <unk> , and played cricket in the big field where the <unk> &quot; <unk> with a crumpled <unk> &quot; used to invite rash <unk> to come and be tossed .
It became a sort of boys &apos; paradise , and Laurie suggested that it should be called the &quot; <unk> , &quot; as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its <unk> .
It never was a fashionable school , and the Professor did not lay up a fortune ; but it _ was _ just what Jo intended it to be , -- &quot; a happy , homelike place for boys , who needed teaching , care , and kindness . &quot;
Every room in the big house was soon full ; every little plot in the garden soon had its owner ; a regular <unk> appeared in <unk> and shed , for pet <unk> were allowed ; and , three times a day , Jo smiled at her Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with <unk> of happy young faces , which all turned to her with affectionate eyes , confiding words , and grateful hearts , full of love for &quot; Mother Bhaer . &quot;
She had boys enough now , and did not tire of them , though they were not angels , by any means , and some of them caused both Professor and <unk> much trouble and anxiety .
But her faith in the good spot which <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , <unk> , most <unk> little <unk> gave her patience , skill , and , in time , success ; for no mortal boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as <unk> as the sun , and Mother Bhaer <unk> him seventy times seven .
Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads ; their penitent <unk> and whispers after <unk> ; their droll or touching little confidences ; their pleasant <unk> , hopes , and plans ; even their <unk> , for they only <unk> them to her all the more .
There were slow boys and bashful boys ; feeble boys and riotous boys ; boys that <unk> and boys that <unk> ; one or two lame ones ; and a merry little <unk> , who could not be taken in elsewhere , but who was welcome to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; though some people <unk> that his admission would ruin the school .
Yes ; Jo was a very happy woman there , in spite of hard work , much anxiety , and a perpetual racket .
She enjoyed it heartily , and found the applause of her boys more <unk> than any praise of the world ; for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic <unk> and <unk> .
As the years went on , two little lads of her own came to increase her happiness , <unk> , named for grandpa , and Teddy , a <unk> baby , who seemed to have <unk> his papa &apos;s sunshiny temper as well as his mother &apos;s lively spirit .
How they ever grew up alive in that <unk> of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts ; but they flourished like <unk> in spring , and their rough <unk> loved and served them well .
There were a great many <unk> at Plumfield , and one of the most delightful was the <unk> <unk> ; for then the Marches , Laurences , <unk> , and <unk> turned out in full force , and made a day of it .
<unk> years after Jo &apos;s wedding , one of these <unk> <unk> occurred , --a mellow October day , when the air was full of an <unk> <unk> which made the spirits rise , and the blood dance <unk> in the <unk> .
The old orchard wore its holiday <unk> ; <unk> and <unk> <unk> the mossy walls ; <unk> skipped briskly in the <unk> grass , and <unk> chirped like fairy <unk> at a feast ; <unk> were busy with their small <unk> ; birds <unk> their <unk> from the <unk> in the <unk> ; and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake .
Everybody was there ; everybody laughed and sang , climbed up and tumbled down ; everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it ; and every one gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world .
Mr. March strolled <unk> about , quoting <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> to Mr. Laurence , while <unk> &quot; The gentle <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The Professor <unk> up and down the green <unk> like a stout <unk> knight , with a <unk> for a <unk> , leading on the boys , who made a <unk> and ladder company of themselves , and performed <unk> in the way of ground and <unk> tumbling .
Laurie devoted himself to the little ones , rode his small daughter in a <unk> , took Daisy up among the birds &apos; <unk> , and kept <unk> <unk> from breaking his neck .
Mrs. March and Meg sat among the <unk> piles like a pair of <unk> , sorting the contributions that kept <unk> in ; while Amy , with a beautiful motherly expression in her face , sketched the various <unk> , and watched over one pale lad , who sat <unk> her with his little crutch beside him .
Jo was in her element that day , and rushed about , with her gown <unk> up , her hat anywhere but on her head , and her baby tucked under her arm , ready for any lively <unk> which might turn up .
Little Teddy bore a charmed life , for nothing ever happened to him , and Jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad , <unk> off on the back of another , or supplied with sour <unk> by his <unk> papa , who labored under the <unk> delusion that babies could <unk> anything , from pickled <unk> to buttons , <unk> , and their own small shoes .
She knew that little <unk> would turn up again in time , safe and rosy , dirty and serene , and she always received him back with a hearty welcome , for Jo loved her babies tenderly .
&#91; Illustration : Teddy bore a charmed life &#93; At four o &apos;clock a lull took place , and baskets remained empty , while the <unk> rested , and compared <unk> and <unk> .
Then Jo and Meg , with a <unk> of the bigger boys , set forth the supper on the grass , for an <unk> tea was always the crowning joy of the day .
The land <unk> <unk> with milk and honey on such occasions , for the lads were not <unk> to sit at table , but allowed to partake of refreshment as they liked , <unk> being the <unk> best beloved by the boyish soul .
They <unk> themselves of the <unk> <unk> to the fullest extent , for some tried the pleasing experiment of <unk> milk while standing on their heads , others lent a charm to <unk> by eating <unk> in the <unk> of the game , <unk> were <unk> <unk> over the field , and <unk> <unk> in the trees like a new style of bird .
The little girls had a private <unk> , and <unk> <unk> among the <unk> at his own sweet will .
When no one could eat any more , the Professor proposed the first regular toast , which was always drunk at such times , -- &quot; Aunt March , God bless her ! &quot;
A toast heartily given by the good man , who never forgot how much he <unk> her , and quietly drunk by the boys , who had been taught to keep her memory green .
&quot; Now , grandma &apos;s <unk> birthday !
Long life to her , with three times three ! &quot;
That was given with a will , as you may well believe ; and the cheering once begun , it was hard to stop it .
Everybody &apos;s health was proposed , from Mr. Laurence , who was considered their special <unk> , to the astonished <unk> , who had strayed from its proper <unk> in search of its young master .
Demi , as the oldest <unk> , then presented the queen of the day with various gifts , so <unk> that they were <unk> to the festive scene in a <unk> .
<unk> presents , some of them , but what would have been <unk> to other eyes were ornaments to grandma &apos;s , --for the children &apos;s gifts were all their own .
Every <unk> Daisy &apos;s patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than <unk> to Mrs. March ; Demi &apos;s <unk> was a miracle of <unk> skill , though the cover wouldn &apos;t shut ; <unk> &apos;s <unk> had a <unk> in its uneven legs , that she declared was very soothing ; and no page of the <unk> book Amy &apos;s child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared , in <unk> <unk> , the words , -- &quot; To dear <unk> , from her little Beth . &quot;
During this ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared ; and , when Mrs. March had tried to thank her children , and broken down , while Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore , the Professor suddenly began to sing .
Then , from above him , voice after voice took up the words , and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen <unk> , as the boys sung , with all their hearts , the little song Jo had written , Laurie set to music , and the Professor <unk> his lads to give with the best effect .
This was something altogether new , and it proved a grand success ; for Mrs. March couldn &apos;t get over her surprise , and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the <unk> birds , from tall Franz and Emil to the little <unk> , who had the sweetest voice of all .
After this , the boys <unk> for a final lark , leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival tree .
&#91; Illustration : &quot; Leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival tree . &quot;
--Page <unk> &#93; &quot; I don &apos;t think I ever ought to call myself &apos; <unk> Jo &apos; again , when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified , &quot; said Mrs. Bhaer , taking Teddy &apos;s little fist out of the <unk> , in which he was <unk> <unk> .
&quot; And yet your life is very different from the one you <unk> so long ago .
Do you remember our <unk> in the air ? &quot;
asked Amy , smiling as she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys .
&quot; Dear fellows !
It does my heart good to see them forget business , and frolic for a day , &quot; answered Jo , who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind .
&quot; Yes , I remember ; but the life I wanted then seems selfish , lonely , and cold to me now .
I haven &apos;t given up the hope that I may write a good book yet , but I can wait , and I &apos;m sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as these ; &quot; and Jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father , leaning on the Professor &apos;s arm , as they walked to and fro in the sunshine , deep in one of the <unk> which both enjoyed so much , and then to her mother , sitting <unk> among her daughters , with their children in her lap and at her feet , as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them .
&quot; My castle was the most nearly realized of all .
I asked for splendid things , to be sure , but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied , if I had a little home , and John , and some dear children like these .
I &apos;ve got them all , thank God , and am the happiest woman in the world ; &quot; and Meg laid her hand on her tall boy &apos;s head , with a face full of tender and <unk> content .
&quot; My castle is very different from what I planned , but I would not <unk> it , though , like Jo , I don &apos;t <unk> all my artistic hopes , or <unk> myself to helping others <unk> their dreams of beauty .
I &apos;ve begun to model a figure of baby , and Laurie says it is the best thing I &apos;ve ever done .
I think so myself , and mean to do it in marble , so that , whatever happens , I may at least keep the <unk> of my little angel . &quot;
As Amy spoke , a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the <unk> child in her arms ; for her one <unk> daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy &apos;s sunshine .
This cross was doing much for both father and mother , for one love and sorrow bound them closely together .
Amy &apos;s nature was growing sweeter , <unk> , and more tender ; Laurie was growing more serious , strong , and firm ; and both were learning that beauty , youth , good fortune , even love itself , cannot keep care and pain , loss and sorrow , from the most blest ; <unk> &quot; <unk> each life some rain must fall , Some days must be dark and sad and dreary . &quot;
&quot; She is growing better , I am sure of it , my dear .
Don &apos;t <unk> , but hope and keep happy , &quot; said Mrs. March , as tender-hearted Daisy stooped from her knee , to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin &apos;s pale one .
&quot; I never ought to , while I have you to cheer me up , Marmee , and Laurie to take more than half of every burden , &quot; replied Amy warmly .
&quot; He never lets me see his anxiety , but is so sweet and patient with me , so devoted to Beth , and such a stay and comfort to me always , that I can &apos;t love him enough .
So , in spite of my one cross , I can say with Meg , &apos; Thank God , I &apos;m a happy woman . &apos; &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s no need for me to say it , for every one can see that I &apos;m far happier than I deserve , &quot; added Jo , glancing from her good husband to her <unk> children , tumbling on the grass beside her .
&quot; Fritz is getting gray and stout ; I &apos;m growing as thin as a shadow , and am thirty ; we never shall be rich , and Plumfield may burn up any night , for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs _ will _ smoke <unk> <unk> under the <unk> , though he &apos;s set himself <unk> three times already .
But in spite of these unromantic facts , I have nothing to complain of , and never was so jolly in my life .
<unk> the remark , but living among boys , I can &apos;t help using their <unk> now and then . &quot;
&quot; Yes , Jo , I think your <unk> will be a good one , &quot; began Mrs. March , <unk> away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of countenance .
&quot; Not half so good as yours , mother .
Here it is , and we never can thank you enough for the patient <unk> and <unk> you have done , &quot; cried Jo , with the loving <unk> which she never could <unk> .
&quot; I hope there will be more <unk> and <unk> <unk> every year , &quot; said Amy softly .
&quot; A large <unk> , but I know there &apos;s room in your heart for it , Marmee dear , &quot; added Meg &apos;s tender voice .
<unk> to the heart , Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms , as if to gather children and <unk> to herself , and say , with face and voice full of motherly love , gratitude , and humility , -- &quot; O , my girls , however long you may live , I never can wish you a greater happiness than this ! &quot;
