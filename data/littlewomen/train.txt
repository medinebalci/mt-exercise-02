<unk> <unk> .
&quot; Christmas won &apos;t be Christmas without any presents , &quot; <unk> Jo , lying on the rug .
&quot; It &apos;s so dreadful to be poor ! &quot;
sighed Meg , looking down at her old dress .
&quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things , and other girls nothing at all , &quot; added little Amy , with an injured sniff .
&quot; We &apos;ve got father and mother and each other , &quot; said Beth <unk> , from her corner .
The four young faces on which the <unk> shone brightened at the cheerful words , but darkened again as Jo said sadly , -- &quot; We haven &apos;t got father , and shall not have him for a long time . &quot;
She didn &apos;t say &quot; perhaps never , &quot; but each silently added it , thinking of father far away , where the fighting was .
Nobody spoke for a minute ; then Meg said in an altered tone , -- &quot; You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one ; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure , when our men are suffering so in the army .
We can &apos;t do much , but we can make our little sacrifices , and ought to do it gladly .
But I am afraid I don &apos;t ; &quot; and Meg shook her head , as she thought <unk> of all the pretty things she wanted .
&quot; But I don &apos;t think the little we should spend would do any good .
We &apos;ve each got a dollar , and the army wouldn &apos;t be much helped by our giving that .
I agree not to expect anything from mother or you , but I do want to buy <unk> and <unk> for myself ; I &apos;ve wanted it _ so _ long , &quot; said Jo , who was a <unk> .
&quot; I planned to spend mine in new music , &quot; said Beth , with a little sigh , which no one heard but the <unk> and <unk> .
&quot; I shall get a nice box of <unk> &apos;s <unk> ; I really need them , &quot; said Amy decidedly .
&quot; Mother didn &apos;t say anything about our money , and she won &apos;t wish us to give up everything .
Let &apos;s each buy what we want , and have a little fun ; I &apos;m sure we work hard enough to earn it , &quot; cried Jo , examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner .
&quot; I know _ I _ do , <unk> those <unk> children nearly all day , when I &apos;m longing to enjoy myself at home , &quot; began Meg , in the complaining tone again .
&quot; You don &apos;t have half such a hard time as I do , &quot; said Jo .
&quot; How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous , fussy old lady , who keeps you trotting , is never satisfied , and worries you till you &apos;re ready to fly out of the window or cry ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s naughty to fret ; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world .
It makes me cross ; and my hands get so stiff , I can &apos;t practise well at all ; &quot; and Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time .
&quot; I don &apos;t believe any of you suffer as I do , &quot; cried Amy ; &quot; for you don &apos;t have to go to school with impertinent girls , who plague you if you don &apos;t know your lessons , and laugh at your dresses , and <unk> your father if he isn &apos;t rich , and insult you when your nose isn &apos;t nice . &quot;
&quot; If you mean _ <unk> _ , I &apos;d say so , and not talk about _ <unk> _ , as if papa was a <unk> , &quot; advised Jo , laughing .
&quot; I know what I mean , and you needn &apos;t be _ <unk> _ about it .
It &apos;s proper to use good words , and improve your _ <unk> _ , &quot; returned Amy , with dignity .
&quot; Don &apos;t peck at one another , children .
Don &apos;t you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little , Jo ?
Dear me !
how happy and good we &apos;d be , if we had no worries ! &quot;
said Meg , who could remember better times .
&quot; You said the other day , you thought we were a deal happier than the King children , for they were fighting and fretting all the time , in spite of their money . &quot;
&quot; So I did , Beth .
Well , I think we are ; for , though we do have to work , we make fun for ourselves , and are a pretty jolly set , as Jo would say . &quot;
&quot; Jo does use such slang words ! &quot;
observed Amy , with a <unk> look at the long figure stretched on the rug .
Jo immediately sat up , put her hands in her pockets , and began to whistle .
&quot; Don &apos;t , Jo ; it &apos;s so boyish ! &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s why I do it . &quot;
&quot; I <unk> rude , <unk> girls ! &quot;
&quot; I hate affected , <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
&quot; &apos; <unk> in their little <unk> agree , &apos; &quot; sang Beth , the <unk> , with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh , and the &quot; pecking &quot; ended for that time .
&quot; Really , girls , you are both to be <unk> , &quot; said Meg , beginning to lecture in her <unk> fashion .
&quot; You are old enough to leave off boyish <unk> , and to behave better , Josephine .
It didn &apos;t matter so much when you were a little girl ; but now you are so tall , and turn up your hair , you should remember that you are a young lady . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not !
and if turning up my hair makes me one , I &apos;ll wear it in two <unk> till I &apos;m twenty , &quot; cried Jo , pulling off her <unk> , and shaking down a chestnut mane .
&quot; I hate to think I &apos;ve got to grow up , and be Miss March , and wear long gowns , and look as prim as a <unk> !
It &apos;s bad enough to be a girl , <unk> , when I like boys &apos; games and work and manners !
I can &apos;t get over my disappointment in not being a boy ; and it &apos;s worse than ever now , for I &apos;m dying to go and fight with papa , and I can only stay at home and knit , like a <unk> old woman ! &quot;
And Jo shook the blue <unk> till the needles <unk> like <unk> , and her ball <unk> across the room .
&quot; Poor Jo !
It &apos;s too bad , but it can &apos;t be helped ; so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish , and playing brother to us girls , &quot; said Beth , stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that all the <unk> and <unk> in the world could not make <unk> in its touch .
&quot; As for you , Amy , &quot; continued Meg , &quot; you are altogether too particular and prim .
Your airs are funny now ; but you &apos;ll grow up an affected little goose , if you don &apos;t take care .
I like your nice manners and <unk> ways of speaking , when you don &apos;t try to be elegant ; but your absurd words are as bad as Jo &apos;s slang . &quot;
&quot; If Jo is a <unk> and Amy a goose , what am I , please ? &quot;
asked Beth , ready to share the lecture .
&quot; You &apos;re a dear , and nothing else , &quot; answered Meg warmly ; and no one <unk> her , for the &quot; <unk> &quot; was the pet of the family .
As young readers like to know &quot; how people look , &quot; we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters , who sat knitting away in the twilight , while the <unk> snow fell quietly without , and the fire <unk> cheerfully within .
It was a comfortable old room , though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain ; for a good picture or two hung on the walls , books filled the <unk> , <unk> and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows , and a pleasant atmosphere of <unk> pervaded it .
Margaret , the eldest of the four , was sixteen , and very pretty , being plump and fair , with large eyes , plenty of soft , brown hair , a sweet mouth , and white hands , of which she was rather vain .
<unk> Jo was very tall , thin , and brown , and reminded one of a colt ; for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs , which were very much in her way .
She had a decided mouth , a comical nose , and sharp , gray eyes , which appeared to see everything , and were by turns fierce , funny , or thoughtful .
Her long , thick hair was her one beauty ; but it was usually bundled into a <unk> , to be out of her way .
<unk> shoulders had Jo , big hands and feet , a fly-away look to her clothes , and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly <unk> up into a woman , and didn &apos;t like it .
<unk> Beth , as every one called <unk> a rosy , <unk> , bright-eyed girl of <unk> , with a shy manner , a timid voice , and a peaceful expression , which was seldom disturbed .
Her father called her &quot; Little <unk> , &quot; and the name suited her excellently ; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own , only <unk> out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved .
Amy , though the <unk> , was a most important person , <unk> her own opinion at least .
A regular <unk> , with blue eyes , and yellow hair , <unk> on her shoulders , pale and slender , and always carrying herself like a young lady <unk> of her manners .
What the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out .
The clock struck six ; and , having swept up the hearth , Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm .
Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls ; for mother was coming , and every one brightened to welcome her .
Meg stopped <unk> , and lighted the lamp , Amy got out of the easy-chair without being asked , and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze .
&#91; Illustration : Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm &#93; &quot; They are quite worn out ; Marmee must have a new pair . &quot;
&quot; I thought I &apos;d get her some with my dollar , &quot; said Beth .
&quot; No , I shall ! &quot;
cried Amy .
&quot; I &apos;m the oldest , &quot; began Meg , but Jo cut in with a <unk> &quot; I &apos;m the man of the family now papa is away , and _ I _ shall provide the slippers , for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you what we &apos;ll do , &quot; said Beth ; &quot; let &apos;s each get her something for Christmas , and not get anything for ourselves . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s like you , dear !
What will we get ? &quot;
exclaimed Jo .
Every one thought soberly for a minute ; then Meg announced , as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands , &quot; I shall give her a nice pair of gloves . &quot;
&quot; <unk> shoes , best to be had , &quot; cried Jo .
&quot; Some handkerchiefs , all hemmed , &quot; said Beth .
&quot; I &apos;ll get a little bottle of cologne ; she likes it , and it won &apos;t cost much , so I &apos;ll have some left to buy my pencils , &quot; added Amy .
&quot; How will we give the things ? &quot;
asked Meg .
&quot; Put them on the table , and bring her in and see her open the bundles .
Don &apos;t you remember how we used to do on our <unk> ? &quot;
answered Jo .
&#91; Illustration : I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big chair &#93; &quot; I used to be _ so _ frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big chair with the <unk> on , and see you all come marching round to give the presents , with a kiss .
I liked the things and the kisses , but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles , &quot; said Beth , who was <unk> her face and the bread for tea , at the same time .
&quot; Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves , and then surprise her .
We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon , Meg ; there is so much to do about the play for Christmas night , &quot; said Jo , marching up and down , with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air .
&quot; I don &apos;t mean to act any more after this time ; I &apos;m getting too old for such things , &quot; observed Meg , who was as much a child as ever about &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
&quot; You won &apos;t stop , I know , as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down , and wear <unk> <unk> .
You are the best <unk> we &apos;ve got , and there &apos;ll be an end of everything if you <unk> the <unk> , &quot; said Jo .
&quot; We ought to <unk> to-night .
Come here , Amy , and do the fainting scene , for you are as stiff as a <unk> in that . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t help it ; I never saw any one faint , and I don &apos;t choose to make myself all black and blue , tumbling flat as you do .
If I can go down easily , I &apos;ll drop ; if I can &apos;t , I shall fall into a chair and be graceful ; I don &apos;t care if Hugo does come at me with a <unk> , &quot; returned Amy , who was not gifted with dramatic power , but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out <unk> by the villain of the piece .
&#91; Illustration : Do it this way , clasp your hands so &#93; &quot; Do it this way ; clasp your hands so , and <unk> across the room , crying <unk> , &apos; Roderigo !
save me !
save me ! &apos; &quot;
and away went Jo , with a melodramatic <unk> which was truly thrilling .
Amy followed , but she poked her hands out <unk> before her , and <unk> herself along as if she went by machinery ; and her &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish .
Jo gave a despairing groan , and Meg laughed outright , while Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun , with interest .
&quot; It &apos;s no use !
Do the best you can when the time comes , and if the audience laugh , don &apos;t blame me .
Come on , Meg . &quot;
Then things went smoothly , for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break ; Hagar , the witch , <unk> an awful <unk> over her <unk> of simmering <unk> , with <unk> effect ; Roderigo <unk> his chains <unk> manfully , and Hugo died in <unk> of remorse and <unk> , with a wild &quot; Ha !
ha ! &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s the best we &apos;ve had yet , &quot; said Meg , as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows .
&quot; I don &apos;t see how you can write and act such splendid things , Jo .
You &apos;re a regular Shakespeare ! &quot;
exclaimed Beth , who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things .
&quot; Not quite , &quot; replied Jo modestly .
&quot; I do think &apos; The <unk> &apos;s <unk> , an <unk> <unk> , &apos; is rather a nice thing ; but I &apos;d like to try <unk> , if we only had a <unk> for <unk> .
I always wanted to do the <unk> part .
<unk> that a <unk> that I see before me ? &apos; &quot;
muttered Jo , rolling her eyes and <unk> at the air , as she had seen a famous <unk> do .
&quot; No , it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , with mother &apos;s shoe on it instead of the bread .
Beth &apos;s <unk> ! &quot;
cried Meg , and the <unk> ended in a general burst of laughter .
&quot; Glad to find you so merry , my girls , &quot; said a cheery voice at the door , and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall , motherly lady , with a &quot; <unk> &quot; look about her which was truly delightful .
She was not <unk> dressed , but a <unk> woman , and the girls thought the gray cloak and <unk> bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world .
&quot; Well , <unk> , how have you got on to-day ?
There was so much to do , getting the boxes ready to go to-morrow , that I didn &apos;t come home to dinner .
Has any one called , Beth ?
How is your cold , Meg ?
Jo , you look tired to death .
Come and kiss me , baby . &quot;
While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off , her warm slippers on , and sitting down in the easy-chair , drew Amy to her lap , preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day .
The girls flew about , trying to make things comfortable , each in her own way .
Meg arranged the <unk> ; Jo brought wood and set chairs , dropping , <unk> , and <unk> everything she touched ; Beth <unk> to and fro between parlor and kitchen , quiet and busy ; while Amy gave directions to every one , as she sat with her hands folded .
As they gathered about the table , Mrs. March said , with a particularly happy face , &quot; I &apos;ve got a treat for you after supper . &quot;
A quick , bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine .
Beth clapped her hands , regardless of the <unk> she held , and Jo tossed up her napkin , crying , &quot; A letter !
a letter !
Three cheers for father ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , a nice long letter .
He is well , and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared .
He sends all sorts of loving wishes for Christmas , and an especial message to you girls , &quot; said Mrs. March , patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there .
&quot; <unk> and get done !
Don &apos;t stop to <unk> your little finger , and <unk> over your plate , Amy , &quot; cried Jo , <unk> in her tea , and dropping her bread , butter side down , on the carpet , in her haste to get at the treat .
Beth ate no more , but crept away , to sit in her <unk> corner and brood over the delight to come , till the others were ready .
&quot; I think it was so splendid in father to go as a <unk> when he was too old to be <unk> , and not strong enough for a <unk> , &quot; said Meg warmly .
&quot; Don &apos;t I wish I could go as a <unk> , a _ <unk> _ <unk> &apos;s its name ?
or a nurse , so I could be near him and help him , &quot; exclaimed Jo , with a groan .
&quot; It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent , and eat all sorts of <unk> things , and drink out of a tin <unk> , &quot; sighed Amy .
&quot; When will he come home , Marmee ? &quot;
asked Beth , with a little quiver in her voice .
&quot; Not for many months , dear , unless he is sick .
He will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can , and we won &apos;t ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared .
Now come and hear the letter . &quot;
They all drew to the fire , mother in the big chair with Beth at her feet , Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair , and Jo leaning on the back , where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching .
Very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching , especially those which <unk> sent home .
In this one little was said of the hardships <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> conquered ; it was a cheerful , hopeful letter , full of lively <unk> of camp life , <unk> , and <unk> news ; and only at the end did the writer &apos;s heart <unk> with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home .
&#91; Illustration : It was a cheerful , hopeful letter &#93; &quot; Give them all my dear love and a kiss .
Tell them I think of them by day , pray for them by night , and find my best comfort in their affection at all times .
A year seems very long to wait before I see them , but remind them that while we wait we may all work , so that these hard days need not be wasted .
I know they will remember all I said to them , that they will be loving children to you , will do their duty faithfully , fight their bosom enemies bravely , and conquer themselves so beautifully , that when I come back to them I may be <unk> and prouder than ever of my little women . &quot;
Everybody sniffed when they came to that part ; Jo wasn &apos;t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose , and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother &apos;s shoulder and sobbed out , &quot; I _ am _ a selfish girl !
but I &apos;ll truly try to be better , so he <unk> &apos;t be disappointed in me by and by . &quot;
&quot; We all will ! &quot;
cried Meg .
&quot; I think too much of my looks , and hate to work , but won &apos;t any more , if I can help it . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll try and be what he loves to call me , &apos; a little woman , &apos; and not be rough and wild ; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else , &quot; said Jo , thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than <unk> a rebel or two down <unk> .
Beth said nothing , but wiped away her tears with the blue <unk> , and began to knit with all her might , losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her , while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home .
&#91; Illustration : How you used to play Pilgrim &apos;s Progress &#93; Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo &apos;s words , by saying in her cheery voice , &quot; Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim &apos;s Progress when you were little things ?
Nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my <unk> on your backs for burdens , give you hats and sticks and <unk> of paper , and let you travel through the house from the cellar , which was the City of <unk> , up , up , to the <unk> , where you had all the lovely things you could <unk> to make a Celestial City . &quot;
&quot; What fun it was , especially going by the lions , fighting <unk> , and passing through the Valley where the <unk> were ! &quot;
said Jo .
&quot; I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled down stairs , &quot; said Meg .
&quot; My favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our flowers and <unk> and pretty things were , and all stood and sung for joy up there in the sunshine , &quot; said Beth , smiling , as if that pleasant moment had come back to her .
&quot; I don &apos;t remember much about it , except that I was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry , and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top .
If I wasn &apos;t too old for such things , I &apos;d rather like to play it over again , &quot; said Amy , who began to talk of <unk> childish things at the <unk> age of twelve .
&quot; We never are too old for this , my dear , because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another .
Our burdens are here , our road is before us , and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that <unk> us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City .
Now , my little pilgrims , suppose you begin again , not in play , but in earnest , and see how far on you can get before father comes home . &quot;
&quot; Really , mother ?
Where are our bundles ? &quot;
asked Amy , who was a very <unk> young lady .
&quot; Each of you told what your burden was just now , except Beth ; I rather think she hasn &apos;t got any , &quot; said her mother .
&quot; Yes , I have ; mine is dishes and <unk> , and <unk> girls with nice <unk> , and being afraid of people . &quot;
Beth &apos;s bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh ; but nobody did , for it would have hurt her feelings very much .
&quot; Let us do it , &quot; said Meg thoughtfully .
&quot; It is only another name for trying to be good , and the story may help us ; for though we do want to be good , it &apos;s hard work , and we forget , and don &apos;t do our best . &quot;
&quot; We were in the <unk> of <unk> to-night , and mother came and pulled us out as <unk> did in the book .
We ought to have our roll of directions , like Christian .
What shall we do about that ? &quot;
asked Jo , delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty .
&quot; Look under your pillows , Christmas morning , and you will find your guide-book , &quot; replied Mrs. March .
They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table ; then out came the four little <unk> , and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for Aunt March .
It was uninteresting sewing , but to-night no one <unk> .
They <unk> Jo &apos;s plan of <unk> the long <unk> into four parts , and calling the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and America , and in that way got on capitally , especially when they talked about the different <unk> as they <unk> their way through them .
&#91; Illustration : No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano &#93; At nine they stopped work , and sung , as usual , before they went to bed .
No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano ; but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys , and making a pleasant <unk> to the simple songs they sung .
Meg had a voice like a <unk> , and she and her mother led the little <unk> .
Amy chirped like a cricket , and Jo <unk> through the airs at her own sweet will , always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a <unk> that spoilt the most pensive tune .
They had always done this from the time they could <unk> &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &apos; <unk> &apos; <unk> , &quot; and it had become a household <unk> , for the mother was a born <unk> .
The first sound in the morning was her voice , as she went about the house singing like a lark ; and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound , for the girls never grew too old for that familiar <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : At nine they stopped work and sung as usual &#93; &#91; Illustration : A Merry Christmas &#93; <unk> .
A <unk> CHRISTMAS .
Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning .
No stockings hung at the <unk> , and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago , when her little sock fell down because it was so <unk> with <unk> .
Then she remembered her mother &apos;s promise , and , <unk> her hand under her pillow , drew out a little <unk> book .
She knew it very well , for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived , and Jo felt that it was a true guide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey .
She woke Meg with a &quot; Merry Christmas , &quot; and bade her see what was under her pillow .
A <unk> book appeared , with the same picture inside , and a few words written by their mother , which made their one present very precious in their eyes .
Presently Beth and Amy woke , to rummage and find their little books also , --one dove-colored , the other blue ; and all sat looking at and talking about them , while the east grew rosy with the coming day .
In spite of her small vanities , Margaret had a sweet and <unk> nature , which unconsciously <unk> her sisters , especially Jo , who loved her very tenderly , and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given .
&quot; Girls , &quot; said Meg seriously , looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little <unk> ones in the room beyond , &quot; mother wants us to read and love and mind these books , and we must begin at once .
We used to be faithful about it ; but since father went away , and all this war trouble unsettled us , we have neglected many things .
You can do as you please ; but _ I _ shall keep my book on the table here , and read a little every morning as soon as I wake , for I know it will do me good , and help me through the day . &quot;
Then she opened her new book and began to read .
Jo put her arm round her , and , leaning cheek to cheek , read also , with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face .
&quot; How good Meg is !
Come , Amy , let &apos;s do as they do .
I &apos;ll help you with the hard words , and they &apos;ll explain things if we don &apos;t understand , &quot; whispered Beth , very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters &apos; example .
&quot; I &apos;m glad mine is blue , &quot; said Amy ; and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned , and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting .
&quot; Where is mother ? &quot;
asked Meg , as she and Jo ran down to thank her for their gifts , half an hour later .
&quot; <unk> only knows .
Some poor <unk> come <unk> &apos; , and your ma went straight off to see what was needed .
There never _ was _ such a woman for <unk> &apos; away <unk> and drink , clothes and <unk> &apos; , &quot; replied Hannah , who had lived with the family since Meg was born , and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant .
&quot; She will be back soon , I think ; so <unk> your <unk> , and have everything ready , &quot; said Meg , looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa , ready to be produced at the proper time .
&quot; Why , where is Amy &apos;s bottle of cologne ? &quot;
she added , as the little <unk> did not appear .
&quot; She took it out a minute ago , and went off with it to put a ribbon on it , or some such notion , &quot; replied Jo , dancing about the room to take the first <unk> off the new <unk> .
&quot; How nice my handkerchiefs look , don &apos;t they ?
Hannah <unk> and <unk> them for me , and I marked them all myself , &quot; said Beth , looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor .
&quot; Bless the child !
she &apos;s gone and put &apos; Mother &apos; on them instead of &apos; M.
March . &apos;
How funny ! &quot;
cried Jo , taking up one .
&quot; Isn &apos;t it right ?
I thought it was better to do it so , because Meg &apos;s <unk> are &apos; M.
M. , &apos; and I don &apos;t want any one to use these but Marmee , &quot; said Beth , looking troubled .
&quot; It &apos;s all right , dear , and a very pretty idea , <unk> sensible , too , for no one can ever mistake now .
It will please her very much , I know , &quot; said Meg , with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth .
&quot; There &apos;s mother .
<unk> the basket , quick ! &quot;
cried Jo , as a door <unk> , and steps sounded in the hall .
Amy came in hastily , and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her .
&quot; Where have you been , and what are you hiding behind you ? &quot;
asked Meg , surprised to see , by her hood and cloak , that lazy Amy had been out so early .
&quot; Don &apos;t laugh at me , Jo !
I didn &apos;t mean any one should know till the time came .
I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one , and I gave _ all _ my money to get it , and I &apos;m truly trying not to be selfish any more . &quot;
As she spoke , Amy showed the handsome <unk> which replaced the cheap one ; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that Meg hugged her on the spot , and Jo pronounced her &quot; a trump , &quot; while Beth ran to the window , and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle .
&quot; You see I felt ashamed of my present , after reading and talking about being good this morning , so I ran round the corner and changed it the minute I was up : and I &apos;m _ so _ glad , for mine is the <unk> now . &quot;
Another bang of the <unk> sent the basket under the sofa , and the girls to the table , eager for breakfast .
&quot; Merry Christmas , Marmee !
Many of them !
Thank you for our books ; we read some , and mean to every day , &quot; they cried , in chorus .
&quot; Merry Christmas , little daughters !
I &apos;m glad you began at once , and hope you will keep on .
But I want to say one word before we sit down .
Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little <unk> baby .
Six children are <unk> into one bed to keep from <unk> , for they have no fire .
There is nothing to eat over there ; and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering <unk> and cold .
My girls , will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present ? &quot;
They were all unusually hungry , having waited nearly an hour , and for a minute no one spoke ; only a minute , for Jo exclaimed <unk> , -- &quot; I &apos;m so glad you came before we began ! &quot;
&quot; May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children ? &quot;
asked Beth , eagerly .
&quot; _ I _ shall take the cream and the <unk> , &quot; added Amy , heroically giving up the articles she most liked .
Meg was already covering the <unk> , and <unk> the bread into one big plate .
&quot; I thought you &apos;d do it , &quot; said Mrs. March , smiling as if satisfied .
&quot; You shall all go and help me , and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast , and make it up at <unk> . &quot;
They were soon ready , and the procession set out .
Fortunately it was early , and they went through back <unk> , so few people saw them , and no one laughed at the queer party .
&#91; Illustration : The procession set out &#93; A poor , bare , miserable room it was , with broken windows , no fire , ragged <unk> , a sick mother , wailing baby , and a group of pale , hungry children cuddled under one old <unk> , trying to keep warm .
How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in !
&quot; <unk> , <unk> Gott !
it is good angels come to us ! &quot;
said the poor woman , crying for joy .
&quot; <unk> angels in <unk> and <unk> , &quot; said Jo , and set them laughing .
In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there .
Hannah , who had carried wood , made a fire , and stopped up the broken <unk> with old hats and her own cloak .
Mrs. March gave the mother tea and <unk> , and comforted her with promises of help , while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own .
The girls , meantime , spread the table , set the children round the fire , and fed them like so many hungry birds , <unk> , talking , and trying to understand the funny broken English .
&quot; <unk> ist <unk> ! &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
cried the poor things , as they ate , and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze .
The girls had never been called angel children before , and thought it very agreeable , especially Jo , who had been considered a &quot; Sancho &quot; ever since she was born .
That was a very happy breakfast , though they didn &apos;t get any of it ; and when they went away , leaving comfort behind , I think there were not in all the city four <unk> people than the hungry little girls who gave away their <unk> and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning .
&quot; That &apos;s loving our neighbor better than ourselves , and I like it , &quot; said Meg , as they set out their presents , while their mother was upstairs <unk> clothes for the poor Hummels .
Not a very splendid show , but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles ; and the tall vase of red roses , white <unk> , and <unk> vines , which stood in the middle , gave quite an elegant air to the table .
&quot; She &apos;s coming !
<unk> up , Beth !
<unk> the door , Amy !
Three cheers for Marmee ! &quot;
cried Jo , prancing about , while Meg went to <unk> mother to the seat of honor .
Beth played her <unk> march , Amy threw open the door , and Meg <unk> escort with great dignity .
Mrs. March was both surprised and touched ; and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents , and read the little notes which accompanied them .
The slippers went on at once , a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket , well <unk> with Amy &apos;s cologne , the rose was fastened in her bosom , and the nice gloves were pronounced a &quot; perfect fit . &quot;
There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and <unk> , in the simple , loving fashion which makes these <unk> so pleasant at the time , so sweet to remember long afterward , and then all fell to work .
The morning <unk> and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening <unk> .
Being still too young to go often to the theatre , and not rich enough to afford any great <unk> for private performances , the girls put their wits to work , <unk> being the mother of invention , <unk> whatever they needed .
Very clever were some of their <unk> , <unk> <unk> , antique lamps made of old-fashioned <unk> covered with silver paper , gorgeous <unk> of old cotton , <unk> with tin <unk> from a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> covered with the same useful <unk> bits , left in sheets when the <unk> of tin <unk> were cut out .
The furniture was used to being turned topsy-turvy , and the big <unk> was the scene of many innocent <unk> .
No gentlemen were <unk> ; so Jo played <unk> parts to her heart &apos;s content , and took immense satisfaction in a pair of <unk> boots given her by a friend , who knew a lady who knew an <unk> .
These boots , an old <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> once used by an artist for some picture , were Jo &apos;s chief treasures , and appeared on all occasions .
The <unk> of the company made it necessary for the two <unk> actors to take several parts apiece ; and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts , whisking in and out of various costumes , and <unk> the stage <unk> .
It was excellent <unk> for their <unk> , a harmless amusement , and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle , lonely , or spent in less profitable society .
On Christmas night , a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the <unk> , and sat before the blue and yellow <unk> curtains in a most flattering state of <unk> .
There was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain , a trifle of <unk> , and an occasional <unk> from Amy , who was apt to get <unk> in the excitement of the moment .
Presently a bell sounded , the curtains flew apart , and the <unk> <unk> began .
&quot; A gloomy wood , &quot; according to the one <unk> , was represented by a few <unk> in pots , green <unk> on the floor , and a cave in the distance .
This cave was made with a <unk> for a roof , <unk> for walls ; and in it was a small <unk> in full <unk> , with a black pot on it , and an old witch bending over it .
The stage was dark , and the glow of the <unk> had a fine effect , especially as real <unk> issued from the <unk> when the witch took off the cover .
A moment was allowed for the first thrill to <unk> ; then Hugo , the villain , stalked in with a <unk> sword at his side , a <unk> hat , black beard , mysterious cloak , and the boots .
After <unk> to and fro in much <unk> , he struck his forehead , and burst out in a wild strain , singing of his <unk> to Roderigo , his love for Zara , and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other .
The gruff <unk> of Hugo &apos;s voice , with an occasional shout when his feelings <unk> him , were very impressive , and the audience <unk> the moment he paused for breath .
<unk> with the air of one accustomed to public praise , he stole to the <unk> , and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding &quot; What <unk> , <unk> !
I need thee ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face &#93; Out came Meg , with gray horse-hair hanging about her face , a red and black <unk> , a staff , and <unk> signs upon her cloak .
Hugo demanded a <unk> to make Zara adore him , and one to destroy Roderigo .
Hagar , in a fine dramatic melody , promised both , and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love <unk> : -- &quot; <unk> , <unk> , from thy home , <unk> <unk> , I bid thee come !
<unk> of roses , fed on dew , <unk> and potions <unk> thou <unk> ?
Bring me here , with <unk> speed , The fragrant <unk> which I need ; Make it sweet and <unk> and strong , <unk> , answer now my song ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : A little figure in cloudy white &#93; A soft strain of music sounded , and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white , with <unk> wings , golden hair , and a garland of roses on its head .
<unk> a <unk> , it sang , -- &quot; <unk> I come , From my airy home , <unk> in the silver moon .
Take the magic spell , And use it well , Or its power will <unk> soon ! &quot;
And , dropping a small , <unk> bottle at the witch &apos;s feet , the spirit vanished .
Another <unk> from Hagar produced another <unk> , --not a lovely one ; for , with a bang , an ugly black <unk> appeared , and , having croaked a reply , tossed a dark bottle at Hugo , and disappeared with a <unk> laugh .
Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots , Hugo departed ; and Hagar informed the audience that , as he had killed a few of her friends in times past , she has <unk> him , and <unk> to <unk> his plans , and be <unk> on him .
Then the curtain fell , and the audience reposed and ate <unk> while discussing the <unk> of the play .
A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again ; but when it became evident what a <unk> of <unk> had been got up , no one murmured at the delay .
It was truly <unk> !
A tower rose to the <unk> ; <unk> up appeared a window , with a lamp burning at it , and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver dress , waiting for Roderigo .
He came in gorgeous array , with <unk> cap , red cloak , chestnut <unk> , a <unk> , and the boots , of course .
<unk> at the foot of the tower , he sang a serenade in <unk> <unk> .
Zara replied , and , after a musical <unk> , consented to fly .
Then came the grand effect of the play .
Roderigo produced a <unk> , with five steps to it , threw up one end , and invited Zara to <unk> .
<unk> she crept from her <unk> , put her hand on Roderigo &apos;s shoulder , and was about to leap gracefully down , when , &quot; <unk> !
alas for Zara ! &quot;
she forgot her train , --it caught in the window ; the tower <unk> , leaned forward , fell with a crash , and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins !
A <unk> <unk> arose as the <unk> boots waved wildly from the wreck , and a golden head emerged , exclaiming , &quot; I told you so !
I told you so ! &quot;
With wonderful presence of mind , Don Pedro , the cruel sire , rushed in , dragged out his daughter , with a hasty aside , -- &quot; Don &apos;t laugh !
Act as if it was all right ! &quot;
--and , <unk> Roderigo up , <unk> him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn .
Though decidedly shaken by the fall of the tower upon him , Roderigo defied the old gentleman , and refused to stir .
This <unk> example fired Zara : she also defied her sire , and he ordered them both to the deepest <unk> of the castle .
A stout little <unk> came in with chains , and led them away , looking very much frightened , and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made .
Act third was the castle hall ; and here Hagar appeared , having come to free the lovers and finish Hugo .
She <unk> him coming , and <unk> ; sees him put the potions into two cups of wine , and bid the timid little servant &quot; <unk> them to the <unk> in their <unk> , and tell them I shall come <unk> . &quot;
The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something , and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless .
<unk> , the &quot; <unk> , &quot; carries them away , and Hagar <unk> back the cup which holds the <unk> meant for Roderigo .
Hugo , getting <unk> after a long <unk> , <unk> it , <unk> his wits , and , after a good deal of <unk> and <unk> , falls flat and dies ; while Hagar <unk> him what she has done in a song of <unk> power and melody .
This was a truly thrilling scene , though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long hair rather <unk> the effect of the villain &apos;s death .
He was called before the curtain , and with great propriety appeared , leading Hagar , whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together .
Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of <unk> himself , because he has been told that Zara has deserted him .
Just as the <unk> is at his heart , a lovely song is sung under his window , <unk> him that Zara is true , but in danger , and he can save her , if he will .
A key is thrown in , which <unk> the door , and in a <unk> of rapture he tears off his chains , and <unk> away to find and rescue his <unk> .
Act <unk> opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro .
He wishes her to go into a <unk> , but she won &apos;t hear of it ; and , after a touching appeal , is about to faint , when Roderigo <unk> in and <unk> her hand .
Don Pedro <unk> , because he is not rich .
They shout and <unk> tremendously , but cannot agree , and Roderigo is about to bear away the exhausted Zara , when the timid servant <unk> with a letter and a bag from Hagar , who has mysteriously disappeared .
The latter <unk> the party that she <unk> <unk> wealth to the young pair , and an awful doom to Don Pedro , if he doesn &apos;t make them happy .
The bag is opened , and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage , till it is quite glorified with the <unk> .
This entirely <unk> the &quot; stern sire &quot; : he <unk> without a murmur , all join in a joyful chorus , and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro &apos;s blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace .
&#91; Illustration : The lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro &apos;s blessing &#93; <unk> applause followed , but received an unexpected check ; for the <unk> , on which the &quot; <unk> &quot; was built , suddenly shut up , and <unk> the enthusiastic audience .
Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to the rescue , and all were taken out <unk> , though many were <unk> with laughter .
The excitement had hardly subsided , when Hannah appeared , with &quot; Mrs. March &apos;s compliments , and would the ladies walk down to supper . &quot;
This was a surprise , even to the actors ; and , when they saw the table , they looked at one another in rapturous amazement .
It was like Marmee to get up a little treat for them ; but anything so fine as this was <unk> since the departed days of plenty .
There was ice-cream , <unk> two dishes of it , pink and white , --and cake and fruit and distracting French bonbons , and , in the middle of the table , four great bouquets of <unk> flowers !
It quite took their breath away ; and they stared first at the table and then at their mother , who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely .
&quot; Is it fairies ? &quot;
asked Amy , &quot; It &apos;s <unk> <unk> , &quot; said Beth .
&quot; Mother did it &quot; ; and Meg smiled her sweetest , in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows .
&quot; Aunt March had a good fit , and sent the supper , &quot; cried Jo , with a sudden inspiration .
&quot; All wrong .
Old Mr. Laurence sent it , &quot; replied Mrs. March .
&quot; The Laurence boy &apos;s grandfather !
What in the world put such a thing into his head ?
We don &apos;t know him ! &quot;
exclaimed Meg .
&quot; Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party .
He is an odd old gentleman , but that pleased him .
He knew my father , years ago ; and he sent me a polite note this afternoon , saying he hoped I would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day .
I could not refuse ; and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the <unk> breakfast . &quot;
&quot; That boy put it into his head , I know he did !
He &apos;s a capital fellow , and I wish we could get acquainted .
He looks as if he &apos;d like to know us ; but he &apos;s bashful , and Meg is so prim she won &apos;t let me speak to him when we pass , &quot; said Jo , as the plates went round , and the ice began to melt out of sight , with &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
and &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
of satisfaction .
&quot; You mean the people who live in the big house next door , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
asked one of the girls .
&quot; My mother knows old Mr. Laurence ; but says he &apos;s very proud , and doesn &apos;t like to <unk> with his neighbors .
He keeps his grandson shut up , when he isn &apos;t riding or walking with his tutor , and makes him study very hard .
We invited him to our party , but he didn &apos;t come .
Mother says he &apos;s very nice , though he never speaks to us girls . &quot;
&quot; Our cat ran away once , and he brought her back , and we talked over the fence , and were getting on capitally , --all about cricket , and so on , <unk> he saw Meg coming , and walked off .
I mean to know him some day ; for he needs fun , I &apos;m sure he does , &quot; said Jo decidedly .
&#91; Illustration : We talked over the fence &#93; &quot; I like his manners , and he looks like a little gentleman ; so I &apos;ve no objection to your knowing him , if a proper opportunity comes .
He brought the flowers himself ; and I should have asked him in , if I had been sure what was going on upstairs .
He looked so wistful as he went away , hearing the frolic , and evidently having none of his own . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a mercy you didn &apos;t , mother ! &quot;
laughed Jo , looking at her boots .
&quot; But we &apos;ll have another play , some time , that he _ can _ see .
Perhaps he &apos;ll help act ; wouldn &apos;t that be jolly ? &quot;
&quot; I never had such a fine bouquet before !
How pretty it is ! &quot;
And Meg examined her flowers with great interest .
&quot; They _ are _ lovely !
But Beth &apos;s roses are sweeter to me , &quot; said Mrs. March , <unk> the <unk> posy in her <unk> .
Beth nestled up to her , and whispered softly , &quot; I wish I could send my bunch to father .
I &apos;m afraid he isn &apos;t having such a merry Christmas as we are . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : <unk> apples and crying over the &quot; Heir of Redclyffe &quot; &#93; <unk> .

&quot; Jo !
Jo !
where are you ? &quot;
cried Meg , at the foot of the garret stairs .
&quot; Here ! &quot;
answered a <unk> voice from above ; and , running up , Meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the &quot; Heir of Redclyffe , &quot; wrapped up in a <unk> on an old <unk> sofa by the sunny window .
This was Jo &apos;s favorite refuge ; and here she loved to <unk> with half a dozen <unk> and a nice book , to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet <unk> who lived near by , and didn &apos;t mind her a particle .
As Meg appeared , Scrabble whisked into his hole .
Jo shook the tears off her cheeks , and waited to hear the news .
&quot; Such fun !
only see !
a regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for to-morrow night ! &quot;
cried Meg , waving the precious paper , and then proceeding to read it , with girlish delight .
&quot; &apos; Mrs.
Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a little dance on New-Year &apos;s Eve . &apos;
Marmee is willing we should go ; now what _ shall _ we wear ? &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s the use of asking that , when you know we shall wear our <unk> , because we haven &apos;t got anything else ? &quot;
answered Jo , with her mouth full .
&quot; If I only had a silk ! &quot;
sighed Meg .
&quot; Mother says I may when I &apos;m eighteen , perhaps ; but two years is an everlasting time to wait . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure our <unk> look like silk , and they are nice enough for us .
Yours is as good as new , but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine .
Whatever shall I do ?
the burn shows badly , and I can &apos;t take any out . &quot;
&quot; You must sit still all you can , and keep your back out of sight ; the front is all right .
I shall have a new ribbon for my hair , and Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin , and my new slippers are lovely , and my gloves will do , though they aren &apos;t as nice as I &apos;d like . &quot;
&quot; Mine are spoilt with lemonade , and I can &apos;t get any new ones , so I shall have to go without , &quot; said Jo , who never troubled herself much about dress .
&quot; You _ must _ have gloves , or I won &apos;t go , &quot; cried Meg decidedly .
&quot; <unk> are more important than anything else ; you can &apos;t dance without them , and if you don &apos;t I should be _ so _ <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Then I &apos;ll stay still .
I don &apos;t care much for company dancing ; it &apos;s no fun to go <unk> round ; I like to fly about and cut <unk> . &quot;
&quot; You can &apos;t ask mother for new ones , they are so <unk> , and you are so careless .
She said , when you spoilt the others , that she shouldn &apos;t get you any more this winter .
Can &apos;t you make them do ? &quot;
asked Meg anxiously .
&quot; I can hold them crumpled up in my hand , so no one will know how stained they are ; that &apos;s all I can do .
No !
I &apos;ll tell you how we can <unk> wear one good one and carry a bad one ; don &apos;t you see ? &quot;
&quot; Your hands are bigger than mine , and you will stretch my glove dreadfully , &quot; began Meg , whose gloves were a tender point with her .
&quot; Then I &apos;ll go without .
I don &apos;t care what people say ! &quot;
cried Jo , taking up her book .
&quot; You may have it , you may !
only don &apos;t <unk> it , and do behave nicely .
Don &apos;t put your hands behind you , or stare , or say &apos; Christopher Columbus ! &apos;
will you ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t worry about me ; I &apos;ll be as prim as I can , and not get into any scrapes , if I can help it .
Now go and answer your note , and let me finish this splendid story . &quot;
So Meg went away to &quot; accept with thanks , &quot; look over her dress , and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace <unk> ; while Jo finished her story , her four apples , and had a game of <unk> with Scrabble .
On New-Year &apos;s Eve the parlor was deserted , for the two younger girls played <unk> , and the two elder were absorbed in the <unk> business of &quot; getting ready for the party . &quot;
Simple as the <unk> were , there was a great deal of running up and down , laughing and talking , and at one time a strong smell of burnt hair pervaded the house .
Meg wanted a few curls about her face , and Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs .
&#91; Illustration : Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks &#93; &quot; <unk> they to smoke like that ? &quot;
asked Beth , from her perch on the bed .
&quot; It &apos;s the <unk> drying , &quot; replied Jo .
&quot; What a queer smell !
it &apos;s like burnt feathers , &quot; observed Amy , smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air .
&quot; There , now I &apos;ll take off the papers and you &apos;ll see a cloud of little <unk> , &quot; said Jo , putting down the tongs .
She did take off the papers , but no cloud of <unk> appeared , for the hair came with the papers , and the horrified <unk> laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim .
&quot; Oh , oh , oh !
what _ have _ you done ?
I &apos;m spoilt !
I can &apos;t go !
My hair , oh , my hair ! &quot;
<unk> Meg , looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead .
&quot; Just my <unk> !
you shouldn &apos;t have asked me to do it ; I always spoil everything .
I &apos;m so sorry , but the tongs were too hot , and so I &apos;ve made a mess , &quot; groaned poor Jo , regarding the black <unk> with tears of regret .
&quot; It isn &apos;t spoilt ; just frizzle it , and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit , and it will look like the last fashion .
I &apos;ve seen many girls do it so , &quot; said Amy consolingly .
&quot; <unk> me right for trying to be fine .
I wish I &apos;d let my hair alone , &quot; cried Meg petulantly .
&quot; So do I , it was so smooth and pretty .
But it will soon grow out again , &quot; said Beth , coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep .
After various <unk> <unk> , Meg was finished at last , and by the <unk> exertions of the family Jo &apos;s hair was got up and her dress on .
They looked very well in their simple suits , <unk> in silvery <unk> , with a blue velvet <unk> , lace <unk> , and the pearl pin ; Jo in <unk> , with a stiff , gentlemanly linen collar , and a white <unk> or two for her only ornament .
Each put on one nice light glove , and carried one <unk> one , and all pronounced the effect &quot; quite easy and fine . &quot;
Meg &apos;s high-heeled slippers were very tight , and hurt her , though she would not own it , and Jo &apos;s nineteen hair-pins all seemed stuck straight into her head , which was not exactly comfortable ; but , dear me , let us be elegant or die !
&quot; Have a good time , <unk> ! &quot;
said Mrs. March , as the sisters went <unk> down the walk .
&quot; Don &apos;t eat much supper , and come away at eleven , when I send Hannah for you . &quot;
As the gate clashed behind them , a voice cried from a window , -- &quot; Girls , girls !
_ have _ you both got nice <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , yes , <unk> nice , and Meg has cologne on hers , &quot; cried Jo , adding , with a laugh , as they went on , &quot; I do believe Marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake . &quot;
&quot; It is one of her aristocratic tastes , and quite proper , for a real lady is always known by neat boots , gloves , and handkerchief , &quot; replied Meg , who had a good many little &quot; aristocratic tastes &quot; of her own .
&quot; Now don &apos;t forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight , Jo .
Is my sash right ?
and does my hair look _ very _ bad ? &quot;
said Meg , as she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner &apos;s <unk> , after a <unk> prink .
&quot; I know I shall forget .
If you see me doing anything wrong , just remind me by a <unk> , will you ? &quot;
returned Jo , giving her collar a <unk> and her head a hasty <unk> .
&quot; No , winking isn &apos;t <unk> ; I &apos;ll lift my eyebrows if anything is wrong , and nod if you are all right .
Now hold your shoulders straight , and take short steps , and don &apos;t shake hands if you are introduced to any one : it isn &apos;t the thing . &quot;
&quot; How _ do _ you learn all the proper ways ?
I never can .
Isn &apos;t that music gay ? &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Mrs. Gardiner greeted them &#93; Down they went , feeling a trifle timid , for they seldom went to parties , and , <unk> as this little gathering was , it was an event to them .
Mrs. Gardiner , a stately old lady , greeted them kindly , and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters .
Meg knew Sallie , and was at her ease very soon ; but Jo , who didn &apos;t care much for girls or girlish gossip , stood about , with her back carefully against the wall , and felt as much out of place as a colt in a <unk> .
Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room , and she longed to go and join them , for skating was one of the joys of her life .
She telegraphed her wish to Meg , but the eyebrows went up so <unk> that she dared not stir .
No one came to talk to her , and one by one the group near her <unk> away , till she was left alone .
She could not <unk> about and amuse herself , for the burnt breadth would show , so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began .
Meg was asked at once , and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their <unk> suffered <unk> .
Jo saw a big red-headed youth approaching her corner , and fearing he meant to <unk> her , she slipped into a curtained recess , intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace .
Unfortunately , another bashful person had chosen the same refuge ; for , as the curtain fell behind her , she found herself face to face with the &quot; Laurence boy . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : <unk> to face with the Laurence boy &#93; &quot; Dear me , I didn &apos;t know any one was here ! &quot;
stammered Jo , preparing to back out as <unk> as she had bounced in .
But the boy laughed , and said pleasantly , though he looked a little startled , -- &quot; Don &apos;t mind me ; stay , if you like . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;n&apos;t I disturb you ? &quot;
&quot; Not a bit ; I only came here because I don &apos;t know many people , and felt rather strange at first , you know . &quot;
&quot; So did I.
Don &apos;t go away , please , unless you &apos;d rather . &quot;
The boy sat down again and looked at his <unk> , till Jo said , trying to be polite and easy , -- &quot; I think I &apos;ve had the pleasure of seeing you before ; you live near us , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Next door &quot; ; and he looked up and laughed outright , for Jo &apos;s prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home .
That put Jo at her ease ; and she laughed too , as she said , in her <unk> way , -- &quot; We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present . &quot;
&quot; Grandpa sent it . &quot;
&quot; But you put it into his head , didn &apos;t you , now ? &quot;
&quot; How is your cat , Miss March ? &quot;
asked the boy , trying to look sober , while his black eyes shone with fun .
&quot; <unk> , thank you , Mr. Laurence ; but I am not Miss March , I &apos;m only Jo , &quot; returned the young lady .
&quot; I &apos;m not Mr. Laurence , I &apos;m only Laurie . &quot;
&quot; Laurie Laurence , <unk> an odd name ! &quot;
&quot; My first name is Theodore , but I don &apos;t like it , for the fellows called me <unk> , so I made them say Laurie instead . &quot;
&quot; I hate my name , <unk> sentimental !
I wish every one would say Jo , instead of Josephine .
How did you make the boys stop calling you <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; I <unk> &apos; em . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t <unk> Aunt March , so I suppose I shall have to bear it &quot; ; and Jo resigned herself with a sigh .
&quot; Don &apos;t you like to dance , Miss Jo ? &quot;
asked Laurie , looking as if he thought the name suited her .
&quot; I like it well enough if there is plenty of room , and every one is lively .
In a place like this I &apos;m sure to upset something , tread on people &apos;s toes , or do something dreadful , so I keep out of mischief , and let Meg sail about .
Don &apos;t you dance ? &quot;
&quot; Sometimes ; you see I &apos;ve been abroad a good many years , and haven &apos;t been into company enough yet to know how you do things here . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
cried Jo .
&quot; Oh , tell me about it !
I love dearly to hear people describe their travels . &quot;
Laurie didn &apos;t seem to know where to begin ; but Jo &apos;s eager questions soon set him going , and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay , where the boys never wore hats , and had a <unk> of boats on the lake , and for holiday fun went walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers .
&quot; Don &apos;t I wish I &apos;d been there ! &quot;
cried Jo .
&quot; Did you go to Paris ? &quot;
&quot; We spent last winter there . &quot;
&quot; Can you talk French ? &quot;
&quot; We were not allowed to speak any thing else at Vevay . &quot;
&quot; Do say some !
I can read it , but can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> en <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
said Laurie good-naturedly .
&quot; How nicely you do it !
Let me see , <unk> said , &apos; Who is the young lady in the pretty slippers , &apos; didn &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , mademoiselle . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s my sister Margaret , and you knew it was !
Do you think she is pretty ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; she makes me think of the German girls , she looks so fresh and quiet , and dances like a lady . &quot;
Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister , and stored it up to repeat to Meg .
Both peeped and criticised and chatted , till they felt like old acquaintances .
Laurie &apos;s bashfulness soon wore off ; for Jo &apos;s gentlemanly <unk> amused and set him at his ease , and Jo was her merry self again , because her dress was forgotten , and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her .
She liked the &quot; Laurence boy &quot; better than ever , and took several good looks at him , so that she might describe him to the girls ; for they had no brothers , very few <unk> cousins , and boys were almost unknown creatures to them .
&quot; <unk> black hair ; brown skin ; big , black eyes ; handsome nose ; fine teeth ; small hands and feet ; <unk> than I am ; very polite , for a boy , and altogether jolly .
<unk> how old he is ? &quot;
It was on the <unk> of Jo &apos;s tongue to ask ; but she checked herself in time , and , with unusual tact , tried to find out in a <unk> way .
&quot; I suppose you are going to college soon ?
I see you <unk> away at your books , <unk> , I mean studying hard &quot; ; and Jo blushed at the dreadful &quot; <unk> &quot; which had escaped her .
Laurie smiled , but didn &apos;t seem <unk> , and answered , with a shrug , -- &quot; Not for a year or two ; I won &apos;t go before seventeen , <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Aren &apos;t you but fifteen ? &quot;
asked Jo , looking at the tall lad , whom she had imagined seventeen already .
&quot; <unk> , next month . &quot;
&quot; How I wish I was going to college !
You don &apos;t look as if you liked it . &quot;
&quot; I hate it !
Nothing but <unk> or <unk> .
And I don &apos;t like the way fellows do either , in this country . &quot;
&quot; What do you like ? &quot;
&quot; To live in Italy , and to enjoy myself in my own way . &quot;
Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was ; but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them ; so she changed the subject by saying , as her foot kept time , &quot; That &apos;s a splendid <unk> !
Why don &apos;t you go and try it ? &quot;
&quot; If you will come too , &quot; he answered , with a gallant little bow .
&quot; I can &apos;t ; for I told Meg I wouldn &apos;t , <unk> &quot; There Jo stopped , and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh .
&quot; Because what ? &quot;
asked Laurie curiously .
&quot; You won &apos;t tell ? &quot;
&quot; Never ! &quot;
&quot; Well , I have a bad <unk> of standing before the fire , and so I burn my <unk> , and I scorched this one ; and , though it &apos;s nicely mended , it shows , and Meg told me to keep still , so no one would see it .
You may laugh , if you want to ; it is funny , I know . &quot;
But Laurie didn &apos;t laugh ; he only looked down a minute , and the expression of his face puzzled Jo , when he said very gently , -- &quot; Never mind that ; I &apos;ll tell you how we can manage : there &apos;s a long hall out there , and we can dance <unk> , and no one will see us .
Please come ? &quot;
Jo thanked him , and gladly went , wishing she had two neat gloves , when she saw the nice , <unk> ones her partner wore .
The hall was empty , and they had a grand <unk> ; for Laurie danced well , and taught her the German step , which delighted Jo , being full of swing and spring .
When the music stopped , they sat down on the stairs to get their breath ; and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students &apos; festival at <unk> , when Meg appeared in search of her sister .
She beckoned , and Jo reluctantly followed her into a <unk> , where she found her on a sofa , holding her foot , and looking pale .
&#91; Illustration : They sat down on the stairs &#93; &quot; I &apos;ve <unk> my ankle .
That stupid high heel turned , and gave me a sad <unk> .
It aches so , I can hardly stand , and I don &apos;t know how I &apos;m ever going to get home , &quot; she said , rocking to and fro in pain .
&quot; I knew you &apos;d hurt your feet with those silly shoes .
I &apos;m sorry .
But I don &apos;t see what you can do , except get a carriage , or stay here all night , &quot; answered Jo , softly <unk> the poor ankle as she spoke .
&quot; I can &apos;t have a carriage , without its <unk> ever so much .
I dare say I can &apos;t get one at all ; for most people come in their own , and it &apos;s a long way to the <unk> , and no one to send . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll go . &quot;
&quot; No , indeed !
It &apos;s past nine , and dark as <unk> .
I can &apos;t stop here , for the house is full .
Sallie has some girls <unk> with her .
I &apos;ll rest till Hannah comes , and then do the best I can . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll ask Laurie ; he will go , &quot; said Jo , looking relieved as the idea occurred to her .
&quot; Mercy , no !
Don &apos;t ask or tell any one .
Get me my rubbers , and put these slippers with our things .
I can &apos;t dance any more ; but as soon as supper is over , watch for Hannah , and tell me the minute she comes . &quot;
&quot; They are going out to supper now .
I &apos;ll stay with you ; I &apos;d rather . &quot;
&quot; No , dear , run along , and bring me some coffee .
I &apos;m so tired , I can &apos;t stir ! &quot;
So Meg <unk> , with rubbers well hidden , and Jo went <unk> away to the dining-room , which she found after going into a china-closet , and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little private refreshment .
<unk> a <unk> at the table , she <unk> the coffee , which she immediately <unk> , <unk> making the front of her dress as bad as the back .
&quot; Oh , dear , what a <unk> I am ! &quot;
exclaimed Jo , finishing Meg &apos;s glove by <unk> her gown with it .
&quot; Can I help you ? &quot;
said a friendly voice ; and there was Laurie , with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other .
&quot; I was trying to get something for Meg , who is very tired , and some one shook me ; and here I am , in a nice state , &quot; answered Jo , glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the <unk> glove .
&quot; Too bad !
I was looking for some one to give this to .
May I take it to your sister ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , thank you !
I &apos;ll show you where she is .
I don &apos;t offer to take it myself , for I should only get into another scrape if I did . &quot;
Jo led the way ; and , as if used to waiting on ladies , Laurie drew up a little table , brought a second <unk> of coffee and ice for Jo , and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a &quot; nice boy . &quot;
They had a merry time over the bonbons and <unk> , and were in the midst of a quiet game of &quot; <unk> , &quot; with two or three other young people who had strayed in , when Hannah appeared .
Meg forgot her foot , and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo , with an exclamation of pain .
&quot; Hush !
Don &apos;t say anything , &quot; she whispered , adding aloud , &quot; It &apos;s nothing .
I turned my foot a little , that &apos;s all &quot; ; and <unk> <unk> to put her things on .
Hannah scolded , Meg cried , and Jo was at her wits &apos; end , till she decided to take things into her own hands .
<unk> out , she ran down , and , finding a servant , asked if he could get her a carriage .
It happened to be a <unk> <unk> , who knew nothing about the neighborhood ; and Jo was looking round for help , when Laurie , who had heard what she said , came up , and offered his grandfather &apos;s carriage , which had just come for him , he said .
&quot; It &apos;s so early !
You can &apos;t mean to go yet ? &quot;
began Jo , looking relieved , but <unk> to accept the offer .
&quot; I always go early , --I do , truly !
Please let me take you home ?
It &apos;s all on my way , you know , and it <unk> , they say . &quot;
That settled it ; and , telling him of Meg &apos;s mishap , Jo gratefully accepted , and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party .
Hannah hated rain as much as a cat does ; so she made no trouble , and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage , feeling very festive and elegant .
Laurie went on the box ; so Meg could keep her foot up , and the girls talked over their party in freedom .
&quot; I had a capital time .
Did you ? &quot;
asked Jo , rumpling up her hair , and making herself comfortable .
&quot; Yes , till I hurt myself .
Sallie &apos;s friend , Annie Moffat , took a fancy to me , and asked me to come and spend a week with her , when Sallie does .
She is going in the spring , when the opera comes ; and it will be perfectly splendid , if mother only lets me go , &quot; answered Meg , cheering up at the thought .
&quot; I saw you dancing with the red-headed man I ran away from .
Was he nice ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , very !
His hair is <unk> , not red ; and he was very polite , and I had a delicious <unk> with him . &quot;
&quot; He looked like a <unk> in a fit , when he did the new step .
Laurie and I couldn &apos;t help laughing .
Did you hear us ? &quot;
&quot; No ; but it was very rude .
What _ were _ you about all that time , hidden away there ? &quot;
Jo told her adventures , and , by the time she had finished , they were at home .
With many thanks , they said &quot; Good night , &quot; and crept in , hoping to disturb no one ; but the instant their door <unk> , two little <unk> <unk> up , and two sleepy but eager voices cried out , -- &quot; Tell about the party !
tell about the party ! &quot;
With what Meg called &quot; a great want of manners , &quot; Jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls ; and they soon subsided , after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening .
&quot; I declare , it really seems like being a fine young lady , to come home from the party in a carriage , and sit in my dressing-gown , with a maid to wait on me , &quot; said Meg , as Jo bound up her foot with <unk> , and brushed her hair .
&quot; I don &apos;t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do , in spite of our burnt hair , old gowns , one glove apiece , and tight slippers that <unk> our <unk> when we are silly enough to wear them . &quot;
And I think Jo was quite right .
&#91; Illustration : Tell about the party &#93; &#91; Illustration : The kitten stuck like a burr just out of reach &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
&quot; Oh dear , how hard it does seem to take up our <unk> and go on , &quot; sighed Meg , the morning after the party ; for , now the <unk> were over , the week of <unk> did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked .
&quot; I wish it was Christmas or New-Year all the time ; wouldn &apos;t it be fun ? &quot;
answered Jo , <unk> dismally .
&quot; We shouldn &apos;t enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now .
But it does seem so nice to have little <unk> and bouquets , and go to parties , and drive home , and read and rest , and not work .
It &apos;s like other people , you know , and I always envy girls who do such things ; I &apos;m so fond of luxury , &quot; said Meg , trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby .
&quot; Well , we can &apos;t have it , so don &apos;t let us <unk> , but shoulder our bundles and <unk> along as cheerfully as Marmee does .
I &apos;m sure Aunt March is a regular Old <unk> of the <unk> to me , but I suppose when I &apos;ve learned to carry her without complaining , she will tumble off , or get so light that I sha &apos;n&apos;t mind her . &quot;
This idea <unk> Jo &apos;s fancy , and put her in good spirits ; but Meg didn &apos;t brighten , for her burden , <unk> of four spoilt children , seemed <unk> than ever .
She hadn &apos;t heart enough even to make herself pretty , as usual , by putting on a blue <unk> , and dressing her hair in the most becoming way .
&quot; Where &apos;s the use of looking nice , when no one sees me but those cross <unk> , and no one cares whether I &apos;m pretty or not ? &quot;
she muttered , shutting her drawer with a <unk> .
&quot; I shall have to <unk> and <unk> all my days , with only little bits of fun now and then , and get old and ugly and sour , because I &apos;m poor , and can &apos;t enjoy my life as other girls do .
It &apos;s a shame ! &quot;
So Meg went down , wearing an injured look , and wasn &apos;t at all agreeable at <unk> .
Every one seemed rather out of sorts , and inclined to croak .
Beth had a headache , and lay on the sofa , trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens ; Amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned , and she couldn &apos;t find her rubbers ; Jo _ would _ whistle and make a great racket getting ready ; Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter , which must go at once ; and Hannah had the <unk> , for being up late didn &apos;t suit her .
&quot; There never _ was _ such a cross family ! &quot;
cried Jo , losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand , broken both <unk> , and sat down upon her hat .
&quot; You &apos;re the <unk> person in it ! &quot;
returned Amy , washing out the sum , that was all wrong , with the tears that had fallen on her slate .
&quot; Beth , if you don &apos;t keep these horrid cats down cellar I &apos;ll have them <unk> , &quot; exclaimed Meg angrily , as she tried to get <unk> of the kitten , which had scrambled up her back , and stuck like a burr just out of reach .
Jo laughed , Meg scolded , Beth implored , and Amy <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t remember how much nine times twelve was .
&quot; Girls , girls , do be quiet one minute !
I _ must _ get this off by the early mail , and you drive me distracted with your worry , &quot; cried Mrs. March , <unk> out the third spoilt sentence in her letter .
There was a momentary lull , broken by Hannah , who stalked in , laid two hot turn-overs on the table , and stalked out again .
These turn-overs were an institution ; and the girls called them &quot; <unk> , &quot; for they had no others , and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold <unk> .
Hannah never forgot to make them , no matter how busy or <unk> she might be , for the walk was long and <unk> ; the poor things got no other lunch , and were seldom home before two .
&quot; <unk> your cats , and get over your headache , Bethy .
Good-by , Marmee ; we are a set of rascals this morning , but we &apos;ll come home regular angels .
Now then , Meg ! &quot;
and Jo tramped away , feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do .
They always looked back before turning the corner , for their mother was always at the window , to nod and smile , and wave her hand to them .
Somehow it seemed as if they couldn &apos;t have got through the day without that ; for , whatever their mood might be , the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine .
&quot; If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us , it would serve us right , for more ungrateful <unk> than we are were never seen , &quot; cried Jo , taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind .
&quot; Don &apos;t use such dreadful <unk> , &quot; said Meg , from the <unk> of the <unk> in which she had <unk> herself like a <unk> sick of the world .
&quot; I like good strong words , that mean something , &quot; replied Jo , catching her hat as it took a leap off her head , <unk> to flying away altogether .
&quot; <unk> yourself any names you like ; but _ I _ am neither a <unk> nor a wretch , and I don &apos;t choose to be called so . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re a blighted being , and decidedly cross to-day because you can &apos;t sit in the lap of luxury all the time .
Poor dear , just wait till I make my fortune , and you shall revel in carriages and ice-cream and high-heeled slippers and <unk> and red-headed boys to dance with . &quot;
&quot; How ridiculous you are , Jo ! &quot;
but Meg laughed at the nonsense , and felt better in spite of herself .
&quot; <unk> for you I am ; for if I put on crushed airs , and tried to be dismal , as you do , we should be in a nice state .
Thank goodness , I can always find something funny to keep me up .
Don &apos;t croak any more , but come home jolly , there &apos;s a dear . &quot;
Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day , each going a different way , each hugging her little warm <unk> , and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather , hard work , and the <unk> desires of <unk> youth .
When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend , the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support , at least .
<unk> that they could not begin too early to <unk> energy , <unk> , and independence , their parents consented , and both fell to work with the hearty good-will which in spite of all obstacles , is sure to succeed at last .
Margaret found a place as nursery governess , and felt rich with her small salary .
As she said , she _ was _ &quot; fond of luxury , &quot; and her chief trouble was poverty .
She found it harder to bear than the others , because she could remember a time when home was beautiful , life full of ease and pleasure , and want of any kind unknown .
She tried not to be <unk> or discontented , but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things , gay friends , accomplishments , and a happy life .
At the Kings &apos; she daily saw all she wanted , for the children &apos;s older sisters were just out , and Meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty <unk> and bouquets , heard lively gossip about theatres , concerts , <unk> parties , and <unk> of all kinds , and saw money <unk> on trifles which would have been so precious to her .
Poor Meg seldom complained , but a sense of <unk> made her feel bitter toward every one sometimes , for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy .
Jo happened to suit Aunt March , who was lame , and needed an active person to wait upon her .
The <unk> old lady had offered to <unk> one of the girls when the troubles came , and was much offended because her offer was declined .
Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady &apos;s will ; but the unworldly Marches only said , -- &quot; We can &apos;t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes .
Rich or poor , we will keep together and be happy in one another . &quot;
The old lady wouldn &apos;t speak to them for a time , but <unk> to meet Jo at a friend &apos;s , something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady &apos;s fancy , and she proposed to take her for a companion .
This did not suit Jo at all ; but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared , and , to every one &apos;s surprise , got on remarkably well with her irascible <unk> .
There was an occasional <unk> , and once Jo had marched home , declaring she couldn &apos;t bear it any longer ; but Aunt March always cleared up quickly , and sent for her back again with such <unk> that she could not refuse , for in her heart she rather liked the <unk> old lady .
I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books , which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died .
Jo remembered the kind old gentleman , who used to let her <unk> <unk> and <unk> with his big <unk> , tell her stories about the queer pictures in his Latin books , and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street .
The dim , dusty room , with the busts staring down from the tall <unk> , the cosy chairs , the <unk> , and , best of all , the wilderness of books , in which she could <unk> where she liked , made the library a <unk> of bliss to her .
The moment Aunt March took her nap , or was busy with company , Jo hurried to this quiet place , and , <unk> herself up in the easy-chair , <unk> poetry , romance , history , travels , and pictures , like a regular <unk> .
But , like all happiness , it did not last long ; for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story , the sweetest verse of the song , or the most perilous <unk> of her traveller , a <unk> voice called , &quot; Josy-phine !
Josy-phine ! &quot;
and she had to leave her paradise to wind <unk> , wash the poodle , or read Belsham &apos;s <unk> by the hour together .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> herself up in the big chair &#93; Jo &apos;s ambition was to do something very splendid ; what it was she had no idea , as yet , but left it for time to tell her ; and , meanwhile , found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn &apos;t read , run , and ride as much as she liked .
A quick temper , sharp tongue , and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes , and her life was a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which were both <unk> and pathetic .
But the training she received at Aunt March &apos;s was just what she needed ; and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy , in spite of the perpetual &quot; Josy-phine ! &quot;
Beth was too bashful to go to school ; it had been tried , but she suffered so much that it was given up , and she did her lessons at home , with her father .
Even when he went away , and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to <unk> &apos; <unk> <unk> , Beth went faithfully on by herself , and did the best she could .
She was a housewifely little creature , and helped Hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the <unk> , never thinking of any reward but to be loved .
Long , quiet days she spent , not lonely nor idle , for her little world was <unk> with imaginary friends , and she was by nature a busy <unk> .
There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning , for Beth was a child still , and loved her <unk> as well as ever .
Not one whole or handsome one among them ; all were <unk> till Beth took them in ; for , when her sisters <unk> these <unk> , they passed to her , because Amy would have nothing old or ugly .
Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason , and set up a hospital for <unk> dolls .
No pins were ever stuck into their cotton <unk> ; no <unk> words or blows were ever given them ; no neglect ever <unk> the heart of the most <unk> : but all were fed and <unk> , nursed and caressed , with an affection which never failed .
One forlorn <unk> of _ <unk> _ had belonged to Jo ; and , having led a <unk> life , was left a wreck in the rag-bag , from which dreary <unk> it was rescued by Beth , and taken to her refuge .
Having no top to its head , she tied on a neat little cap , and , as both arms and legs were gone , she hid these <unk> by folding it in a <unk> , and devoting her best bed to this <unk> invalid .
If any one had known the care <unk> on that <unk> , I think it would have touched their hearts , even while they laughed .
She brought it bits of bouquets ; she read to it , took it out to <unk> the air , hidden under her coat ; she sung it <unk> , and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face , and whispering tenderly , &quot; I hope you &apos;ll have a good night , my poor dear . &quot;
Beth had her troubles as well as the others ; and not being an angel , but a very human little girl , she often &quot; wept a little weep , &quot; as Jo said , because she couldn &apos;t take music lessons and have a fine piano .
She loved music so dearly , tried so hard to learn , and practised away so patiently at the <unk> old instrument , that it did seem as if some one ( not to hint Aunt March ) ought to help her .
Nobody did , however , and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys , that wouldn &apos;t keep in tune , when she was all alone .
She sang like a little lark about her work , never was too tired to play for Marmee and the girls , and day after day said hopefully to herself , &quot; I know I &apos;ll get my music some time , if I &apos;m good . &quot;
There are many <unk> in the world , shy and quiet , sitting in corners till needed , and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops <unk> , and the sweet , sunshiny presence <unk> , leaving silence and shadow behind .
If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was , she would have answered at once , &quot; My nose . &quot;
When she was a baby , Jo had <unk> dropped her into the <unk> , and Amy insisted that the fall had <unk> her nose forever .
It was not big , nor red , like poor &quot; <unk> &apos;s &quot; ; it was only rather flat , and all the <unk> in the world could not give it an aristocratic point .
No one minded it but herself , and it was doing its best to grow , but Amy felt deeply the want of a <unk> nose , and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself .
&quot; Little Raphael , &quot; as her sisters called her , had a decided talent for drawing , and was never so happy as when copying flowers , <unk> fairies , or <unk> stories with queer <unk> of art .
Her teachers complained that , instead of doing her <unk> , she covered her slate with <unk> ; the <unk> pages of her <unk> were used to copy maps on ; and <unk> of the most ludicrous description came <unk> out of all her books at <unk> moments .
She got through her lessons as well as she could , and managed to escape <unk> by being a model of deportment .
She was a great favorite with her <unk> , being <unk> , and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort .
Her little airs and graces were much admired , so were her accomplishments ; for beside her drawing , she could play twelve <unk> , <unk> , and read French without <unk> more than two <unk> of the words .
She had a plaintive way of saying , &quot; When papa was rich we did <unk> , &quot; which was very touching ; and her long words were considered &quot; perfectly elegant &quot; by the girls .
Amy was in a fair way to be spoilt ; for every one petted her , and her small vanities and <unk> were growing nicely .
One thing , however , rather quenched the vanities ; she had to wear her cousin &apos;s clothes .
Now <unk> &apos;s mamma hadn &apos;t a particle of taste , and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet , <unk> gowns , and fussy <unk> that did not fit .
Everything was good , well made , and little worn ; but Amy &apos;s artistic eyes were much afflicted , especially this winter , when her school dress was a dull purple , with yellow <unk> , and no trimming .
&quot; My only comfort , &quot; she said to Meg , with tears in her eyes , &quot; is , that mother don &apos;t take <unk> in my dresses whenever I &apos;m naughty , as <unk> <unk> &apos; mother does .
My dear , it &apos;s really dreadful ; for sometimes she is so bad , her frock is up to her knees , and she can &apos;t come to school .
When I think of this _ <unk> _ , I feel that I can bear even my flat nose and purple gown , with yellow <unk> on it . &quot;
Meg was Amy &apos;s confidant and <unk> , and , by some strange attraction of <unk> , Jo was gentle Beth &apos;s .
To Jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts ; and over her big , harum-scarum sister , Beth unconsciously <unk> more influence than any one in the family .
The two older girls were a great deal to one another , but each took one of the younger into her keeping , and watched over her in her own way ; &quot; playing mother &quot; they called it , and put their sisters in the places of <unk> dolls , with the maternal instinct of little women .
&quot; Has anybody got anything to tell ?
It &apos;s been such a dismal day I &apos;m really dying for some amusement , &quot; said Meg , as they sat sewing together that evening .
&quot; I had a queer time with aunt to-day , and , as I got the best of it , I &apos;ll tell you about it , &quot; began Jo , who dearly loved to tell stories .
&quot; I was reading that everlasting Belsham , and <unk> away as I always do , for aunt soon drops off , and then I take out some nice book , and read like <unk> till she wakes up .
I actually made myself sleepy ; and , before she began to nod , I gave such a <unk> that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> that everlasting Belsham &#93; &quot; &apos; I wish I could , and be done with it , &apos; said I , trying not to be <unk> .
&quot; Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins , and told me to sit and think them over while she just &apos; lost &apos; herself for a moment .
She never finds herself very soon ; so the minute her cap began to <unk> , like a <unk> <unk> , I <unk> the &apos; <unk> of <unk> &apos; out of my pocket , and read away , with one eye on him , and one on aunt .
I &apos;d just got to where they all tumbled into the water , when I forgot , and laughed out loud .
Aunt woke up ; and , being more good-natured after her nap , told me to read a bit , and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and <unk> Belsham .
I did my very best , and she liked it , though she only said , -- &quot; &apos; I don &apos;t understand what it &apos;s all about .
Go back and begin it , child . &apos;
&quot; <unk> I went , and made the <unk> as interesting as ever I could .
Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place , and say meekly , &apos; I &apos;m afraid it <unk> you , ma &apos;am ; sha &apos;n&apos;t I stop now ? &apos;
&quot; She caught up her knitting , which had dropped out of her hands , gave me a sharp look through her <unk> , and said , in her short way , -- &quot; &apos; <unk> the chapter , and don &apos;t be impertinent , miss . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Did she own she liked it ? &quot;
asked Meg .
&quot; Oh , bless you , no !
but she let old Belsham rest ; and , when I ran back after my gloves this afternoon , there she was , so hard at the <unk> that she didn &apos;t hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall , because of the good time coming .
What a pleasant life she might have , if she only chose .
I don &apos;t envy her much , in spite of her money , for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones , I think , &quot; added Jo .
&quot; That reminds me , &quot; said Meg , &quot; that I &apos;ve got something to tell .
It isn &apos;t funny , like Jo &apos;s story , but I thought about it a good deal as I came home .
At the Kings to-day I found everybody in a flurry , and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful , and papa had sent him away .
I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking very loud , and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed me , so I shouldn &apos;t see how red their eyes were .
I didn &apos;t ask any questions , of course ; but I felt so sorry for them , and was rather glad I hadn &apos;t any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family . &quot;
&quot; I think being disgraced in school is a great deal try _ <unk> _ than anything bad boys can do , &quot; said Amy , shaking her head , as if her experience of life had been a deep one .
&quot; Susie <unk> came to school to-day with a lovely red carnelian ring ; I wanted it dreadfully , and wished I was her with all my might .
Well , she drew a picture of Mr. Davis , with a <unk> nose and a <unk> , and the words , &apos; Young ladies , my eye is upon you ! &apos;
coming out of his mouth in a <unk> thing .
We were laughing over it , when all of a sudden his eye _ was _ on us , and he ordered Susie to bring up her slate .
She was _ <unk> _ <unk> with fright , but she went , and oh , what _ do _ you think he did ?
He took her by the ear , the ear !
just fancy how horrid ! --and led her to the <unk> <unk> , and made her stand there half an hour , holding that slate so every one could see . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : He took her by the ear !
by the ear ! &#93;
&quot; Didn &apos;t the girls laugh at the picture ? &quot;
asked Jo , who <unk> the scrape .
&quot; <unk> ?
Not one !
They sat as still as mice ; and Susie cried quarts , I know she did .
I didn &apos;t envy her then ; for I felt that <unk> of carnelian rings wouldn &apos;t have made me happy , after that .
I never , never should have got over such a <unk> mortification . &quot;
And Amy went on with her work , in the proud consciousness of virtue , and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath .
&quot; I saw something that I liked this morning , and I meant to tell it at dinner , but I forgot , &quot; said Beth , putting Jo &apos;s topsy-turvy basket in order as she talked .
&quot; When I went to get some <unk> for Hannah , Mr. Laurence was in the <unk> ; but he didn &apos;t see me , for I kept behind a <unk> , and he was busy with Mr. Cutter , the <unk> .
A poor woman came in , with a pail and a mop , and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some <unk> for a bit of fish , because she hadn &apos;t any dinner for her children , and had been disappointed of a day &apos;s work .
Mr. Cutter was in a hurry , and said &apos; No , &apos; rather crossly ; so she was going away , looking hungry and sorry , when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the <unk> end of his cane , and held it out to her .
She was so glad and surprised , she took it right in her arms , and thanked him over and over .
He told her to &apos; go along and cook it , &apos; and she hurried off , so happy !
Wasn &apos;t it good of him ?
Oh , she did look so funny , hugging the big , <unk> fish , and hoping Mr. Laurence &apos;s bed in heaven would be &apos; <unk> . &apos; &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish &#93; When they had laughed at Beth &apos;s story , they asked their mother for one ; and , after a moment &apos;s thought , she said soberly , -- &quot; As I sat cutting out blue <unk> jackets to-day , at the rooms , I felt very anxious about father , and thought how lonely and helpless we should be , if anything happened to him .
It was not a wise thing to do ; but I kept on worrying , till an old man came in , with an order for some clothes .
He sat down near me , and I began to talk to him ; for he looked poor and tired and anxious .
&quot; &apos; Have you <unk> in the army ? &apos;
I asked ; for the note he brought was not to me .
&quot; &apos; Yes , ma &apos;am .
I had four , but two were killed , one is a prisoner , and I &apos;m going to the other , who is very sick in a Washington hospital , &apos; he answered quietly .
&quot; &apos; You have done a great deal for your country , sir , &apos; I said , feeling respect now , instead of pity .
&quot; &apos; Not a mite more than I ought , ma &apos;am .
I &apos;d go myself , if I was any use ; as I ain &apos;t , I give my boys , and give &apos; em free . &apos;
&quot; He spoke so cheerfully , looked so sincere , and seemed so glad to give his all , that I was ashamed of myself .
I &apos;d given one man , and thought it too much , while he gave four , without <unk> them .
I had all my girls to comfort me at home ; and his last son was waiting , miles away , to say &apos; good by &apos; to him , perhaps !
I felt so rich , so happy , thinking of my blessings , that I made him a nice bundle , gave him some money , and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me . &quot;
&quot; Tell another story , mother , --one with a moral to it , like this .
I like to think about them afterwards , if they are real , and not too <unk> , &quot; said Jo , after a minute &apos;s silence .
Mrs. March smiled , and began at once ; for she had told stories to this little audience for many years , and knew how to please them .
&quot; Once upon a time , there were four girls , who had enough to eat and drink and wear , a good many comforts and pleasures , kind friends and parents , who loved them dearly , and yet they were not contented . &quot;
( Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another , and began to sew diligently . )
&quot; These girls were anxious to be good , and made many excellent resolutions ; but they did not keep them very well , and were constantly saying , &apos; If we only had this , &apos; or &apos; If we could only do that , &apos; quite forgetting how much they already had , and how many pleasant things they actually could do .
So they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy , and she said , &apos; When you feel discontented , think over your blessings , and be grateful . &apos; &quot;
( Here Jo looked up quickly , as if about to speak , but changed her mind , seeing that the story was not done yet . )
&quot; Being sensible girls , they decided to try her advice , and soon were surprised to see how well off they were .
One discovered that money couldn &apos;t keep shame and sorrow out of rich people &apos;s houses ; another that , though she was poor , she was a great deal happier , with her youth , health , and good spirits , than a certain <unk> , feeble old lady , who couldn &apos;t enjoy her comforts ; a third that , disagreeable as it was to help get dinner , it was harder still to have to go begging for it ; and the fourth , that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior .
So they agreed to stop complaining , to enjoy the blessings already possessed , and try to deserve them , lest they should be taken away entirely , instead of increased ; and I believe they were never disappointed , or sorry that they took the old woman &apos;s advice . &quot;
&quot; Now , Marmee , that is very <unk> of you to turn our own stories against us , and give us a sermon instead of a romance ! &quot;
cried Meg .
&quot; I like that kind of sermon .
It &apos;s the sort father used to tell us , &quot; said Beth thoughtfully , putting the needles straight on Jo &apos;s cushion .
&quot; I don &apos;t complain near as much as the others do , and I shall be more careful than ever now ; for I &apos;ve had warning from Susie &apos;s <unk> , &quot; said Amy <unk> .
&quot; We needed that lesson , and we won &apos;t forget it .
If we do , you just say to us , as old <unk> did in &apos; Uncle <unk> , &apos; &apos; <unk> <unk> yer <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> <unk> yer <unk> ! &apos; &quot;
added Jo , who could not , for the life of her , help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon , though she took it to heart as much as any of them .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; <unk> <unk> <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : Being neighborly &#93; &quot; What in the world are you going to do now , Jo ? &quot;
asked Meg , one snowy afternoon , as her sister came tramping through the hall , in rubber boots , old <unk> and hood , with a broom in one hand and a <unk> in the other .
&quot; Going out for exercise , &quot; answered Jo , with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes .
&quot; I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough !
It &apos;s cold and dull out ; and I advise you to stay , warm and dry , by the fire , as I do , &quot; said Meg , with a shiver .
&quot; Never take advice !
Can &apos;t keep still all day , and , not being a <unk> , I don &apos;t like to <unk> by the fire .
I like adventures , and I &apos;m going to find some . &quot;
Meg went back to toast her feet and read &quot; <unk> &quot; ; and Jo began to dig <unk> with great energy .
The snow was light , and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden , for Beth to walk in when the sun came out ; and the invalid dolls needed air .
Now , the garden separated the Marches &apos; house from that of Mr. Laurence .
Both stood in a <unk> of the city , which was still <unk> , with <unk> and <unk> , large gardens , and quiet <unk> .
A low hedge parted the two <unk> .
On one side was an old , brown house , looking rather bare and shabby , <unk> of the vines that in summer covered its walls , and the flowers which then surrounded it .
On the other side was a stately stone mansion , plainly <unk> every sort of comfort and luxury , from the big <unk> and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains .
<unk> it seemed a lonely , <unk> sort of house ; for no children frolicked on the lawn , no motherly face ever smiled at the windows , and few people went in and out , except the old gentleman and his grandson .
To Jo &apos;s lively fancy , this fine house seemed a kind of <unk> <unk> , full of <unk> and delights , which no one enjoyed .
She had long wanted to behold these hidden glories , and to know the &quot; Laurence boy , &quot; who looked as if he would like to be known , if he only knew how to begin .
Since the party , she had been more eager than ever , and had planned many ways of making friends with him ; but he had not been seen lately , and Jo began to think he had gone away , when she one day <unk> a brown face at an upper window , looking wistfully down into their garden , where Beth and Amy were <unk> one another .
&quot; That boy is suffering for society and fun , &quot; she said to herself .
&quot; His grandpa does not know what &apos;s good for him , and keeps him shut up all alone .
He needs a party of jolly boys to play with , or somebody young and lively .
I &apos;ve a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so ! &quot;
The idea amused Jo , who liked to do daring things , and was always <unk> Meg by her queer performances .
The plan of &quot; going over &quot; was not forgotten ; and when the snowy afternoon came , Jo resolved to try what could be done .
She saw Mr. Laurence drive off , and then <unk> out to dig her way down to the hedge , where she paused , and took a <unk> .
All quiet , <unk> down at the lower windows ; servants out of sight , and nothing human <unk> but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window .
&quot; There he is , &quot; thought Jo , &quot; poor boy !
all alone and sick this dismal day .
It &apos;s a shame !
I &apos;ll toss up a <unk> , and make him look out , and then say a kind word to him . &quot;
Up went a handful of soft snow , and the head turned at once , showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute , as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile .
Jo nodded and laughed , and flourished her broom as she called out , -- &quot; How do you do ?
Are you sick ? &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Laurie opened the window &#93; Laurie opened the window , and croaked out as <unk> as a <unk> , -- &quot; <unk> , thank you .
I &apos;ve had a bad cold , and been shut up a week . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sorry .
What do you amuse yourself with ? &quot;
&quot; Nothing ; it &apos;s as dull as <unk> up here . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you read ? &quot;
&quot; Not much ; they won &apos;t let me . &quot;
&quot; Can &apos;t somebody read to you ? &quot;
&quot; Grandpa does , sometimes ; but my books don &apos;t interest him , and I hate to ask Brooke all the time . &quot;
&quot; Have some one come and see you , then . &quot;
&quot; There isn &apos;t any one I &apos;d like to see .
Boys make such a row , and my head is weak . &quot;
&quot; Isn &apos;t there some nice girl who &apos;d read and amuse you ?
Girls are quiet , and like to play nurse . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t know any . &quot;
&quot; You know us , &quot; began Jo , then laughed , and stopped .
&quot; So I do !
Will you come , please ? &quot;
cried Laurie .
&quot; I &apos;m not quiet and nice ; but I &apos;ll come , if mother will let me .
I &apos;ll go ask her .
Shut that window , like a good boy , and wait till I come . &quot;
With that , Jo <unk> her broom and marched into the house , wondering what they would all say to her .
Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company , and flew about to get ready ; for , as Mrs. March said , he was &quot; a little gentleman , &quot; and did honor to the coming guest by <unk> his curly <unk> , putting on a fresh collar , and trying to tidy up the room , which , in spite of half a dozen servants , was anything but neat .
Presently there came a loud ring , then a decided voice , asking for &quot; Mr. Laurie , &quot; and a <unk> servant came running up to <unk> a young lady .
&quot; All right , show her up , it &apos;s Miss Jo , &quot; said Laurie , going to the door of his little parlor to meet Jo , who appeared , looking rosy and kind and quite at her ease , with a covered dish in one hand and Beth &apos;s three kittens in the other .
&quot; Here I am , bag and <unk> , &quot; she said briskly .
&quot; Mother sent her love , and was glad if I could do anything for you .
Meg wanted me to bring some of her blanc-mange ; she makes it very nicely , and Beth thought her cats would be comforting .
I knew you &apos;d laugh at them , but I couldn &apos;t refuse , she was so anxious to do something . &quot;
It so happened that Beth &apos;s funny <unk> was just the thing ; for , in laughing over the <unk> , Laurie forgot his bashfulness , and grew sociable at once .
&quot; That looks too pretty to eat , &quot; he said , smiling with pleasure , as Jo <unk> the dish , and showed the blanc-mange , surrounded by a garland of green leaves , and the scarlet flowers of Amy &apos;s pet <unk> .
&quot; It isn &apos;t anything , only they all felt kindly , and wanted to show it .
Tell the girl to put it away for your tea : it &apos;s so simple , you can eat it ; and , being soft , it will slip down without <unk> your sore throat .
What a cosy room this is ! &quot;
&quot; It might be if it was kept nice ; but the maids are lazy , and I don &apos;t know how to make them mind .
It worries me , though . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll right it up in two minutes ; for it only needs to have the hearth brushed , so , --and the things made straight on the mantel-piece so , --and the books put here , and the bottles there , and your sofa turned from the light , and the pillows <unk> up a bit .
Now , then , you &apos;re fixed . &quot;
And so he was ; for , as she laughed and talked , Jo had whisked things into place , and given quite a different air to the room .
Laurie watched her in respectful silence ; and when she beckoned him to his sofa , he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction , saying gratefully , -- &quot; How kind you are !
Yes , that &apos;s what it wanted .
Now please take the big chair , and let me do something to amuse my company . &quot;
&quot; No ; I came to amuse you .
Shall I read aloud ? &quot;
and Jo looked <unk> toward some inviting books near by .
&quot; Thank you ; I &apos;ve read all those , and if you don &apos;t mind , I &apos;d rather talk , &quot; answered Laurie .
&quot; Not a bit ; I &apos;ll talk all day if you &apos;ll only set me going .
Beth says I never know when to stop . &quot;
&quot; Is Beth the rosy one , who <unk> at home a good deal , and sometimes goes out with a little basket ? &quot;
asked Laurie , with interest .
&quot; Yes , that &apos;s Beth ; she &apos;s my girl , and a regular good one she is , too . &quot;
&quot; The pretty one is Meg , and the <unk> one is Amy , I believe ? &quot;
&quot; How did you find that out ? &quot;
Laurie colored up , but answered frankly , &quot; Why , you see , I often hear you calling to one another , and when I &apos;m alone up here , I can &apos;t help looking over at your house , you always seem to be having such good times .
I beg your pardon for being so rude , but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are ; and when the lamps are lighted , it &apos;s like looking at a picture to see the fire , and you all round the table with your mother ; her face is right opposite , and it looks so sweet behind the flowers , I can &apos;t help watching it .
I haven &apos;t got any mother , you know ; &quot; and Laurie poked the fire to hide a little <unk> of the lips that he could not control .
The solitary , hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo &apos;s warm heart .
She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head , and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child .
Laurie was sick and lonely ; and , feeling how rich she was in <unk> and happiness , she gladly tried to share it with him .
Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said , -- &quot; We &apos;ll never draw that curtain any more , and I give you leave to look as much as you like .
I just wish , though , instead of peeping , you &apos;d come over and see us .
Mother is so splendid , she &apos;d do you heaps of good , and Beth would sing to you if _ I _ begged her to , and Amy would dance ; Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage <unk> , and we &apos;d have jolly times .
Wouldn &apos;t your grandpa let you ? &quot;
&quot; I think he would , if your mother asked him .
He &apos;s very kind , though he does not look so ; and he lets me do what I like , pretty much , only he &apos;s afraid I might be a bother to strangers , &quot; began Laurie , brightening more and more .
&quot; We are not strangers , we are neighbors , and you needn &apos;t think you &apos;d be a bother .
We _ want _ to know you , and I &apos;ve been trying to do it this ever so long .
We haven &apos;t been here a great while , you know , but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you . &quot;
&quot; You see grandpa lives among his books , and doesn &apos;t mind much what happens outside .
Mr. Brooke , my tutor , doesn &apos;t stay here , you know , and I have no one to go about with me , so I just stop at home and get on as I can . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s bad .
You ought to make an effort , and go visiting everywhere you are asked ; then you &apos;ll have plenty of friends , and pleasant places to go to .
Never mind being bashful ; it won &apos;t last long if you keep going . &quot;
Laurie turned red again , but wasn &apos;t offended at being accused of bashfulness ; for there was so much good-will in Jo , it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant .
&quot; Do you like your school ? &quot;
asked the boy , changing the subject , after a little pause , during which he stared at the fire , and Jo looked about her , well pleased .
&quot; Don &apos;t go to school ; I &apos;m a business <unk> , I mean .
I go to wait on my <unk> , and a dear , cross old soul she is , too , &quot; answered Jo .
Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question ; but remembering just in time that it wasn &apos;t manners to make too many inquiries into people &apos;s affairs , he shut it again , and looked uncomfortable .
Jo liked his good breeding , and didn &apos;t mind having a laugh at Aunt March , so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady , her fat poodle , the parrot that talked <unk> , and the library where she revelled .
Laurie enjoyed that immensely ; and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to <unk> Aunt March , and , in the middle of a fine speech , how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay , the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks , and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter .
&#91; Illustration : Poll tweaked off his wig &#93; &quot; Oh !
that does me no end of good .
Tell on , please , &quot; he said , taking his face out of the <unk> , red and shining with merriment .
Much <unk> with her success , Jo did &quot; tell on , &quot; all about their plays and plans , their hopes and fears for father , and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived .
Then they got to talking about books ; and to Jo &apos;s delight , she found that Laurie loved them as well as she did , and had read even more than herself .
&quot; If you like them so much , come down and see ours .
Grandpa is out , so you needn &apos;t be afraid , &quot; said Laurie , getting up .
&quot; I &apos;m not afraid of anything , &quot; returned Jo , with a toss of the head .
&quot; I don &apos;t believe you are ! &quot;
exclaimed the boy , looking at her with much admiration , though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman , if she met him in some of his moods .
The atmosphere of the whole house being <unk> , Laurie led the way from room to room , letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy ; and so at last they came to the library , where she clapped her hands , and pranced , as she always did when especially delighted .
It was lined with books , and there were pictures and <unk> , and distracting little <unk> full of <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> chairs , and queer tables , and <unk> ; and , best of all , a great open <unk> , with quaint <unk> all round it .
&quot; What <unk> ! &quot;
sighed Jo , <unk> into the <unk> of a velvet chair , and <unk> about her with an air of intense satisfaction .
&quot; Theodore Laurence , you ought to be the happiest boy in the world , &quot; she added impressively .
&quot; A fellow can &apos;t live on books , &quot; said Laurie , shaking his head , as he perched on a table opposite .
Before he could say more , a bell rung , and Jo flew up , exclaiming with alarm , &quot; Mercy me !
it &apos;s your grandpa ! &quot;
&quot; Well , what if it is ?
You are not afraid of anything , you know , &quot; returned the boy , looking wicked .
&quot; I think I am a little bit afraid of him , but I don &apos;t know why I should be .
Marmee said I might come , and I don &apos;t think you &apos;re any the worse for it , &quot; said Jo , <unk> herself , though she kept her eyes on the door .
&quot; I &apos;m a great deal better for it , and ever so much obliged .
I &apos;m only afraid you are very tired talking to me ; it was _ so _ pleasant , I couldn &apos;t bear to stop , &quot; said Laurie gratefully .
&quot; The doctor to see you , sir , &quot; and the maid beckoned as she spoke .
&quot; Would you mind if I left you for a minute ?
I suppose I must see him , &quot; said Laurie .
&quot; Don &apos;t mind me .
I &apos;m as happy as a cricket here , &quot; answered Jo .
Laurie went away , and his guest amused herself in her own way .
She was standing before a fine <unk> of the old gentleman , when the door opened again , and , without turning , she said decidedly , &quot; I &apos;m sure now that I shouldn &apos;t be afraid of him , for he &apos;s got kind eyes , though his mouth is grim , and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own .
He isn &apos;t as handsome as _ my _ grandfather , but I like him . &quot;
&quot; Thank you , ma &apos;am , &quot; said a gruff voice behind her ; and there , to her great dismay , stood old Mr. Laurence .
Poor Jo blushed till she couldn &apos;t blush any redder , and her heart began to beat <unk> fast as she thought what she had said .
For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her ; but that was <unk> , and the girls would laugh at her : so she resolved to stay , and get out of the scrape as she could .
A second look showed her that the living eyes , under the bushy gray eyebrows , were kinder even than the painted ones ; and there was a sly twinkle in them , which lessened her fear a good deal .
The gruff voice was <unk> than ever , as the old gentleman said abruptly , after that dreadful pause , &quot; So you &apos;re not afraid of me , hey ? &quot;
&quot; Not much , sir . &quot;
&quot; And you don &apos;t think me as handsome as your grandfather ? &quot;
&quot; Not quite , sir . &quot;
&quot; And I &apos;ve got a tremendous will , have I ? &quot;
&quot; I only said I thought so . &quot;
&quot; But you like me , in spite of it ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I do , sir . &quot;
That answer pleased the old gentleman ; he gave a short laugh , shook hands with her , and , putting his finger under her chin , turned up her face , examined it gravely , and let it go , saying , with a nod , &quot; You &apos;ve got your grandfather &apos;s spirit , if you haven &apos;t his face .
He _ was _ a fine man , my dear ; but , what is better , he was a brave and an honest one , and I was proud to be his friend . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Putting his finger under her chin &#93; &quot; Thank you , sir ; &quot; and Jo was quite comfortable after that , for it suited her exactly .
&quot; What have you been doing to this boy of mine , hey ? &quot;
was the next question , sharply put .
&quot; Only trying to be neighborly , sir ; &quot; and Jo told how her visit came about .
&quot; You think he needs cheering up a bit , do you ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; he seems a little lonely , and young folks would do him good perhaps .
We are only girls , but we should be glad to help if we could , for we don &apos;t forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us , &quot; said Jo eagerly .
&quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
that was the boy &apos;s affair .
How is the poor woman ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> nicely , sir ; &quot; and off went Jo , talking very fast , as she told all about the Hummels , in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were .
&quot; Just her father &apos;s way of doing good .
I shall come and see your mother some fine day .
Tell her so .
There &apos;s the tea-bell ; we have it early , on the boy &apos;s account .
Come down , and go on being neighborly . &quot;
&quot; If you &apos;d like to have me , sir . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;t ask you , if I didn &apos;t ; &quot; and Mr. Laurence offered her his arm with old-fashioned <unk> .
&quot; What _ would _ Meg say to this ? &quot;
thought Jo , as she was marched away , while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home .
&quot; Hey !
Why , what the dickens has come to the fellow ? &quot;
said the old gentleman , as Laurie came running down stairs , and brought up with a start of surprise at the astonishing sight of Jo arm-in-arm with his <unk> grandfather .
&quot; I didn &apos;t know you &apos;d come , sir , &quot; he began , as Jo gave him a <unk> little glance .
&quot; That &apos;s evident , by the way you racket down stairs .
Come to your tea , sir , and behave like a gentleman ; &quot; and having pulled the boy &apos;s hair by way of a <unk> , Mr. Laurence walked on , while Laurie went through a <unk> of <unk> <unk> behind their backs , which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo .
The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea , but he watched the young people , who soon chatted away like old friends , and the change in his grandson did not escape him .
There was color , light , and life in the boy &apos;s face now , <unk> in his manner , and genuine merriment in his laugh .
&quot; She &apos;s right ; the lad _ is _ lonely .
I &apos;ll see what these little girls can do for him , &quot; thought Mr. Laurence , as he looked and listened .
He liked Jo , for her odd , blunt ways suited him ; and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself .
If the Laurences had been what Jo called &quot; prim and <unk> , &quot; she would not have got on at all , for such people always made her shy and awkward ; but finding them free and easy , she was so herself , and made a good impression .
When they rose she proposed to go , but Laurie said he had something more to show her , and took her away to the conservatory , which had been lighted for her benefit .
It seemed quite <unk> to Jo , as she went up and down the walks , enjoying the <unk> walls on either side , the soft light , the damp sweet air , and the wonderful vines and trees that hung above her , <unk> her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full ; then he tied them up , saying , with the happy look Jo liked to see , &quot; Please give these to your mother , and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Please give these to your mother &#93; They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing-room , but Jo &apos;s attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano , which stood open .
&quot; Do you play ? &quot;
she asked , turning to Laurie with a respectful expression .
&quot; Sometimes , &quot; he answered modestly .
&quot; Please do now .
I want to hear it , so I can tell Beth . &quot;
&quot; Won &apos;t you first ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t know how ; too stupid to learn , but I love music dearly . &quot;
So Laurie played , and Jo listened , with her nose luxuriously buried in <unk> and <unk> .
Her respect and regard for the &quot; Laurence boy &quot; increased very much , for he played remarkably well , and didn &apos;t put on any airs .
She wished Beth could hear him , but she did not say so ; only praised him till he was quite abashed , and his grandfather came to the rescue .
&quot; That will do , that will do , young lady .
Too many <unk> are not good for him .
His music isn &apos;t bad , but I hope he will do as well in more important things .
Going ?
Well , I &apos;m much obliged to you , and I hope you &apos;ll come again .
My respects to your mother .
Good-night , <unk> Jo . &quot;
He shook hands kindly , but looked as if something did not please him .
When they got into the hall , Jo asked Laurie if she had said anything amiss .
He shook his head .
&quot; No , it was me ; he doesn &apos;t like to hear me play . &quot;
&quot; Why not ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you some day .
John is going home with you , as I can &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; No need of that ; I am not a young lady , and it &apos;s only a step .
Take care of yourself , won &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; but you will come again , I hope ? &quot;
&quot; If you promise to come and see us after you are well . &quot;
&quot; I will . &quot;
&quot; Good-night , Laurie ! &quot;
&quot; Good-night , Jo , good-night ! &quot;
When all the afternoon &apos;s adventures had been told , the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body , for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge .
Mrs. March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him ; Meg longed to walk in the conservatory ; Beth sighed for the grand piano ; and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and <unk> .
&quot; Mother , why didn &apos;t Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play ? &quot;
asked Jo , who was of an inquiring <unk> .
&quot; I am not sure , but I think it was because his son , Laurie &apos;s father , married an Italian lady , a musician , which displeased the old man , who is very proud .
The lady was good and lovely and accomplished , but he did not like her , and never saw his son after he married .
They both died when Laurie was a little child , and then his grandfather took him home .
I fancy the boy , who was born in Italy , is not very strong , and the old man is afraid of losing him , which makes him so careful .
Laurie comes naturally by his love of music , for he is like his mother , and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician ; at any rate , his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like , and so he &apos; glowered , &apos; as Jo said . &quot;
&quot; Dear me , how romantic ! &quot;
exclaimed Meg .
&quot; How silly ! &quot;
said Jo .
&quot; Let him be a musician , if he wants to , and not plague his life out sending him to college , when he hates to go . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners , I suppose .
<unk> are always nice , &quot; said Meg , who was a little sentimental .
&quot; What do you know about his eyes and his manners ?
You never spoke to him , hardly , &quot; cried Jo , who was _ not _ sentimental .
&quot; I saw him at the party , and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave .
That was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent him . &quot;
&quot; He meant the blanc-mange , I suppose . &quot;
&quot; How stupid you are , child !
He meant you , of course . &quot;
&quot; Did he ? &quot;
and Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before .
&quot; I never saw such a girl !
You don &apos;t know a compliment when you get it , &quot; said Meg , with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter .
&quot; I think they are great nonsense , and I &apos;ll thank you not to be silly , and spoil my fun .
Laurie &apos;s a nice boy , and I like him , and I won &apos;t have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish .
We &apos;ll all be good to him , because he hasn &apos;t got any mother , and he _ may _ come over and see us , <unk> &apos;t he , Marmee ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , Jo , your little friend is very welcome , and I hope Meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t call myself a child , and I &apos;m not in my teens yet , &quot; observed Amy .
&quot; What do you say , Beth ? &quot;
&quot; I was thinking about our &apos; Pilgrim &apos;s Progress , &apos; &quot; answered Beth , who had not heard a word .
&quot; How we got out of the <unk> and through the <unk> <unk> by resolving to be good , and up the <unk> hill by trying ; and that maybe the house over there , full of splendid things , is going to be our <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; We have got to get by the lions , first , &quot; said Jo , as if she rather liked the prospect .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; <unk> .
BETH <unk> THE <unk> <unk> .
The big house did prove a <unk> <unk> , though it took some time for all to get in , and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions .
Old Mr. Laurence was the <unk> one ; but after he had called , said something funny or kind to each one of the girls , and talked over old times with their mother , nobody felt much afraid of him , except timid Beth .
The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich ; for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return .
But , after a while , they found that he considered them the <unk> , and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March &apos;s motherly welcome , their cheerful society , and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs .
So they soon forgot their pride , and <unk> <unk> without stopping to think which was the greater .
All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time ; for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring .
Every one liked Laurie , and he privately informed his tutor that &quot; the Marches were regularly splendid girls . &quot;
With the delightful enthusiasm of youth , they took the solitary boy into their midst , and made much of him , and he found something very charming in the innocent <unk> of these <unk> girls .
Never having known mother or sisters , he was quick to feel the <unk> they brought about him ; and their busy , lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led .
He was tired of books , and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged to make very <unk> reports ; for Laurie was always playing <unk> , and running over to the Marches .
&quot; Never mind ; let him take a holiday , and make it up afterwards , &quot; said the old gentleman .
&quot; The good lady next door says he is studying too hard , and needs young society , amusement , and exercise .
I suspect she is right , and that I &apos;ve been <unk> the fellow as if I &apos;d been his grandmother .
Let him do what he likes , as long as he is happy .
He can &apos;t get into mischief in that little <unk> over there ; and Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can . &quot;
What good times they had , to be sure !
Such plays and <unk> , such <unk> and skating <unk> , such pleasant evenings in the old parlor , and now and then such gay little parties at the great house .
Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked , and revel in bouquets ; Jo <unk> over the new library <unk> , and convulsed the old gentleman with her <unk> ; Amy copied pictures , and enjoyed beauty to her heart &apos;s content ; and Laurie played &quot; lord of the <unk> &quot; in the most delightful style .
But Beth , though <unk> for the grand piano , could not <unk> up courage to go to the &quot; <unk> of <unk> , &quot; as Meg called it .
She went once with Jo ; but the old gentleman , not being <unk> of her <unk> , stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows , and said &quot; Hey ! &quot;
so loud , that he frightened her so much her &quot; feet chattered on the floor , &quot; she told her mother ; and she ran away , declaring she would never go there any more , not even for the dear piano .
No <unk> or <unk> could overcome her fear , till , the fact coming to Mr. Laurence &apos;s ear in some mysterious way , he set about mending matters .
During one of the brief calls he made , he <unk> led the conversation to music , and talked away about great <unk> whom he had seen , fine <unk> he had heard , and told such charming <unk> that Beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner , but crept nearer and nearer , as if <unk> .
At the back of his chair she stopped , and stood listening , with her great eyes wide open , and her cheeks red with the excitement of this unusual performance .
Taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly , Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie &apos;s lessons and teachers ; and presently , as if the idea had just occurred to him , he said to Mrs. March , -- &quot; The boy <unk> his music now , and I &apos;m glad of it , for he was getting too fond of it .
But the piano <unk> for want of use .
Wouldn &apos;t some of your girls like to run over , and practise on it now and then , just to keep it in tune , you know , ma &apos;am ? &quot;
Beth took a step forward , and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from <unk> them , for this was an irresistible temptation ; and the thought of practising on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away .
Before Mrs. March could reply , Mr. Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile , -- &quot; They needn &apos;t see or speak to any one , but run in at any time ; for I &apos;m shut up in my study at the other end of the house , Laurie is out a great deal , and the servants are never near the drawing-room after nine o &apos;clock . &quot;
Here he rose , as if going , and Beth made up her mind to speak , for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired .
&quot; Please tell the young ladies what I say ; and if they don &apos;t care to come , why , never mind . &quot;
Here a little hand slipped into his , and Beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude , as she said , in her earnest yet timid way , -- &quot; O sir , they do care , very , very much ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : O sir , they do care very much &#93; &quot; Are you the musical girl ? &quot;
he asked , without any <unk> &quot; Hey ! &quot;
as he looked down at her very kindly .
&quot; I &apos;m Beth .
I love it dearly , and I &apos;ll come , if you are quite sure nobody will hear <unk> be disturbed , &quot; she added , fearing to be rude , and trembling at her own <unk> as she spoke .
&quot; Not a soul , my dear .
The house is empty half the day ; so come , and <unk> away as much as you like , and I shall be obliged to you . &quot;
&quot; How kind you are , sir ! &quot;
Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore ; but she was not frightened now , and gave the big hand a grateful squeeze , because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her .
The old gentleman softly <unk> the hair off her forehead , and , stooping down , he kissed her , saying , in a tone few people ever heard , -- &quot; I had a little girl once , with eyes like these .
God bless you , my dear !
Good day , <unk> ; &quot; and away he went , in a great hurry .
Beth had a rapture with her mother , and then rushed up to <unk> the glorious news to her family of invalids , as the girls were not at home .
How blithely she sung that evening , and how they all laughed at her , because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep .
Next day , having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house , Beth , after two or three <unk> , fairly got in at the <unk> , and made her way , as noiselessly as any <unk> , to the drawing-room , where her idol stood .
Quite by accident , of course , some pretty , easy music lay on the piano ; and , with trembling fingers , and frequent stops to listen and look about , Beth at last touched the great instrument , and <unk> forgot her fear , herself , and everything else but the <unk> delight which the music gave her , for it was like the voice of a beloved friend .
She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner ; but she had no appetite , and could only sit and smile upon every one in a general state of <unk> .
After that , the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day , and the great drawing-room was haunted by a <unk> spirit that came and went unseen .
She never knew that Mr. Laurence often opened his <unk> to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked ; she never saw Laurie <unk> guard in the hall to warn the servants away ; she never suspected that the <unk> and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit ; and when he talked to her about music at home , she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much .
So she enjoyed herself heartily , and found , what isn &apos;t always the case , that her granted wish was all she had hoped .
Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her ; at any rate , she deserved both .
&#91; Illustration : Mr. Laurence often opened his study door &#93; &quot; Mother , I &apos;m going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers .
He is so kind to me , I must thank him , and I don &apos;t know any other way .
Can I do it ? &quot;
asked Beth , a few weeks after that <unk> call of his .
&quot; Yes , dear .
It will please him very much , and be a nice way of <unk> him .
The girls will help you about them , and I will pay for the making up , &quot; replied Mrs. March , who took peculiar pleasure in <unk> Beth &apos;s <unk> , because she so seldom asked anything for herself .
After many serious <unk> with Meg and Jo , the pattern was chosen , the <unk> bought , and the slippers begun .
A <unk> of grave yet cheerful pansies , on a <unk> purple ground , was pronounced very appropriate and pretty ; and Beth worked away early and late , with occasional <unk> over hard parts .
She was a <unk> little <unk> , and they were finished before any one got tired of them .
Then she wrote a very short , simple note , and , with Laurie &apos;s help , got them <unk> on to the <unk> one morning before the old gentleman was up .
When this excitement was over , Beth waited to see what would happen .
All that day passed , and a part of the next , before any <unk> arrived , and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety friend .
On the afternoon of the second day , she went out to do an <unk> , and give poor Joanna , the invalid doll , her daily exercise .
As she came up the street , on her return , she saw three , yes , four , heads popping in and out of the parlor windows , and the moment they saw her , several hands were waved , and several joyful voices screamed , -- &quot; Here &apos;s a letter from the old gentleman !
Come quick , and read it ! &quot;
&quot; O Beth , he &apos;s sent you-- &quot; began Amy , <unk> with <unk> energy ; but she got no further , for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window .
Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense .
At the door , her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a <unk> procession , all pointing , and all saying at once , &quot; Look there !
look there ! &quot;
Beth did look , and turned pale with delight and surprise ; for there stood a little <unk> , with a letter lying on the <unk> lid , <unk> , like a <unk> , to &quot; Miss <unk> March . &quot;
&quot; For me ? &quot;
<unk> Beth , holding on to Jo , and feeling as if she should tumble down , it was such an <unk> thing altogether .
&quot; Yes ; all for you , my precious !
Isn &apos;t it splendid of him ?
Don &apos;t you think he &apos;s the dearest old man in the world ?
Here &apos;s the key in the letter .
We didn &apos;t open it , but we are dying to know what he says , &quot; cried Jo , hugging her sister , and offering the note .
&quot; You read it !
I can &apos;t , I feel so queer !
Oh , it is too lovely ! &quot;
and Beth hid her face in Jo &apos;s apron , quite upset by her present .
Jo opened the paper , and began to laugh , for the first words she saw were , -- &quot; MISS MARCH : &quot; _ Dear Madam _ , -- &quot; &quot; How nice it sounds !
I wish some one would write to me so ! &quot;
said Amy , who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant .
&quot; &apos; I have had many pairs of slippers in my life , but I never had any that suited me so well as yours , &apos; &quot; continued Jo .
&quot; &apos; Heart <unk> is my favorite flower , and these will always remind me of the gentle <unk> .
I like to pay my debts ; so I know you will allow &quot; the old gentleman &quot; to send you something which once belonged to the little <unk> he lost .
With hearty thanks and best wishes , I remain , &quot; &apos; Your grateful friend and humble servant , &quot; &apos; <unk> LAURENCE . &apos; &quot;
&quot; There , Beth , that &apos;s an honor to be proud of , I &apos;m sure !
Laurie told me how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died , and how he kept all her little things carefully .
Just think , he &apos;s given you her piano .
That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music , &quot; said Jo , trying to soothe Beth , who trembled , and looked more excited than she had ever been before .
&quot; See the <unk> <unk> to hold <unk> , and the nice green silk , <unk> up , with a gold rose in the middle , and the pretty rack and stool , all complete , &quot; added Meg , opening the instrument and displaying its <unk> .
&quot; &apos; Your humble servant , <unk> Laurence &apos; ; only think of his writing that to you .
I &apos;ll tell the girls .
They &apos;ll think it &apos;s splendid , &quot; said Amy , much impressed by the note .
&quot; Try it , honey .
Let &apos;s hear the sound of the <unk> , &quot; said Hannah , who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows .
So Beth tried it ; and every one pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard .
It had evidently been newly <unk> and put in <unk> order ; but , perfect as it was , I think the real charm of it lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it , as Beth <unk> touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright <unk> .
&quot; You &apos;ll have to go and thank him , &quot; said Jo , by way of a joke ; for the idea of the child &apos;s really going never entered her head .
&quot; Yes , I mean to .
I guess I &apos;ll go now , before I get frightened thinking about it . &quot;
And , to the utter amazement of the assembled family , Beth walked <unk> down the garden , through the hedge , and in at the Laurences &apos; door .
&quot; Well , I wish I may die if it ain &apos;t the <unk> thing I ever see !
The <unk> has turned her head !
She &apos;d never have gone in her right mind , &quot; cried Hannah , staring after her , while the girls were <unk> quite <unk> by the miracle .
They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did afterward .
If you will believe me , she went and knocked at the <unk> before she gave herself time to think ; and when a gruff voice called out , &quot; Come in ! &quot;
she did go in , right up to Mr. Laurence , who looked quite taken <unk> , and held out her hand , saying , with only a small <unk> in her voice , &quot; I came to thank you , sir , <unk> &quot; But she didn &apos;t finish ; for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech , and , only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved , she put both arms round his neck , and kissed him .
&#91; Illustration : She put both arms around his neck and kissed him &#93; If the roof of the house had suddenly <unk> off , the old gentleman wouldn &apos;t have been more astonished ; but he liked it , <unk> , dear , yes , he liked it amazingly ! --and was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his <unk> vanished ; and he just set her on his knee , and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one , feeling as if he had got his own little <unk> back again .
Beth ceased to fear him from that moment , and sat there talking to him as <unk> as if she had known him all her life ; for love <unk> out fear , and gratitude can conquer pride .
When she went home , he walked with her to her own gate , shook hands cordially , and touched his hat as he marched back again , looking very stately and erect , like a handsome , <unk> old gentleman , as he was .
When the girls saw that performance , Jo began to dance a jig , by way of <unk> her satisfaction ; Amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise ; and Meg exclaimed , with uplifted hands , &quot; Well , I do believe the world is coming to an end ! &quot;
<unk> .
AMY &apos;S VALLEY OF <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : The Cyclops &#93; &quot; That boy is a perfect Cyclops , isn &apos;t he ? &quot;
said Amy , one day , as Laurie <unk> by on <unk> , with a flourish of his <unk> as he passed .
&quot; How dare you say so , when he &apos;s got both his eyes ?
and very handsome ones they are , too , &quot; cried Jo , who resented any <unk> remarks about her friend .
&quot; I didn &apos;t say anything about his eyes , and I don &apos;t see why you need fire up when I admire his riding . &quot;
&quot; Oh , my goodness !
that little goose means a <unk> , and she called him a Cyclops , &quot; exclaimed Jo , with a burst of laughter .
&quot; You needn &apos;t be so rude ; it &apos;s only a &apos; <unk> of <unk> , &apos; as Mr. Davis says , &quot; retorted Amy , finishing Jo with her Latin .
&quot; I just wish I had a little of the money Laurie <unk> on that horse , &quot; she added , as if to herself , yet hoping her sisters would hear .
&quot; Why ? &quot;
asked Meg kindly , for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy &apos;s second blunder .
&quot; I need it so much ; I &apos;m dreadfully in debt , and it won &apos;t be my turn to have the <unk> for a month . &quot;
&quot; In debt , Amy ?
What do you mean ? &quot;
and Meg looked sober .
&quot; Why , I owe at least a dozen pickled limes , and I can &apos;t pay them , you know , till I have money , for Marmee forbade my having anything <unk> at the shop . &quot;
&quot; Tell me all about it .
Are limes the fashion now ?
It used to be <unk> bits of rubber to make <unk> ; &quot; and Meg tried to keep her countenance , Amy looked so grave and important .
&quot; Why , you see , the girls are always buying them , and unless you want to be thought mean , you must do it , too .
It &apos;s nothing but limes now , for every one is <unk> them in their <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> them off for pencils , <unk> , paper dolls , or something else , at recess .
If one girl likes another , she gives her a <unk> ; if she &apos;s mad with her , she <unk> one before her face , and don &apos;t offer even a <unk> .
They treat by turns ; and I &apos;ve had ever so many , but haven &apos;t returned them ; and I ought , for they are debts of honor , you know . &quot;
&quot; How much will pay them off , and restore your credit ? &quot;
asked Meg , taking out her purse .
&quot; A <unk> would more than do it , and leave a few cents over for a treat for you .
Don &apos;t you like limes ? &quot;
&quot; Not much ; you may have my share .
Here &apos;s the money .
Make it last as long as you can , for it isn &apos;t very plenty , you know . &quot;
&quot; Oh , thank you !
It must be so nice to have <unk> !
I &apos;ll have a grand feast , for I haven &apos;t tasted a <unk> this week .
I felt delicate about taking any , as I couldn &apos;t return them , and I &apos;m actually suffering for one . &quot;
Next day Amy was rather late at school ; but could not resist the temptation of displaying , with pardonable pride , a <unk> <unk> parcel , before she <unk> it to the <unk> <unk> of her desk .
During the next few minutes the <unk> that Amy March had got twenty-four delicious limes ( she ate one on the way ) , and was going to treat , <unk> through her &quot; set , &quot; and the attentions of her friends became quite <unk> .
<unk> Brown invited her to her next party on the spot ; Mary <unk> insisted on lending her her watch till recess ; and Jenny Snow , a <unk> young lady , who had basely <unk> Amy upon her <unk> state , promptly buried the <unk> , and offered to <unk> answers to certain <unk> <unk> .
But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow &apos;s cutting remarks about &quot; some persons whose <unk> were not too flat to smell other people &apos;s limes , and <unk> people , who were not too proud to ask for them ; &quot; and she <unk> crushed &quot; that Snow girl &apos;s &quot; hopes by the <unk> telegram , &quot; You needn &apos;t be so polite all of a sudden , for you won &apos;t get any . &quot;
A <unk> <unk> happened to visit the school that morning , and Amy &apos;s beautifully drawn maps received praise , which honor to her <unk> <unk> in the soul of Miss Snow , and caused Miss March to <unk> the airs of a studious young peacock .
But , alas , alas !
pride goes before a fall , and the <unk> Snow turned the tables with <unk> success .
No sooner had the guest paid the usual <unk> compliments , and bowed himself out , than Jenny , under pretence of asking an important question , informed Mr. Davis , the teacher , that Amy March had pickled limes in her desk .
Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a <unk> article , and solemnly <unk> to <unk> ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law .
This <unk> man had succeeded in <unk> <unk> after a long and stormy war , had made a <unk> of the <unk> novels and newspapers , had suppressed a private post-office , had forbidden <unk> of the face , <unk> , and <unk> , and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order .
Boys are trying enough to human patience , goodness knows !
but girls are infinitely more so , especially to nervous gentlemen , with <unk> tempers , and no more talent for teaching than Dr. <unk> .
Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek , Latin , <unk> , and <unk> of all sorts , so he was called a fine teacher ; and manners , <unk> , feelings , and <unk> were not considered of any particular <unk> .
It was a most unfortunate moment for <unk> Amy , and Jenny knew it .
Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning ; there was an east wind , which always affected his <unk> ; and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved : therefore , to use the expressive , if not elegant , language of a <unk> , &quot; he was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear . &quot;
The word &quot; limes &quot; was like fire to <unk> ; his yellow face flushed , and he <unk> on his desk with an energy which made Jenny <unk> to her seat with unusual rapidity .
&quot; Young ladies , attention , if you please ! &quot;
At the stern order the <unk> ceased , and fifty pairs of blue , black , gray , and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance .
&quot; Miss March , come to the desk . &quot;
Amy rose to comply with <unk> <unk> , but a secret fear <unk> her , for the limes weighed upon her conscience .
&quot; Bring with you the limes you have in your desk , &quot; was the unexpected <unk> which arrested her before she got out of her seat .
&quot; Don &apos;t take all , &quot; whispered her neighbor , a young lady of great presence of mind .
Amy hastily shook out half a dozen , and laid the rest down before Mr. Davis , feeling that any man possessing a human heart would <unk> when that delicious <unk> met his nose .
Unfortunately , Mr. Davis particularly <unk> the <unk> of the fashionable <unk> , and disgust added to his wrath .
&quot; Is that all ? &quot;
&quot; Not quite , &quot; stammered Amy .
&quot; Bring the rest immediately . &quot;
With a despairing glance at her set , she obeyed .
&quot; You are sure there are no more ? &quot;
&quot; I never lie , sir . &quot;
&quot; So I see .
Now take these <unk> things two by two , and throw them out of the window . &quot;
There was a <unk> sigh , which created quite a little <unk> , as the last hope fled , and the treat was <unk> from their longing lips .
<unk> with shame and anger , Amy went to and fro six dreadful times ; and as each <unk> <unk> oh !
so plump and <unk> from her <unk> hands , a shout from the street <unk> the anguish of the girls , for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little Irish children , who were their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> was too much ; all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the <unk> Davis , and one passionate <unk> burst into tears .
As Amy returned from her last trip , Mr. Davis gave a <unk> &quot; Hem ! &quot;
and said , in his most impressive manner , -- &quot; Young ladies , you remember what I said to you a week ago .
I am sorry this has happened , but I never allow my rules to be <unk> , and I _ never _ break my word .
Miss March , hold out your hand . &quot;
Amy started , and put both hands behind her , turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter .
She was rather a favorite with &quot; old Davis , &quot; as , of course , he was called , and it &apos;s my private belief that he _ would _ have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a <unk> .
That <unk> , faint as it was , irritated the irascible gentleman , and sealed the culprit &apos;s fate .
&quot; Your hand , Miss March ! &quot;
was the only answer her mute appeal received ; and , too proud to cry or <unk> , Amy set her teeth , threw back her head <unk> , and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm .
They were neither many nor heavy , but that made no difference to her .
For the first time in her life she had been struck ; and the disgrace , in her eyes , was as deep as if he had knocked her down .
&#91; Illustration : Amy bore without flinching several tingling blows &#93; &quot; You will now stand on the <unk> till recess , &quot; said Mr. Davis , resolved to do the thing thoroughly , since he had begun .
That was dreadful .
It would have been bad enough to go to her seat , and see the <unk> faces of her friends , or the satisfied ones of her few enemies ; but to face the whole school , with that shame fresh upon her , seemed impossible , and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood , and break her heart with crying .
A bitter sense of wrong , and the thought of Jenny Snow , helped her to bear it ; and , taking the <unk> place , she fixed her eyes on the <unk> above what now seemed a sea of faces , and stood there , so motionless and white that the girls found it very hard to study , with that pathetic figure before them .
During the fifteen minutes that followed , the proud and <unk> little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot .
To others it might seem a ludicrous or <unk> affair , but to her it was a hard experience ; for during the twelve years of her life she had been <unk> by love alone , and a blow of that sort had never touched her before .
The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the <unk> of the thought , -- &quot; I shall have to tell at home , and they will be so disappointed in me ! &quot;
The fifteen minutes seemed an hour ; but they came to an end at last , and the word &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
had never seemed so welcome to her before .
&quot; You can go , Miss March , &quot; said Mr. Davis , looking , as he felt , uncomfortable .
He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him , as she went , without a word to any one , straight into the <unk> , snatched her things , and left the place &quot; forever , &quot; as she passionately declared to herself .
She was in a sad state when she got home ; and when the older girls arrived , some time later , an indignation meeting was held at once .
Mrs. March did not say much , but looked disturbed , and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner .
Meg <unk> the insulted hand with <unk> and tears ; Beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for <unk> like this ; Jo <unk> proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay ; and Hannah shook her fist at the &quot; villain , &quot; and <unk> potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her <unk> .
No notice was taken of Amy &apos;s flight , except by her <unk> ; but the <unk> <unk> discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in the afternoon , also unusually nervous .
Just before school closed , Jo appeared , wearing a grim expression , as she stalked up to the desk , and delivered a letter from her mother ; then collected Amy &apos;s property , and departed , carefully <unk> the mud from her boots on the <unk> , as if she shook the dust of the place off her feet .
&quot; Yes , you can have a vacation from school , but I want you to study a little every day , with Beth , &quot; said Mrs. March , that evening .
&quot; I don &apos;t approve of <unk> punishment , especially for girls .
I <unk> Mr. Davis &apos;s manner of teaching , and don &apos;t think the girls you associate with are doing you any good , so I shall ask your father &apos;s advice before I send you anywhere else . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s good !
I wish all the girls would leave , and spoil his old school .
It &apos;s perfectly <unk> to think of those lovely limes , &quot; sighed Amy , with the air of a martyr .
&quot; I am not sorry you lost them , for you broke the rules , and deserved some punishment for <unk> , &quot; was the severe reply , which rather disappointed the young lady , who expected nothing but sympathy .
&quot; Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school ? &quot;
cried Amy .
&quot; I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault , &quot; replied her mother ; &quot; but I &apos;m not sure that it won &apos;t do you more good than a <unk> method .
You are getting to be rather <unk> , my dear , and it is quite time you set about <unk> it .
You have a good many little gifts and virtues , but there is no need of <unk> them , for <unk> <unk> the finest genius .
There is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be <unk> long ; even if it is , the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one , and the great charm of all power is <unk> . &quot;
&quot; So it is ! &quot;
cried Laurie , who was playing <unk> in a corner with Jo .
&quot; I knew a girl , once , who had a really remarkable talent for music , and she didn &apos;t know it ; never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone , and wouldn &apos;t have believed it if any one had told her . &quot;
&quot; I wish I &apos;d known that nice girl ; maybe she would have helped me , I &apos;m so stupid , &quot; said Beth , who stood beside him , listening eagerly .
&quot; You do know her , and she helps you better than any one else could , &quot; answered Laurie , looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes , that Beth suddenly turned very red , and hid her face in the <unk> , quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery .
&#91; Illustration : You do know her &#93; Jo let Laurie win the game , to pay for that praise of her Beth , who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment .
So Laurie did his best , and sung delightfully , being in a particularly lively humor , for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character .
When he was gone , Amy , who had been pensive all the evening , said suddenly , as if busy over some new idea , -- &quot; Is Laurie an accomplished boy ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; he has had an excellent education , and has much talent ; he will make a fine man , if not spoilt by petting , &quot; replied her mother .
&quot; And he isn &apos;t <unk> , is he ? &quot;
asked Amy .
&quot; Not in the least ; that is why he is so charming , and we all like him so much . &quot;
&quot; I see ; it &apos;s nice to have accomplishments , and be elegant ; but not to show off , or get <unk> up , &quot; said Amy thoughtfully .
&quot; These things are always seen and felt in a person &apos;s manner and conversation , if modestly used ; but it is not necessary to display them , &quot; said Mrs. March .
&quot; Any more than it &apos;s proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once , that folks may know you &apos;ve got them , &quot; added Jo ; and the lecture ended in a laugh .
&#91; Illustration : Girls , where are you going ? &#93;
<unk> .
JO <unk> <unk> .
&quot; Girls , where are you going ? &quot;
asked Amy , coming into their room one Saturday afternoon , and finding them getting ready to go out , with an air of <unk> which excited her curiosity .
&quot; Never mind ; little girls shouldn &apos;t ask questions , &quot; returned Jo sharply .
Now if there _ is _ anything <unk> to our feelings , when we are young , it is to be told that ; and to be <unk> to &quot; run away , dear , &quot; is still more trying to us .
Amy <unk> up at this insult , and determined to find out the secret , if she teased for an hour .
Turning to Meg , who never refused her anything very long , she said <unk> , &quot; Do tell me !
I should think you might let me go , too ; for Beth is fussing over her piano , and I haven &apos;t got anything to do , and am _ so _ lonely . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t , dear , because you aren &apos;t invited , &quot; began Meg ; but Jo broke in impatiently , &quot; Now , Meg , be quiet , or you will spoil it all .
You can &apos;t go , Amy ; so don &apos;t be a baby , and <unk> about it . &quot;
&quot; You are going somewhere with Laurie , I know you are ; you were whispering and laughing together , on the sofa , last night , and you stopped when I came in .
Aren &apos;t you going with him ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , we are ; now do be still , and stop <unk> . &quot;
Amy held her tongue , but used her eyes , and saw Meg slip a fan into her pocket .
&quot; I know !
I know !
you &apos;re going to the theatre to see the &apos; Seven <unk> ! &apos; &quot;
she cried ; adding <unk> , &quot; and I _ shall _ go , for mother said I might see it ; and I &apos;ve got my <unk> , and it was mean not to tell me in time . &quot;
&quot; Just listen to me a minute , and be a good child , &quot; said Meg soothingly .
&quot; Mother doesn &apos;t wish you to go this week , because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece .
Next week you can go with Beth and Hannah , and have a nice time . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t like that half as well as going with you and Laurie .
Please let me ; I &apos;ve been sick with this cold so long , and shut up , I &apos;m dying for some fun .
Do , Meg !
I &apos;ll be ever so good , &quot; pleaded Amy , looking as pathetic as she could .
&quot; Suppose we take her .
I don &apos;t believe mother would mind , if we bundle her up well , &quot; began Meg .
&quot; If _ she _ goes _ I _ sha &apos;n&apos;t ; and if I don &apos;t , Laurie won &apos;t like it ; and it will be very rude , after he invited only us , to go and drag in Amy .
I should think she &apos;d hate to <unk> herself where she isn &apos;t wanted , &quot; said Jo crossly , for she disliked the trouble of <unk> a fidgety child , when she wanted to enjoy herself .
Her tone and manner <unk> Amy , who began to put her boots on , saying , in her most <unk> way , &quot; I _ shall _ go ; Meg says I may ; and if I pay for myself , Laurie hasn &apos;t anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; You can &apos;t sit with us , for our seats are <unk> , and you mustn &apos;t sit alone ; so Laurie will give you his place , and that will spoil our pleasure ; or he &apos;ll get another seat for you , and that isn &apos;t proper , when you weren &apos;t asked .
You sha &apos;n&apos;t stir a step ; so you may just stay where you are , &quot; scolded Jo , <unk> than ever , having just pricked her finger in her hurry .
Sitting on the floor , with one <unk> on , Amy began to cry , and Meg to reason with her , when Laurie called from below , and the two girls hurried down , leaving their sister wailing ; for now and then she forgot her grown-up ways , and acted like a spoilt child .
Just as the party was setting out , Amy called over the banisters , in a threatening tone , &quot; You &apos;ll be sorry for this , Jo March ; see if you ain &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
returned Jo , slamming the door .
They had a charming time , for &quot; The Seven <unk> of the <unk> <unk> &quot; were as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish .
But , in spite of the comical red <unk> , <unk> elves , and gorgeous <unk> and princesses , Jo &apos;s pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it ; the fairy queen &apos;s yellow curls reminded her of Amy ; and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her &quot; sorry for it . &quot;
She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives , for both had quick tempers , and were apt to be violent when fairly roused .
Amy teased Jo , and Jo irritated Amy , and <unk> <unk> occurred , of which both were much ashamed afterward .
<unk> the oldest , Jo had the least <unk> , and had hard times trying to <unk> the <unk> spirit which was continually getting her into trouble ; her anger never lasted long , and , having humbly confessed her fault , she sincerely <unk> , and tried to do better .
Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a <unk> , because she was such an angel afterward .
Poor Jo tried desperately to be good , but her bosom enemy was always ready to <unk> up and <unk> her ; and it took years of patient effort to <unk> it .
When they got home , they found Amy reading in the parlor .
She assumed an injured air as they came in ; never lifted her eyes from her book , or asked a single question .
Perhaps curiosity might have conquered <unk> , if Beth had not been there to inquire , and receive a <unk> description of the play .
On going up to put away her best hat , Jo &apos;s first look was toward the bureau ; for , in their last quarrel , Amy had soothed her feelings by turning Jo &apos;s top drawer upside down on the floor .
Everything was in its place , however ; and after a hasty glance into her various <unk> , bags , and boxes , Jo decided that Amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs .
There Jo was mistaken ; for next day she made a discovery which produced a <unk> .
Meg , Beth , and Amy were sitting together , late in the afternoon , when Jo burst into the room , looking excited , and demanding breathlessly , &quot; Has any one taken my book ? &quot;
Meg and Beth said &quot; No , &quot; at once , and looked surprised ; Amy poked the fire , and said nothing .
Jo saw her color rise , and was down upon her in a minute .
&quot; Amy , you &apos;ve got it ? &quot;
&quot; No , I haven &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; You know where it is , then ? &quot;
&quot; No , I don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s a fib ! &quot;
cried Jo , taking her by the shoulders , and looking fierce enough to frighten a much <unk> child than Amy .
&quot; It isn &apos;t .
I haven &apos;t got it , don &apos;t know where it is now , and don &apos;t care . &quot;
&quot; You know something about it , and you &apos;d better tell at once , or I &apos;ll make you , &quot; and Jo gave her a slight shake .
&quot; <unk> as much as you like , you &apos;ll never see your silly old book again , &quot; cried Amy , getting excited in her turn .
&quot; Why not ? &quot;
&quot; I burnt it up . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : I burnt it up &#93; &quot; What !
my little book I was so fond of , and worked over , and meant to finish before father got home ?
Have you really burnt it ? &quot;
said Jo , turning very pale , while her eyes kindled and her hands <unk> Amy nervously .
&quot; Yes , I did !
I told you I &apos;d make you pay for being so cross yesterday , and I have , <unk> &quot; Amy got no <unk> , for Jo &apos;s hot temper <unk> her , and she shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head ; crying , in a passion of grief and anger , -- &quot; You wicked , wicked girl !
I never can write it again , and I &apos;ll never forgive you as long as I live . &quot;
Meg flew to rescue Amy , and Beth to <unk> Jo , but Jo was quite beside herself ; and , with a parting box on her sister &apos;s ear , she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret , and finished her fight alone .
The storm cleared up below , for Mrs. March came home , and , having heard the story , soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister .
Jo &apos;s book was the pride of her heart , and was regarded by her family as a literary <unk> of great promise .
It was only half a dozen little fairy tales , but Jo had worked over them patiently , putting her whole heart into her work , hoping to make something good enough to print .
She had just copied them with great care , and had <unk> the old manuscript , so that Amy &apos;s <unk> had <unk> the loving work of several years .
It seemed a small loss to others , but to Jo it was a dreadful <unk> , and she felt that it never could be made up to her .
Beth <unk> as for a departed kitten , and Meg refused to defend her pet ; Mrs. March looked grave and grieved , and Amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them .
When the tea-bell rung , Jo appeared , looking so grim and <unk> that it took all Amy &apos;s courage to say meekly , -- &quot; Please forgive me , Jo ; I &apos;m very , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; I never shall forgive you , &quot; was Jo &apos;s stern answer ; and , from that moment , she <unk> Amy entirely .
No one spoke of the great trouble , --not even Mrs. March , --for all had learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted ; and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident , or her own generous nature , softened Jo &apos;s <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
It was not a happy evening ; for , though they sewed as usual , while their mother read aloud from <unk> , Scott , or <unk> , something was wanting , and the sweet <unk> was disturbed .
They felt this most when <unk> came ; for Beth could only play , Jo stood dumb as a stone , and Amy broke down , so Meg and mother sung alone .
But , in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks , the <unk> voices did not seem to <unk> as well as usual , and all felt out of tune .
As Jo received her good-night kiss , Mrs. March whispered gently , -- &quot; My dear , don &apos;t let the sun go down upon your anger ; forgive each other , help each other , and begin again to-morrow . &quot;
Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom , and cry her grief and anger all away ; but tears were an <unk> <unk> , and she felt so deeply injured that she really _ couldn &apos;t _ quite forgive yet .
So she <unk> hard , shook her head , and said , gruffly because Amy was listening , -- &quot; It was an abominable thing , and she don &apos;t deserve to be forgiven . &quot;
With that she marched off to bed , and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night .
Amy was much offended that her <unk> of peace had been <unk> , and began to wish she had not <unk> herself , to feel more injured than ever , and to <unk> herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating .
Jo still looked like a <unk> , and nothing went well all day .
It was bitter cold in the morning ; she dropped her precious <unk> in the <unk> , Aunt March had an attack of fidgets , Meg was pensive , Beth _ would _ look grieved and wistful when she got home , and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good , and yet wouldn &apos;t try , when other people set them a virtuous example .
&quot; Everybody is so <unk> , I &apos;ll ask Laurie to go skating .
He is always kind and jolly , and will put me to rights , I know , &quot; said Jo to herself , and off she went .
Amy heard the <unk> of skates , and looked out with an impatient exclamation , -- &quot; There !
she promised I should go next time , for this is the last ice we shall have .
But it &apos;s no use to ask such a <unk> to take me . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t say that ; you _ were _ very naughty , and it _ is _ hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book ; but I think she might do it now , and I guess she will , if you try her at the right minute , &quot; said Meg .
&quot; Go after them ; don &apos;t say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie , then take a quiet minute , and just kiss her , or do some kind thing , and I &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be friends again , with all her heart . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll try , &quot; said Amy , for the advice suited her ; and , after a flurry to get ready , she ran after the friends , who were just <unk> over the hill .
It was not far to the river , but both were ready before Amy reached them .
Jo saw her coming , and turned her back ; Laurie did not see , for he was carefully skating along the shore , sounding the ice , for a warm spell had <unk> the cold <unk> .
&quot; I &apos;ll go on to the first bend , and see if it &apos;s all right , before we begin to race , &quot; Amy heard him say , as he shot away , looking like a young <unk> , in his <unk> coat and cap .
Jo heard Amy <unk> after her run , <unk> her feet and blowing her fingers , as she tried to put her skates on ; but Jo never turned , and went slowly <unk> down the river , taking a bitter , unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sister &apos;s troubles .
She had cherished her anger till it grew strong , and took possession of her , as evil thoughts and feelings always do , unless cast out at once .
As Laurie turned the bend , he <unk> back , -- &quot; Keep near the shore ; it isn &apos;t safe in the middle . &quot;
Jo heard , but Amy was just struggling to her feet , and did not catch a word .
Jo glanced over her shoulder , and the little <unk> she was <unk> said in her ear , -- &quot; No matter whether she heard or not , let her take care of herself . &quot;
Laurie had vanished round the bend ; Jo was just at the turn , and Amy , far behind , striking out toward the <unk> ice in the middle of the river .
For a minute Jo stood still , with a strange feeling at her heart ; then she resolved to go on , but something held and turned her round , just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down , with the sudden crash of <unk> ice , the splash of water , and a cry that made Jo &apos;s heart stand still with fear .
She tried to call Laurie , but her voice was gone ; she tried to rush forward , but her feet seemed to have no strength in them ; and , for a second , she could only stand motionless , staring , with a <unk> face , at the little blue hood above the black water .
Something rushed <unk> by her , and Laurie &apos;s voice cried out , -- &quot; Bring a <unk> ; quick , quick ! &quot;
How she did it , she never knew ; but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed , blindly <unk> Laurie , who was quite <unk> , and , lying flat , held Amy up by his arm and hockey till Jo dragged a <unk> from the fence , and together they got the child out , more frightened than hurt .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> Amy up by his arms and hockey &#93; &quot; Now then , we must walk her home as fast as we can ; pile our things on her , while I get off these confounded skates , &quot; cried Laurie , <unk> his coat round Amy , and <unk> away at the <unk> , which never seemed so <unk> before .
<unk> , <unk> , and crying , they got Amy home ; and , after an exciting time of it , she fell asleep , rolled in <unk> , before a hot fire .
During the bustle Jo had <unk> spoken ; but <unk> about , looking pale and wild , with her things half off , her dress torn , and her hands cut and <unk> by ice and <unk> , and refractory <unk> .
When Amy was comfortably asleep , the house quiet , and Mrs. March sitting by the bed , she called Jo to her , and began to bind up the hurt hands .
&quot; Are you sure she is safe ? &quot;
whispered Jo , looking <unk> at the golden head , which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the <unk> ice .
&quot; Quite safe , dear ; she is not hurt , and won &apos;t even take cold , I think , you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly , &quot; replied her mother cheerfully .
&quot; Laurie did it all ; I only let her go .
Mother , if she _ should _ die , it would be my fault &quot; ; and Jo dropped down beside the bed , in a passion of penitent tears , telling all that had happened , bitterly <unk> her <unk> of heart , and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her .
&quot; It &apos;s my dreadful temper !
I try to cure it ; I think I have , and then it breaks out worse than ever .
O mother , what shall I do ?
what shall I do ? &quot;
cried poor Jo , in despair .
&quot; <unk> and pray , dear ; never get tired of trying ; and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault , &quot; said Mrs. March , drawing the <unk> head to her shoulder , and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo cried harder than ever .
&quot; You don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t guess how bad it is !
It seems as if I could do anything when I &apos;m in a passion ; I get so <unk> , I could hurt any one , and enjoy it .
I &apos;m afraid I _ shall _ do something dreadful some day , and spoil my life , and make everybody hate me .
O mother , help me , do help me ! &quot;
&quot; I will , my child , I will .
Don &apos;t cry so bitterly , but remember this day , and resolve , with all your soul , that you will never know another like it .
Jo , dear , we all have our temptations , some far greater than yours , and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them .
You think your temper is the worst in the world ; but mine used to be just like it . &quot;
&quot; Yours , mother ?
Why , you are never angry ! &quot;
and , for the moment , Jo forgot remorse in surprise .
&quot; I &apos;ve been trying to cure it for forty years , and have only succeeded in <unk> it .
I am angry nearly every day of my life , Jo ; but I have learned not to show it ; and I still hope to learn not to feel it , though it may take me another forty years to do so . &quot;
The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture , the <unk> <unk> .
She felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her ; the knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers , and tried to mend it , made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it ; though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray , to a girl of fifteen .
&quot; Mother , are you angry when you fold your lips tight together , and go out of the room sometimes , when Aunt March <unk> , or people worry you ? &quot;
asked Jo , feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before .
&quot; Yes , I &apos;ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips ; and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will , I just go away a minute , and give myself a little shake , for being so weak and wicked , &quot; answered Mrs. March , with a sigh and a smile , as she smoothed and fastened up Jo &apos;s dishevelled hair .
&quot; How did you learn to keep still ?
That is what troubles <unk> the sharp words fly out before I know what I &apos;m about ; and the more I say the worse I get , till it &apos;s a pleasure to hurt people &apos;s feelings , and say dreadful things .
Tell me how you do it , Marmee dear . &quot;
&quot; My good mother used to help <unk> &quot; &quot; As you do <unk> &quot; interrupted Jo , with a grateful kiss .
&quot; But I lost her when I was a little older than you are , and for years had to struggle on alone , for I was too proud to confess my <unk> to any one else .
I had a hard time , Jo , and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures ; for , in spite of my efforts , I never seemed to get on .
Then your father came , and I was so happy that I found it easy to be good .
But by and by , when I had four little daughters round me , and we were poor , then the old trouble began again ; for I am not patient by nature , and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything . &quot;
&quot; Poor mother !
what helped you then ? &quot;
&quot; Your father , Jo .
He never <unk> patience , <unk> doubts or <unk> , --but always hopes , and works and <unk> so cheerfully , that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him .
He helped and comforted me , and showed me that I must try to practise all the virtues I would have my little girls possess , for I was their example .
It was easier to try for your <unk> than for my own ; a startled or surprised look from one of you , when I spoke sharply , <unk> me more than any words could have done ; and the love , respect , and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them copy . &quot;
&quot; O mother , if I &apos;m ever half as good as you , I shall be satisfied , &quot; cried Jo , much touched .
&quot; I hope you will be a great deal better , dear ; but you must keep watch over your &apos; bosom enemy , &apos; as father calls it , or it may <unk> , if not spoil your life .
You have had a warning ; remember it , and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper , before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known to-day . &quot;
&quot; I will try , mother ; I truly will .
But you must help me , remind me , and keep me from flying out .
I used to see father sometimes put his finger on his lips , and look at you with a very kind , but sober face , and you always folded your lips tight or went away : was he <unk> you then ? &quot;
asked Jo softly .
&quot; Yes ; I asked him to help me so , and he never forgot it , but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look . &quot;
Jo saw that her mother &apos;s eyes filled and her lips trembled , as she spoke ; and , fearing that she had said too much , she whispered anxiously , &quot; Was it wrong to watch you , and to speak of it ?
I didn &apos;t mean to be rude , but it &apos;s so comfortable to say all I think to you , and feel so safe and happy here . &quot;
&quot; My Jo , you may say anything to your mother , for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls <unk> in me , and know how much I love them . &quot;
&quot; I thought I &apos;d grieved you . &quot;
&quot; No , dear ; but speaking of father reminded me how much I miss him , how much I owe him , and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him . &quot;
&quot; <unk> you told him to go , mother , and didn &apos;t cry when he went , and never complain now , or seem as if you needed any help , &quot; said Jo , wondering .
&quot; I gave my best to the country I love , and kept my tears till he was gone .
Why should I complain , when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end ?
If I don &apos;t seem to need help , it is because I have a better friend , even than father , to comfort and sustain me .
My child , the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning , and may be many ; but you can overcome and <unk> them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your <unk> Father as you do that of your <unk> one .
The more you love and trust Him , the nearer you will feel to Him , and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom .
His love and care never tire or change , can never be taken from you , but may become the <unk> of <unk> peace , happiness , and strength .
<unk> this heartily , and go to God with all your little cares , and hopes , and sins , and sorrows , as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother . &quot;
Jo &apos;s only answer was to hold her mother close , and , in the silence which followed , the <unk> prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words ; for in that sad , yet happy hour , she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair , but the sweetness of self-denial and <unk> ; and , led by her mother &apos;s hand , she had drawn nearer to the Friend who <unk> every child with a love stronger than that of any father , <unk> than that of any mother .
Amy stirred , and sighed in her sleep ; and , as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault , Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before .
&quot; I let the sun go down on my anger ; I wouldn &apos;t forgive her , and to-day , if it hadn &apos;t been for Laurie , it might have been too late !
How could I be so wicked ? &quot;
said Jo , half aloud , as she leaned over her sister , softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow .
As if she heard , Amy opened her eyes , and held out her arms , with a smile that went straight to Jo &apos;s heart .
Neither said a word , but they hugged one another close , in spite of the <unk> , and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> the go abroady trunk &#93; <unk> .
MEG <unk> TO <unk> <unk> .
&quot; I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the <unk> just now , &quot; said Meg , one April day , as she stood <unk> the &quot; go abroady &quot; trunk in her room , surrounded by her sisters .
&quot; And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise .
A whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid , &quot; replied Jo , looking like a <unk> , as she folded skirts with her long arms .
&quot; And such lovely weather ; I &apos;m so glad of that , &quot; added Beth , <unk> sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box , lent for the great occasion .
&quot; I wish I was going to have a fine time , and wear all these nice things , &quot; said Amy , with her mouth full of pins , as she artistically <unk> her sister &apos;s cushion .
&quot; I wish you were all going ; but , as you can &apos;t , I shall keep my adventures to tell you when I come back .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s the least I can do , when you have been so kind , lending me things , and helping me get ready , &quot; said Meg , glancing round the room at the very simple <unk> , which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes .
&quot; What did mother give you out of the <unk> ? &quot;
asked Amy , who had not been present at the opening of a certain <unk> chest , in which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor , as gifts for her girls when the proper time came .
&quot; A pair of silk stockings , that pretty <unk> fan , and a lovely blue sash .
I wanted the violet silk ; but there isn &apos;t time to make it over , so I must be contented with my old tarlatan . &quot;
&quot; It will look nicely over my new muslin skirt , and the sash will set it off beautifully .
I wish I hadn &apos;t smashed my <unk> bracelet , for you might have had it , &quot; said Jo , who loved to give and lend , but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use .
&quot; There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the <unk> ; but mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl , and Laurie promised to send me all I want , &quot; replied Meg .
&quot; Now , let me see ; there &apos;s my new gray <unk> curl up the feather in my hat , Beth , <unk> my <unk> , for <unk> , and the small party , --it looks heavy for spring , doesn &apos;t it ?
The violet silk would be so nice ; oh , dear ! &quot;
&quot; Never mind ; you &apos;ve got the tarlatan for the big party , and you always look like an angel in white , &quot; said Amy , <unk> over the little store of <unk> in which her soul delighted .
&quot; It isn &apos;t <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t sweep enough , but it will have to do .
My blue <unk> looks so well , turned and freshly trimmed , that I feel as if I &apos;d got a new one .
My silk <unk> isn &apos;t a bit the fashion , and my bonnet doesn &apos;t look like Sallie &apos;s ; I didn &apos;t like to say anything , but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella .
I told mother black , with a white handle , but she forgot , and bought a green one , with a <unk> handle .
It &apos;s strong and neat , so I ought not to complain , but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie &apos;s silk one with a gold top , &quot; sighed Meg , surveying the little umbrella with great <unk> .
&quot; <unk> it , &quot; advised Jo .
&quot; I won &apos;t be so silly , or hurt Marmee &apos;s feelings , when she took so much <unk> to get my things .
It &apos;s a nonsensical notion of mine , and I &apos;m not going to give up to it .
My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort .
You are a dear , to lend me yours , Jo .
I feel so rich , and sort of elegant , with two new pairs , and the old ones cleaned up for common ; &quot; and Meg took a refreshing peep at her <unk> .
&quot; Annie Moffat has blue and pink <unk> on her <unk> ; would you put some on mine ? &quot;
she asked , as Beth brought up a pile of snowy <unk> , fresh from Hannah &apos;s hands .
&quot; No , I wouldn &apos;t ; for the smart caps won &apos;t match the plain gowns , without any trimming on them .
Poor folks shouldn &apos;t <unk> , &quot; said Jo decidedly .
&quot; I wonder if I shall _ ever _ be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes , and <unk> on my caps ? &quot;
said Meg impatiently .
&quot; You said the other day that you &apos;d be perfectly happy if you could only go to Annie Moffat &apos;s , &quot; observed Beth , in her quiet way .
&quot; So I did !
Well , I _ am _ happy , and I _ won &apos;t _ fret ; but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants , doesn &apos;t it ?
There , now , the <unk> are ready , and everything in but my ball-dress , which I shall leave for mother to <unk> , &quot; said Meg , cheering up , as she glanced from the <unk> trunk to the <unk> pressed and mended white tarlatan , which she called her &quot; ball-dress , &quot; with an important air .
The next day was fine , and Meg departed , in style , for a fortnight of <unk> and pleasure .
Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather reluctantly , fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented than she went .
But she had begged so hard , and Sallie had promised to take good care of her , and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work , that the mother yielded , and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life .
The Moffats _ were _ very fashionable , and simple Meg was rather daunted , at first , by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its <unk> .
But they were kindly people , in spite of the frivolous life they led , and soon put their guest at her ease .
Perhaps Meg felt , without <unk> why , that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people , and that all their <unk> could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made .
It certainly was agreeable to fare <unk> , drive in a fine carriage , wear her best frock every day , and do nothing but enjoy herself .
It suited her exactly ; and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her ; to put on little airs and graces , use French phrases , <unk> her hair , take in her dresses , and talk about the fashions as well as she could .
The more she saw of Annie Moffat &apos;s pretty things , the more she <unk> her , and sighed to be rich .
Home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it , work grew harder than ever , and she felt that she was a very <unk> and <unk> girl , in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings .
She had not much time for <unk> , however , for the three young girls were busily employed in &quot; having a good time . &quot;
They <unk> , walked , rode , and called all day ; went to theatres and <unk> , or frolicked at home in the evening ; for Annie had many friends , and knew how to entertain them .
Her older sisters were very fine young ladies , and one was engaged , which was <unk> interesting and romantic , Meg thought .
Mr. Moffat was a fat , jolly old gentleman , who knew her father ; and Mrs. Moffat , a fat , jolly old lady , who took as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter had done .
Every one petted her ; and &quot; Daisy , &quot; as they called her , was in a fair way to have her head turned .
When the evening for the &quot; small party &quot; came , she found that the <unk> wouldn &apos;t do at all , for the other girls were putting on thin dresses , and making themselves very fine indeed ; so out came the tarlatan , looking older , <unk> , and <unk> than ever beside Sallie &apos;s <unk> new one .
Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another , and her cheeks began to burn , for , with all her <unk> , she was very proud .
No one said a word about it , but Sallie offered to dress her hair , and Annie to tie her sash , and Belle , the engaged sister , praised her white arms ; but in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty , and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself , while the others laughed , chattered , and flew about like <unk> <unk> .
The hard , bitter feeling was getting pretty bad , when the maid brought in a box of flowers .
Before she could speak , Annie had the cover off , and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses , <unk> , and <unk> within .
&quot; It &apos;s for Belle , of course ; George always sends her some , but these are altogether <unk> , &quot; cried Annie , with a great sniff .
&quot; They are for Miss March , the man said .
And here &apos;s a note , &quot; put in the maid , holding it to Meg .
&quot; What fun !
Who are they from ?
Didn &apos;t know you had a lover , &quot; cried the girls , <unk> about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise .
&quot; The note is from mother , and the flowers from Laurie , &quot; said Meg simply , yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her .
&quot; Oh , indeed ! &quot;
said Annie , with a funny look , as Meg slipped the note into her pocket , as a sort of talisman against envy , vanity , and <unk> pride ; for the few loving words had done her good , and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty .
Feeling almost happy again , she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself , and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the <unk> , hair , or skirts of her friends , offering them so prettily that Clara , the elder sister , told her she was &quot; the sweetest little thing she ever saw ; &quot; and they looked quite charmed with her small attention .
Somehow the kind act finished her <unk> ; and when all the rest went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat , she saw a happy , bright-eyed face in the mirror , as she laid her ferns against her <unk> hair , and fastened the roses in the dress that didn &apos;t <unk> her as so _ very _ shabby now .
She enjoyed herself very much that evening , for she danced to her heart &apos;s content ; every one was very kind , and she had three compliments .
Annie made her sing , and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice ; Major <unk> asked who &quot; the fresh little girl , with the beautiful eyes , &quot; was ; and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her , because she &quot; didn &apos;t dawdle , but had some spring in her , &quot; as he gracefully expressed it .
So , altogether , she had a very nice time , till she <unk> a bit of a conversation , which disturbed her <unk> .
She was sitting just inside the conservatory , waiting for her partner to bring her an ice , when she heard a voice ask , on the other side of the <unk> wall , -- &quot; How old is he ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> or seventeen , I should say , &quot; replied another voice .
&quot; It would be a grand thing for one of those girls , wouldn &apos;t it ?
Sallie says they are very intimate now , and the old man quite <unk> on them . &quot;
&quot; <unk> M. has made her plans , I dare say , and will play her cards well , early as it is .
The girl evidently doesn &apos;t think of it yet , &quot; said Mrs. Moffat .
&quot; She told that fib about her mamma , as if she did know , and colored up when the flowers came , quite prettily .
Poor thing !
she &apos;d be so nice if she was only got up in style .
Do you think she &apos;d be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for Thursday ? &quot;
asked another voice .
&quot; She &apos;s proud , but I don &apos;t believe she &apos;d mind , for that dowdy tarlatan is all she has got .
She may tear it to-night , and that will be a good excuse for offering a <unk> one . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ll see .
I shall ask young Laurence , as a compliment to her , and we &apos;ll have fun about it afterward . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Meg &apos;s partner appeared &#93; Here Meg &apos;s partner appeared , to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated .
She _ was _ proud , and her pride was useful just then , for it helped her hide her mortification , anger , and disgust at what she had just heard ; for , innocent and <unk> as she was , she could not help <unk> the gossip of her friends .
She tried to forget it , but could not , and kept repeating to herself , &quot; Mrs. M. has made her plans , &quot; &quot; that fib about her mamma , &quot; and &quot; dowdy tarlatan , &quot; till she was ready to cry , and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice .
As that was impossible , she did her best to seem gay ; and , being rather excited , she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making .
She was very glad when it was all over , and she was quiet in her bed , where she could think and wonder and <unk> till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears .
Those foolish , yet <unk> words , had opened a new world to Meg , and much disturbed the peace of the old one , in which , till now , she had lived as happily as a child .
Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoilt by the silly speeches she had <unk> ; her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans <unk> to her by Mrs. Moffat , who <unk> others by herself ; and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man &apos;s daughter , was <unk> by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest <unk> under heaven .
Poor Meg had a restless night , and got up <unk> , unhappy , half resentful toward her friends , and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly , and setting everything right .
Everybody <unk> that morning , and it was <unk> before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work .
Something in the manner of her friends struck Meg at once ; they treated her with more respect , she thought ; took quite a tender interest in what she said , and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity .
All this surprised and flattered her , though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her writing , and said , with a sentimental air , -- &quot; Daisy , dear , I &apos;ve sent an invitation to your friend , Mr. Laurence , for Thursday .
We should like to know him , and it &apos;s only a proper compliment to you . &quot;
Meg colored , but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply <unk> , -- &quot; You are very kind , but I &apos;m afraid he won &apos;t come . &quot;
&quot; Why not , _ ch ? <unk> _ ? &quot;
asked Miss Belle .
&quot; He &apos;s too old . &quot;
&quot; My child , what do you mean ?
What is his age , I beg to know ! &quot;
cried Miss Clara .
&quot; <unk> seventy , I believe , &quot; answered Meg , <unk> stitches , to hide the merriment in her eyes .
&quot; You sly creature !
Of course we meant the young man , &quot; exclaimed Miss Belle , laughing .
&quot; There isn &apos;t any ; Laurie is only a little boy , &quot; and Meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover .
&quot; About your age , &quot; <unk> said .
&quot; <unk> my sister Jo &apos;s ; _ I _ am seventeen in <unk> , &quot; returned Meg , tossing her head .
&quot; It &apos;s very nice of him to send you flowers , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
said Annie , looking wise about nothing .
&quot; Yes , he often does , to all of us ; for their house is full , and we are so fond of them .
My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends , you know , so it is quite natural that we children should play together ; &quot; and Meg hoped they would say no more .
&quot; It &apos;s evident Daisy isn &apos;t out yet , &quot; said Miss Clara to Belle , with a nod .
&quot; Quite a <unk> state of <unk> all round , &quot; returned Miss Belle , with a shrug .
&quot; I &apos;m going out to get some little matters for my girls ; can I do anything for you , young ladies ? &quot;
asked Mrs. Moffat , <unk> in , like an <unk> , in silk and lace .
&quot; No , thank you , ma &apos;am , &quot; replied Sallie .
&quot; I &apos;ve got my new pink silk for Thursday , and don &apos;t want a thing . &quot;
&quot; Nor I , -- &quot; began Meg , but stopped , because it occurred to her that she _ did _ want several things , and could not have them .
&quot; What shall you wear ? &quot;
asked Sallie .
&quot; My old white one again , if I can mend it fit to be seen ; it got sadly torn last night , &quot; said Meg , trying to speak quite easily , but feeling very uncomfortable .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you send home for another ? &quot;
said Sallie , who was not an observing young lady .
&quot; I haven &apos;t got any other . &quot;
It cost Meg an effort to say that , but Sallie did not see it , and exclaimed , in amiable surprise , -- &quot; Only that ?
How <unk> &quot; She did not finish her speech , for Belle shook her head at her , and broke in , saying kindly , -- &quot; Not at all ; where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn &apos;t out ?
There &apos;s no need of sending home , Daisy , even if you had a dozen , for I &apos;ve got a sweet blue silk laid away , which I &apos;ve <unk> , and you shall wear it , to please me , won &apos;t you , dear ? &quot;
&quot; You are very kind , but I don &apos;t mind my old dress , if you don &apos;t ; it does well enough for a little girl like me , &quot; said Meg .
&quot; Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style .
I admire to do it , and you &apos;d be a regular little beauty , with a touch here and there .
I sha &apos;n&apos;t let any one see you till you are done , and then we &apos;ll burst upon them like <unk> and her <unk> , going to the ball , &quot; said Belle , in her persuasive tone .
Meg couldn &apos;t refuse the offer so kindly made , for a desire to see if she would be &quot; a little beauty &quot; after touching up , caused her to accept , and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings towards the Moffats .
On the Thursday evening , Belle shut herself up with her maid ; and , between them , they turned Meg into a fine lady .
They <unk> and <unk> her hair , they <unk> her neck and arms with some fragrant <unk> , touched her lips with <unk> <unk> , to make them redder , and Hortense would have added &quot; a _ <unk> ? on _ of <unk> , &quot; if Meg had not rebelled .
They <unk> her into a sky-blue dress , which was so tight she could hardly <unk> , and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in the mirror .
A set of silver <unk> was added , <unk> , necklace , <unk> , and even ear-rings , for Hortense tied them on , with a bit of pink silk , which did not show .
A <unk> of <unk> at the bosom , and a _ <unk> _ , <unk> Meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders , and a pair of high-heeled blue silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart .
A <unk> handkerchief , a <unk> fan , and a bouquet in a silver holder finished her off ; and Miss Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll .
&quot; Mademoiselle is <unk> , <unk> ? s <unk> , is she not ? &quot;
cried Hortense , <unk> her hands in an affected rapture .
&quot; Come and show yourself , &quot; said Miss Belle , leading the way to the room where the others were waiting .
As Meg went rustling after , with her long skirts <unk> , her ear-rings <unk> , her curls waving , and her heart <unk> , she felt as if her &quot; fun &quot; had really begun at last , for the mirror had plainly told her that she _ was _ &quot; a little beauty . &quot;
Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase <unk> ; and , for several minutes , she stood , like the <unk> in the fable , enjoying her borrowed <unk> , while the rest chattered like a party of <unk> .
&quot; While I dress , do you <unk> her , <unk> , in the management of her skirt , and those French heels , or she will trip herself up .
Take your silver <unk> , and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head , Clara , and don &apos;t any of you disturb the charming work of my hands , &quot; said Belle , as she hurried away , looking well pleased with her success .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to go down , I feel so queer and stiff and <unk> , &quot; said Meg to Sallie , as the bell rang , and Mrs. Moffat sent to ask the young ladies to appear at once .
&quot; You don &apos;t look a bit like yourself , but you are very nice .
I &apos;m <unk> beside you , for Belle has heaps of taste , and you &apos;re quite French , I assure you .
Let your flowers hang ; don &apos;t be so careful of them , and be sure you don &apos;t trip , &quot; returned Sallie , trying not to care that Meg was prettier than herself .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> to be introduced &#93; <unk> that warning carefully in mind , Margaret got safely down stairs , and sailed into the <unk> , where the Moffats and a few early guests were assembled .
She very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which <unk> a certain class of people , and <unk> their respect .
<unk> young ladies , who had taken no notice of her before , were very affectionate all of a sudden ; several young gentlemen , who had only stared at her at the other party , now not only stared , but asked to be introduced , and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her ; and several old ladies , who sat on <unk> , and criticised the rest of the party , inquired who she was , with an air of interest .
She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them , -- &quot; Daisy <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> of our first families , but <unk> of fortune , you know ; intimate friends of the Laurences ; sweet creature , I assure you ; my Ned is quite wild about her . &quot;
&quot; Dear me ! &quot;
said the old lady , putting up her glass for another observation of Meg , who tried to look as if she had not heard , and been rather <unk> at Mrs. Moffat &apos;s <unk> .
The &quot; queer feeling &quot; did not pass away , but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady , and so got on pretty well , though the tight dress gave her a <unk> , the train kept getting under her feet , and she was in constant fear lest her ear-rings should fly off , and get lost or broken .
She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty , when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked <unk> ; for , just opposite , she saw Laurie .
He was staring at her with <unk> surprise , and <unk> also , she thought ; for , though he bowed and smiled , yet something in his honest eyes made her blush , and wish she had her old dress on .
To complete her confusion , she saw Belle <unk> Annie , and both glance from her to Laurie , who , she was happy to see , looked unusually boyish and shy .
&quot; <unk> creatures , to put such thoughts into my head !
I won &apos;t care for it , or let it change me a bit , &quot; thought Meg , and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend .
&quot; I &apos;m glad you came , I was afraid you wouldn &apos;t , &quot; she said , with her most grown-up air .
&quot; Jo wanted me to come , and tell her how you looked , so I did ; &quot; answered Laurie , without turning his eyes upon her , though he half smiled at her maternal tone .
&quot; What shall you tell her ? &quot;
asked Meg , full of curiosity to know his opinion of her , yet feeling ill at ease with him , for the first time .
&quot; I shall say I didn &apos;t know you ; for you look so grown-up , and unlike yourself , I &apos;m quite afraid of you , &quot; he said , <unk> at his <unk> .
&quot; How absurd of you !
The girls dressed me up for fun , and I rather like it .
Wouldn &apos;t Jo stare if she saw me ? &quot;
said Meg , bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not .
&quot; Yes , I think she would , &quot; returned Laurie gravely .
&quot; Don &apos;t you like me so ? &quot;
asked Meg .
&quot; No , I don &apos;t , &quot; was the blunt reply .
&quot; Why not ? &quot;
in an anxious tone .
He glanced at her <unk> head , bare shoulders , and <unk> trimmed dress , with an expression that abashed her more than his answer , which had not a particle of his usual <unk> about it .
&quot; I don &apos;t like fuss and feathers . &quot;
That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself ; and Meg walked away , saying petulantly , -- &quot; You are the <unk> boy I ever saw . &quot;
Feeling very much ruffled , she went and stood at a quiet window , to cool her cheeks , for the tight dress gave her an <unk> brilliant color .
As she stood there , Major <unk> passed by ; and , a minute after , she heard him saying to his mother , -- &quot; They are making a fool of that little girl ; I wanted you to see her , but they have spoilt her entirely ; she &apos;s nothing but a doll , to-night . &quot;
&quot; Oh , dear ! &quot;
sighed Meg ; &quot; I wish I &apos;d been sensible , and worn my own things ; then I should not have disgusted other people , or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed myself . &quot;
She leaned her forehead on the cool <unk> , and stood half hidden by the curtains , never <unk> that her favorite <unk> had begun , till some one touched her ; and , turning , she saw Laurie , looking penitent , as he said , with his very best bow , and his hand out , -- &quot; Please forgive my <unk> , and come and dance with me . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid it will be too disagreeable to you , &quot; said Meg , trying to look offended , and failing entirely .
&quot; Not a bit of it ; I &apos;m dying to do it .
Come , I &apos;ll be good ; I don &apos;t like your gown , but I do think you <unk> splendid ; &quot; and he waved his hands , as if words failed to express his admiration .
Meg smiled and <unk> , and whispered , as they stood waiting to catch the time , -- &quot; Take care my skirt don &apos;t trip you up ; it &apos;s the plague of my life , and I was a goose to wear it . &quot;
&quot; <unk> it round your neck , and then it will be useful , &quot; said Laurie , looking down at the little blue boots , which he evidently <unk> of .
Away they went , <unk> and gracefully ; for , having practised at home , they were well <unk> , and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see , as they <unk> merrily round and round , feeling more friendly than ever after their small <unk> .
&quot; Laurie , I want you to do me a favor ; will you ? &quot;
said Meg , as he stood <unk> her , when her breath gave out , which it did very soon , though she would not own why .
&quot; Won &apos;t I ! &quot;
said Laurie , with <unk> .
&quot; Please don &apos;t tell them at home about my dress to-night .
They won &apos;t understand the joke , and it will worry mother . &quot;
&quot; Then why did you do it ? &quot;
said Laurie &apos;s eyes , so plainly that Meg hastily added , -- &quot; I shall tell them , myself , all about it , and &apos; &apos; fess &apos; to mother how silly I &apos;ve been .
But I &apos;d rather do it myself ; so you &apos;ll not tell , will you ? &quot;
&quot; I give you my word I won &apos;t ; only what shall I say when they ask me ? &quot;
&quot; Just say I looked pretty well , and was having a good time . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll say the first , with all my heart ; but how about the other ?
You don &apos;t look as if you were having a good time ; are you ? &quot;
and Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer , in a whisper , -- &quot; No ; not just now .
Don &apos;t think I &apos;m horrid ; I only wanted a little fun , but this sort doesn &apos;t pay , I find , and I &apos;m getting tired of it . &quot;
&quot; Here comes Ned Moffat ; what does he want ? &quot;
said Laurie , knitting his black brows , as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party .
&quot; He put his name down for three dances , and I suppose he &apos;s coming for them .
What a bore ! &quot;
said Meg , <unk> a <unk> air , which amused Laurie immensely .
He did not speak to her again till <unk> , when he saw her <unk> <unk> with Ned and his friend <unk> , who were <unk> &quot; like a pair of <unk> , &quot; as Laurie said to himself , for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches , and fight their <unk> whenever a <unk> was needed .
&#91; Illustration : I wouldn &apos;t , Meg &#93; &quot; You &apos;ll have a <unk> headache to-morrow , if you drink much of that .
I wouldn &apos;t Meg ; your mother doesn &apos;t like it , you know , &quot; he whispered , leaning over her chair , as Ned turned to <unk> her glass , and <unk> stooped to pick up her fan .
&quot; I &apos;m not Meg , to-night ; I &apos;m &apos; a doll , &apos; who does all sorts of crazy things .
<unk> I shall put away my &apos; fuss and feathers , &apos; and be desperately good again , &quot; she answered , with an affected little laugh .
&quot; Wish to-morrow was here , then , &quot; muttered Laurie , walking off , <unk> at the change he saw in her .
Meg danced and flirted , chattered and <unk> , as the other girls did ; after supper she undertook the German , and blundered through it , nearly <unk> her partner with her long skirt , and romping in a way that scandalized Laurie , who looked on and <unk> a lecture .
But he got no chance to deliver it , for Meg kept away from him till he came to say good-night .
&quot; Remember ! &quot;
she said , trying to smile , for the <unk> headache had already begun .
&quot; <unk> ?
la <unk> , &quot; replied Laurie , with a melodramatic flourish , as he went away .
This little bit of <unk> excited Annie &apos;s curiosity ; but Meg was too tired for gossip , and went to bed , feeling as if she had been to a masquerade , and hadn &apos;t enjoyed herself as much as she expected .
She was sick all the next day , and on Saturday went home , quite used up with her fortnight &apos;s fun , and feeling that she had &quot; sat in the lap of luxury &quot; long enough .
&quot; It does seem pleasant to be quiet , and not have company manners on all the time .
Home _ is _ a nice place , though it isn &apos;t splendid , &quot; said Meg , looking about her with a <unk> expression , as she sat with her mother and Jo on the <unk> evening .
&quot; I &apos;m glad to hear you say so , dear , for I was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you , after your fine <unk> , &quot; replied her mother , who had given her many anxious looks that day ; for motherly eyes are quick to see any change in children &apos;s faces .
Meg had told her adventures gayly , and said over and over what a charming time she had had ; but something still seemed to <unk> upon her spirits , and , when the younger girls were gone to bed , she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire , saying little , and looking worried .
As the clock struck nine , and Jo proposed bed , Meg suddenly left her chair , and , taking Beth &apos;s stool , leaned her elbows on her mother &apos;s knee , saying bravely , -- &quot; Marmee , I want to &apos; &apos; fess . &apos; &quot;
&quot; I thought so ; what is it , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Shall I go away ? &quot;
asked Jo <unk> .
&quot; Of course not ; don &apos;t I always tell you everything ?
I was ashamed to speak of it before the children , but I want you to know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffat &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; We are prepared , &quot; said Mrs. March , smiling , but looking a little anxious .
&quot; I told you they dressed me up , but I didn &apos;t tell you that they <unk> and squeezed and <unk> , and made me look like a <unk> .
Laurie thought I wasn &apos;t proper ; I know he did , though he didn &apos;t say so , and one man called me &apos; a doll . &apos;
I knew it was silly , but they flattered me , and said I was a beauty , and quantities of nonsense , so I let them make a fool of me . &quot;
&quot; Is that all ? &quot;
asked Jo , as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter , and could not find it in her heart to blame her little <unk> .
&quot; No ; I drank <unk> and <unk> and tried to flirt , and was altogether abominable , &quot; said Meg <unk> .
&quot; There is something more , I think ; &quot; and Mrs. March smoothed the soft cheek , which suddenly grew rosy , as Meg answered slowly , -- &quot; Yes ; it &apos;s very silly , but I want to tell it , because I hate to have people say and think such things about us and Laurie . &quot;
Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats ; and , as she spoke , Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly , as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg &apos;s innocent mind .
&quot; Well , if that isn &apos;t the greatest rubbish I ever heard , &quot; cried Jo indignantly .
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you <unk> out and tell them so , on the spot ? &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t , it was so <unk> for me .
I couldn &apos;t help hearing , at first , and then I was so angry and ashamed , I didn &apos;t remember that I ought to go away . &quot;
&quot; Just wait till _ I _ see Annie Moffat , and I &apos;ll show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff .
The idea of having &apos; plans , &apos; and being kind to Laurie , because he &apos;s rich , and may marry us by and by !
Won &apos;t he shout , when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children ? &quot;
and Jo laughed , as if , on second thoughts , the thing struck her as a good joke .
&quot; If you tell Laurie , I &apos;ll never forgive you !
She mustn &apos;t , must she , mother ? &quot;
said Meg , looking distressed .
&quot; No ; never repeat that foolish gossip , and forget it as soon as you can , &quot; said Mrs. March gravely .
&quot; I was very <unk> to let you go among people of whom I know so little , <unk> , I dare say , but worldly , <unk> , and full of these vulgar ideas about young people .
I am more sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you , Meg . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be sorry , I won &apos;t let it hurt me ; I &apos;ll forget all the bad , and remember only the good ; for I did enjoy a great deal , and thank you very much for letting me go .
I &apos;ll not be sentimental or <unk> , mother ; I know I &apos;m a silly little girl , and I &apos;ll stay with you till I &apos;m fit to take care of myself .
But it _ is _ nice to be praised and admired , and I can &apos;t help saying I like it , &quot; said Meg , looking half ashamed of the <unk> .
&quot; That is perfectly natural , and quite harmless , if the liking does not become a passion , and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things .
<unk> to know and value the praise which is worth having , and to <unk> the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty , Meg . &quot;
Margaret sat thinking a moment , while Jo stood with her hands behind her , looking both interested and a little <unk> ; for it was a new thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration , lovers , and things of that sort ; and Jo felt as if , during that fortnight , her sister had grown up amazingly , and was <unk> away from her into a world where she could not follow .
&quot; Mother , do you have &apos; plans , &apos; as Mrs. Moffat said ? &quot;
asked Meg <unk> .
&quot; Yes , my dear , I have a great many ; all mothers do , but mine <unk> somewhat from Mrs. Moffat &apos;s , I suspect .
I will tell you some of them , for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right , on a very serious subject .
You are young , Meg , but not too young to understand me ; and mothers &apos; lips are the <unk> to speak of such things to girls like you .
Jo , your turn will come in time , perhaps , so listen to my &apos; plans , &apos; and help me carry them out , if they are good . &quot;
Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair , looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair .
Holding a hand of each , and watching the two young faces wistfully , Mrs. March said , in her serious yet cheery way , -- &#91; Illustration : Holding a hand of each , Mrs. March said , &amp; c . &#93; &quot; I want my daughters to be beautiful , accomplished , and good ; to be admired , loved , and respected ; to have a happy youth , to be well and wisely married , and to lead useful , pleasant lives , with as little care and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send .
To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman ; and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience .
It is natural to think of it , Meg ; right to hope and wait for it , and wise to prepare for it ; so that , when the happy time comes , you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy .
My dear girls , I _ am _ ambitious for you , but not to have you make a dash in the world , <unk> rich men merely because they are rich , or have splendid houses , which are not homes because love is wanting .
Money is a <unk> and precious thing , --and , when well used , a noble thing , --but I never want you to think it is the first or only prize to <unk> for .
I &apos;d rather see you poor men &apos;s wives , if you were happy , beloved , contented , than <unk> on <unk> , without <unk> and peace . &quot;
&quot; Poor girls don &apos;t stand any chance , Belle says , unless they put themselves forward , &quot; sighed Meg .
&quot; Then we &apos;ll be old maids , &quot; said Jo stoutly .
&quot; <unk> , Jo ; better be happy old maids than unhappy wives , or unmaidenly girls , running about to find <unk> , &quot; said Mrs. March decidedly .
&quot; Don &apos;t be troubled , Meg ; poverty seldom <unk> a sincere lover .
Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls , but so <unk> that they were not allowed to be old maids .
Leave these things to time ; make this home happy , so that you may be fit for homes of your own , if they are offered you , and contented here if they are not .
One thing remember , my girls : mother is always ready to be your confidant , father to be your friend ; and both of us trust and hope that our daughters , whether married or single , will be the pride and comfort of our lives . &quot;
&quot; We will , Marmee , we will ! &quot;
cried both , with all their hearts , as she bade them good-night .

THE P. C. AND P. O.
As spring came on , a new set of <unk> became the fashion , and the <unk> days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts .
The garden had to be put in order , and each sister had a <unk> of the little plot to do what she liked with .
Hannah used to say , &quot; I &apos;d know which each of them <unk> belonged to , ef I see &apos; em in <unk> ; &quot; and so she might , for the girls &apos; tastes <unk> as much as their characters .
Meg &apos;s had roses and <unk> , <unk> , and a little <unk> in it .
Jo &apos;s bed was never alike two <unk> , for she was always trying experiments ; this year it was to be a <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> of which cheerful and <unk> <unk> were to feed &quot; Aunt <unk> &quot; and her family of <unk> .
Beth had old-fashioned , fragrant flowers in her garden , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , pansies , and <unk> , with <unk> for the bird , and <unk> for the <unk> .
Amy had a bower in hers , --rather small and <unk> , but very pretty to look at , --with <unk> and <unk> hanging their colored <unk> and bells in graceful <unk> all over it ; tall , white lilies , delicate ferns , and as many brilliant , picturesque <unk> as would consent to blossom there .
<unk> , walks , <unk> on the river , and <unk> employed the fine days ; and for rainy ones , they had house <unk> , <unk> old , some new , --all more or less original .
One of these was the &quot; P. C. &quot; ; for , as secret <unk> were the fashion , it was thought proper to have one ; and , as all of the girls admired Dickens , they called themselves the Pickwick Club .
With a few <unk> , they had kept this up for a year , and met every Saturday evening in the big garret , on which occasions the ceremonies were as <unk> : Three chairs were arranged in a row before a table , on which was a lamp , also four white <unk> , with a big &quot; P. C. &quot; in different colors on each , and the weekly newspaper , called &quot; The Pickwick Portfolio , &quot; to which all <unk> something ; while Jo , who revelled in pens and ink , was the editor .
At seven o &apos;clock , the four members <unk> to the <unk> , tied their <unk> round their heads , and took their seats with great <unk> .
Meg , as the eldest , was Samuel Pickwick ; Jo , being of a literary turn , <unk> Snodgrass ; Beth , because she was round and rosy , <unk> Tupman , and Amy , who was always trying to do what she couldn &apos;t , was <unk> Winkle .
Pickwick , the <unk> , read the paper , which was filled with original tales , poetry , <unk> news , funny <unk> , and hints , in which they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short-comings .
&#91; Illustration : Mr. Pickwick &#93; On one occasion , Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glasses , <unk> upon the table , hemmed , and , having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass , who was <unk> back in his chair , till he arranged himself properly , began to read : -- The Pickwick Portfolio .
MAY <unk> , <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> we meet to <unk> With <unk> and solemn <unk> , Our <unk> <unk> , In Pickwick Hall , to-night .
We all are here in perfect health , None gone from our small band ; <unk> we see each well-known face , And <unk> each friendly hand .
Our Pickwick , always at his post , With reverence we greet , As , spectacles on nose , he <unk> Our <unk> weekly sheet .
<unk> he <unk> from a cold , We joy to hear him speak , For words of wisdom from him fall , In spite of croak or <unk> .
Old <unk> Snodgrass <unk> on high , With <unk> grace , And <unk> upon the company , With brown and jovial face .
<unk> fire <unk> up his eye , He struggles &apos; <unk> his lot .
<unk> ambition on his brow , And on his nose a <unk> !
Next our peaceful Tupman comes , So rosy , plump , and sweet .
Who <unk> with laughter at the <unk> , And <unk> off his seat .
<unk> little Winkle too is here , With every hair in place , A model of propriety , Though he hates to wash his face .
The year is gone , we still <unk> To joke and laugh and read , And tread the path of literature That <unk> to glory lead .
Long may our paper prosper well , Our club unbroken be , And coming years their blessings <unk> On the useful , gay &quot; P. C. &quot; A. <unk> .
THE <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> OF <unk> .
<unk> after <unk> swept up to the marble steps , and left its lovely load to <unk> the brilliant throng that filled the stately <unk> of Count de <unk> .
<unk> and ladies , elves and pages , <unk> and <unk> , all mingled gayly in the dance .
<unk> voices and rich melody filled the air ; and so with <unk> and music the masquerade went on .
&quot; Has your <unk> seen the Lady Viola to-night ? &quot;
asked a gallant <unk> of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm .
&quot; Yes ; is she not lovely , though so sad !
Her dress is well chosen , too , for in a week she <unk> Count <unk> , whom she passionately hates . &quot;
&quot; By my faith , I envy him .
<unk> he comes , <unk> like a bridegroom , except the black mask .
When that is off we shall see how he <unk> the fair maid whose heart he cannot win , though her stern father <unk> her hand , &quot; returned the <unk> .
&quot; &apos; <unk> whispered that she loves the young English artist who <unk> her steps , and is <unk> by the old count , &quot; said the lady , as they joined the dance .
The revel was at its <unk> when a <unk> appeared , and , <unk> the young pair to an <unk> hung with purple velvet , he <unk> them to <unk> .
<unk> silence fell upon the gay throng ; and not a sound , but the dash of <unk> or the rustle of <unk> <unk> in the moonlight , broke the <unk> , as Count de <unk> spoke thus : -- &quot; My lords and ladies , pardon the <unk> by which I have gathered you here to <unk> the marriage of my daughter .
Father , we wait your services . &quot;
All eyes turned toward the bridal party , and a low murmur of amazement went through the throng , for neither bride nor <unk> removed their <unk> .
<unk> and wonder possessed all hearts , but respect restrained all tongues till the <unk> <unk> was over .
Then the eager spectators gathered round the count , demanding an explanation .
&quot; <unk> would I give it if I could ; but I only know that it was the <unk> of my timid Viola , and I yielded to it .
Now , my children , let the play end .
<unk> , and receive my blessing . &quot;
But neither bent the knee ; for the young bridegroom replied , in a tone that startled all listeners , as the mask fell , <unk> the noble face of <unk> <unk> , the artist lover ; and , leaning on the breast where now flashed the <unk> of an English <unk> , was the lovely Viola , <unk> with joy and beauty .
&quot; My lord , you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when I could <unk> as high a name and <unk> a fortune as the Count <unk> .
I can do more ; for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , when he gives his ancient name and <unk> wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady , now my wife . &quot;
The count stood like one changed to stone ; and , turning to the bewildered <unk> , <unk> added , with a gay smile of triumph , &quot; To you , my gallant friends , I can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done ; and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have , by this <unk> marriage . &quot;

Once upon a time a <unk> <unk> a little <unk> in his garden , and after a while it <unk> and became a <unk> , and bore many <unk> .
One day in October , when they were ripe , he picked one and took it to market .
A <unk> bought and put it in his shop .
That same morning , a little girl , in a brown hat and blue dress , with a round face and snub nose , went and bought it for her mother .
She <unk> it home , cut it up , and boiled it in the big pot ; <unk> some of it , with salt and butter , for dinner ; and to the rest she added a <unk> of milk , two <unk> , four spoons of sugar , <unk> , and some <unk> ; put it in a deep dish , and <unk> it till it was brown and nice ; and next day it was eaten by a family named March .

A perfect scene of ruin met our eyes ; for in his fall Mr. Pickwick had <unk> his head and shoulders into a tub of water , upset a <unk> of soft soap upon his manly form , and torn his <unk> badly .

This lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large * * circle of warm and admiring friends ; for her beauty * * attracted all eyes , her graces and virtues <unk> her to * * all hearts , and her loss is deeply felt by the whole * * <unk> .
* * * * When last seen , she was sitting at the gate , watching the * * butcher &apos;s <unk> ; and it is feared that some villain , tempted * * by her charms , basely stole her .
<unk> have passed , but no * * <unk> of her has been discovered ; and we <unk> all * * hope , tie a black ribbon to her basket , set aside her dish , * * and weep for her as one lost to us forever .

We <unk> the loss of our little pet , And sigh o &apos;er her <unk> fate , For never more by the fire she &apos;ll sit , Nor play by the old green gate .
The little grave where her infant sleeps , Is &apos; <unk> the chestnut tree ; But o &apos;er _ her _ grave we may not weep , We know not where it may be .
Her empty bed , her idle ball , Will never see her more ; No gentle tap , no loving <unk> Is heard at the <unk> .
Another cat comes after her mice , A cat with a dirty face ; But she does not hunt as our darling did , Nor play with her airy grace .
Her <unk> <unk> tread the very hall Where <unk> used to play , But she only <unk> at the dogs our pet So gallantly drove away .
She is useful and mild , and does her best , But she is not fair to see ; And we cannot give her your place , dear , Nor worship her as we worship thee .

As the President finished reading the paper ( which I beg leave to assure my readers is a _ <unk> <unk> _ copy of one written by _ <unk> <unk> _ girls once upon a time ) , a round of applause followed , and then Mr. Snodgrass rose to make a <unk> .
&quot; Mr. President and gentlemen , &quot; he began , <unk> a <unk> attitude and tone , &quot; I wish to propose the admission of a new member , --one who highly <unk> the honor , would be deeply grateful for it , and would add immensely to the spirit of the club , the literary value of the paper , and be no end jolly and nice .
I propose Mr. Theodore Laurence as an <unk> member of the P. C. Come now , do have him . &quot;
Jo &apos;s sudden change of tone made the girls laugh ; but all looked rather anxious , and no one said a word , as Snodgrass took his seat .
&quot; We &apos;ll put it to vote , &quot; said the President .
&quot; All in favor of this motion please to <unk> it by saying &apos; Ay . &apos; &quot;
A loud <unk> from Snodgrass , followed , to everybody &apos;s surprise , by a timid one from Beth .
&quot; <unk> minded say &apos; No . &apos; &quot;
Meg and Amy were contrary minded ; and Mr. Winkle rose to say , with great elegance , &quot; We don &apos;t wish any boys ; they only joke and bounce about .
This is a ladies &apos; club , and we wish to be private and proper . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid he &apos;ll laugh at our paper , and make fun of us afterward , &quot; observed Pickwick , pulling the little curl on her forehead , as she always did when <unk> .
Up rose Snodgrass , very much in earnest .
&quot; Sir , I give you my word as a gentleman , Laurie won &apos;t do anything of the sort .
He likes to write , and he &apos;ll give a tone to our contributions , and keep us from being sentimental , don &apos;t you see ?
We can do so little for him , and he does so much for us , I think the least we can do is to offer him a place here , and make him welcome if he comes . &quot;
This artful <unk> to <unk> conferred brought Tupman to his feet , looking as if he had quite made up his mind .
&quot; Yes , we ought to do it , even if we _ are _ afraid .
I say he _ may _ come , and his grandpa , too , if he likes . &quot;
This <unk> burst from Beth electrified the club , and Jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly .
&quot; Now then , vote again .
Everybody remember it &apos;s our Laurie , and say &apos; Ay ! &apos; &quot;
cried Snodgrass excitedly .
&quot; Ay !
<unk> !
<unk> ! &quot;
replied three voices at once .
&quot; Good !
Bless you !
Now , as there &apos;s nothing like &apos; taking time by the _ fetlock _ , &apos; as Winkle <unk> <unk> , allow me to present the new member ; &quot; and , to the dismay of the rest of the club , Jo threw open the door of the closet , and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag-bag , flushed and <unk> with suppressed laughter .
&#91; Illustration : Jo threw open the door of the closet &#93; &quot; You <unk> !
you <unk> !
Jo , how could you ? &quot;
cried the three girls , as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth ; and , producing both a chair and a <unk> , <unk> him in a jiffy .
&quot; The <unk> of you two rascals is <unk> , &quot; began Mr. Pickwick , trying to get up an awful frown , and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile .
But the new member was equal to the occasion ; and , rising , with a grateful <unk> to the <unk> , said , in the most engaging manner , &quot; Mr. President and ladies , --I beg pardon , gentlemen , <unk> me to <unk> myself as Sam Weller , the very humble servant of the club . &quot;
&quot; Good !
good ! &quot;
cried Jo , <unk> with the handle of the old warming-pan on which she leaned .
&quot; My faithful friend and noble <unk> , &quot; continued Laurie , with a wave of the hand , &quot; who has so <unk> presented me , is not to be <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of to-night .
I planned it , and she only gave in after lots of <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Come now , don &apos;t lay it all on yourself ; you know I proposed the <unk> , &quot; broke in Snodgrass , who was enjoying the joke amazingly .
&quot; Never you mind what she says .
I &apos;m the wretch that did it , sir , &quot; said the new member , with a <unk> nod to Mr. Pickwick .
&quot; But on my honor , I never will do so again , and <unk> _ <unk> _ myself to the interest of this immortal club . &quot;
&quot; <unk> !
hear ! &quot;
cried Jo , <unk> the lid of the warming-pan like a <unk> .
&quot; Go on , go on ! &quot;
added Winkle and Tupman , while the President bowed benignly .
&quot; I merely wish to say , that as a slight <unk> of my gratitude for the honor done me , and as a means of promoting friendly relations between <unk> nations , I have set up a post-office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden ; a fine , <unk> <unk> , with <unk> on the doors , and every <unk> for the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , if I may be allowed the expression .
It &apos;s the old <unk> ; but I &apos;ve stopped up the door , and made the roof open , so it will hold all sorts of things , and save our valuable time .
Letters , manuscripts , books , and bundles can be passed in there ; and , as each nation has a key , it will be uncommonly nice , I fancy .
<unk> me to present the club key ; and , with many thanks for your favor , take my seat . &quot;
<unk> applause as Mr. Weller <unk> a little key on the table , and subsided ; the warming-pan clashed and waved wildly , and it was some time before order could be <unk> .
A long discussion followed , and every one came out <unk> , for every one did her best ; so it was an unusually lively meeting , and did not <unk> till a late hour , when it broke up with three <unk> cheers for the new member .
No one ever regretted the <unk> of Sam Weller , for a more devoted , <unk> , and jovial member no club could have .
He certainly did add &quot; spirit &quot; to the <unk> , and &quot; a tone &quot; to the paper ; for his <unk> convulsed his <unk> , and his contributions were excellent , being <unk> , <unk> , comical , or dramatic , but never sentimental .
Jo regarded them as worthy of <unk> , <unk> , or Shakespeare ; and <unk> her own works with good effect , she thought .
The P. O. was a capital little institution , and flourished wonderfully , for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real office .
Tragedies and <unk> , poetry and <unk> , <unk> and long letters , music and gingerbread , rubbers , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
The old gentleman liked the fun , and amused himself by sending odd bundles , mysterious messages , and funny <unk> ; and his <unk> , who was <unk> with Hannah &apos;s charms , actually sent a <unk> to Jo &apos;s care .
How they laughed when the secret came out , never dreaming how many <unk> that little post-office would hold in the years to come !
&#91; Illustration : Jo spent the morning on the river &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
&quot; The first of June !
The Kings are off to the <unk> to-morrow , and I &apos;m free .
Three months &apos; vacation , --how I shall enjoy it ! &quot;
exclaimed Meg , coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual state of <unk> , while Beth took off her dusty boots , and Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party .
&quot; Aunt March went to-day , for which , oh , be joyful ! &quot;
said Jo .
&quot; I was mortally afraid she &apos;d ask me to go with her ; if she had , I should have felt as if I ought to do it ; but Plumfield is about as gay as a <unk> , you know , and I &apos;d rather be <unk> .
We had a flurry getting the old lady off , and I had a fright every time she spoke to me , for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly helpful and sweet , and feared she &apos;d find it impossible to part from me .
I <unk> till she was fairly in the carriage , and had a final fright , for , as it drove off , she popped out her head , saying , &apos; Josy-phine , won &apos;t you-- ? &apos;
I didn &apos;t hear any more , for I basely turned and fled ; I did actually run , and whisked round the corner , where I felt safe . &quot;
&quot; Poor old Jo !
she came in looking as if bears were after her , &quot; said Beth , as she cuddled her sister &apos;s feet with a motherly air .
&quot; Aunt March is a regular <unk> , is she not ? &quot;
observed Amy , <unk> her mixture <unk> .
&quot; She means _ <unk> _ , not <unk> ; but it doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s too warm to be particular about one &apos;s parts of speech , &quot; murmured Jo .
&quot; What shall you do all your vacation ? &quot;
asked Amy , changing the subject , with tact .
&quot; I shall lie <unk> late , and do nothing , &quot; replied Meg , from the <unk> of the <unk> .
&quot; I &apos;ve been <unk> up early all winter , and had to spend my days working for other people ; so now I &apos;m going to rest and revel to my heart &apos;s content . &quot;
&quot; No , &quot; said Jo ; &quot; that <unk> way wouldn &apos;t suit me .
I &apos;ve laid in a heap of books , and I &apos;m going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple-tree , when I &apos;m not having <unk> &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say &apos; larks ! &apos; &quot;
implored Amy , as a return snub for the &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
&quot; I &apos;ll say &apos; <unk> , &apos; then , with Laurie ; that &apos;s proper and appropriate , since he &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t let us do any lessons , Beth , for a while , but play all the time , and rest , as the girls mean to , &quot; proposed Amy .
&quot; Well , I will , if mother doesn &apos;t mind .
I want to learn some new songs , and my children need fitting up for the summer ; they are dreadfully out of order , and really suffering for clothes . &quot;
&quot; May we , mother ? &quot;
asked Meg , turning to Mrs. March , who sat sewing , in what they called &quot; Marmee &apos;s corner . &quot;
&quot; You may try your experiment for a week , and see how you like it .
I think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play . &quot;
&quot; Oh , dear , no !
it will be delicious , I &apos;m sure , &quot; said Meg complacently .
&quot; I now propose a toast , as my &apos; friend and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &apos; says .
<unk> forever , and no <unk> ! &quot;
cried Jo , rising , glass in hand , as the lemonade went round .
They all drank it merrily , and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day .
Next morning , Meg did not appear till ten o &apos;clock ; her solitary breakfast did not taste nice , and the room seemed lonely and <unk> ; for Jo had not filled the vases , Beth had not <unk> , and Amy &apos;s books lay scattered about .
Nothing was neat and pleasant but &quot; Marmee &apos;s corner , &quot; which looked as usual ; and there Meg sat , to &quot; rest and read , &quot; which meant <unk> , and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary .
Jo spent the morning on the river , with Laurie , and the afternoon reading and crying over &quot; The <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; up in the apple-tree .
Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet , where her family <unk> ; but , getting tired before half done , she left her establishment topsy-turvy , and went to her music , rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash . Amy arranged her bower , put on her best white frock , smoothed her curls , and sat down to draw , under the <unk> , hoping some one would see and inquire who the young artist was .
As no one appeared but an inquisitive <unk> , who examined her work with interest , she went to walk , got caught in a shower , and came home <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : Amy sat down to draw &#93; At <unk> they compared notes , and all agreed that it had been a delightful , though unusually long day .
Meg , who went shopping in the afternoon , and got a &quot; sweet blue muslin , &quot; had discovered , after she had cut the <unk> off , that it wouldn &apos;t wash , which mishap made her <unk> cross .
Jo had burnt the skin off her nose boating , and got a <unk> headache by reading too long .
Beth was worried by the confusion of her closet , and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once ; and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock , for <unk> Brown &apos;s party was to be the next day ; and now , like <unk> <unk> , she had &quot; nothing to wear . &quot;
But these were mere trifles ; and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely .
She smiled , said nothing , and , with Hannah &apos;s help , did their neglected work , keeping home pleasant , and the domestic machinery running smoothly .
It was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the &quot; resting and <unk> &quot; process .
The days kept getting longer and longer ; the weather was unusually <unk> , and so were tempers ; an unsettled feeling possessed every one , and <unk> found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do .
As the <unk> of luxury , Meg put out some of her sewing , and then found time hang so <unk> that she fell to <unk> and spoiling her clothes , in her attempts to <unk> them up ?
la Moffat .
Jo read till her eyes gave out , and she was sick of books ; got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a quarrel with her , and so <unk> in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with Aunt March .
Beth got on pretty well , for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be _ all play , and no work _ , and fell back into her old ways now and then ; but something in the air affected her , and , more than once , her <unk> was much disturbed ; so much so , that , on one occasion , she actually shook poor dear Joanna , and told her she was &quot; a fright . &quot;
Amy <unk> worst of all , for her <unk> were small ; and when her sisters left her to amuse and care for herself , she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden .
She didn &apos;t like dolls , <unk> were childish , and one couldn &apos;t draw all the time ; <unk> didn &apos;t amount to much , neither did <unk> , unless very well <unk> .
&quot; If one could have a fine house , full of nice girls , or go travelling , the summer would be delightful ; but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a <unk> , &quot; complained Miss <unk> , after several days devoted to pleasure , fretting , and _ <unk> _ .
No one would own that they were tired of the experiment ; but , by <unk> night , each <unk> to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done .
<unk> to <unk> the lesson more deeply , Mrs. March , who had a good deal of humor , resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner ; so she gave Hannah a holiday , and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play <unk> .
When they got up on Saturday morning , there was no fire in the kitchen , no breakfast in the dining-room , and no mother anywhere to be seen .
&quot; Mercy on us !
what _ has _ happened ? &quot;
cried Jo , staring about her in dismay .
Meg ran upstairs , and soon came back again , looking relieved , but rather bewildered , and a little ashamed .
&quot; Mother isn &apos;t sick , only very tired , and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day , and let us do the best we can .
It &apos;s a very queer thing for her to do , she doesn &apos;t act a bit like herself ; but she says it has been a hard week for her , so we mustn &apos;t <unk> , but take care of ourselves . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s easy enough , and I like the idea ; I &apos;m aching for something to <unk> is , some new amusement , you know , &quot; added Jo quickly .
In fact it _ was _ an immense relief to them all to have a little work , and they took hold with a will , but soon realized the truth of Hannah &apos;s saying , &quot; <unk> ain &apos;t no joke . &quot;
There was plenty of food in the <unk> , and , while Beth and Amy set the table , Meg and Jo got breakfast , wondering , as they did so , why servants ever talked about hard work .
&quot; I shall take some up to mother , though she said we were not to think of her , for she &apos;d take care of herself , &quot; said Meg , who presided , and felt quite matronly behind the teapot .
So a <unk> was fitted out before any one began , and taken up , with the cook &apos;s compliments .
The boiled tea was very bitter , the <unk> scorched , and the <unk> <unk> with <unk> ; but Mrs. March received her <unk> with thanks , and laughed heartily over it after Jo was gone .
&quot; Poor little souls , they will have a hard time , I &apos;m afraid ; but they won &apos;t suffer , and it will do them good , &quot; she said , producing the more <unk> <unk> with which she had provided herself , and <unk> of the bad breakfast , so that their feelings might not be hurt , --a motherly little <unk> , for which they were grateful .
Many were the <unk> below , and great the <unk> of the head cook at her failures .
&quot; Never mind , I &apos;ll get the dinner , and be servant ; you be mistress , keep your hands nice , see company , and give orders , &quot; said Jo , who knew still less than Meg about <unk> affairs .
This obliging offer was gladly accepted ; and Margaret retired to the parlor , which she hastily put in order by whisking the <unk> under the sofa , and shutting the <unk> , to save the trouble of <unk> .
Jo , with perfect faith in her own powers , and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel , immediately put a note in the office , inviting Laurie to dinner .
&quot; You &apos;d better see what you have got before you think of having company , &quot; said Meg , when informed of the hospitable but rash act .
&quot; Oh , there &apos;s <unk> beef and plenty of potatoes ; and I shall get some asparagus , and a lobster , &apos; for a relish , &apos; as Hannah says .
We &apos;ll have <unk> , and make a salad .
I don &apos;t know how , but the book tells .
I &apos;ll have blanc-mange and strawberries for <unk> ; and coffee , too , if you want to be elegant . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t try too many messes , Jo , for you can &apos;t make anything but gingerbread and <unk> <unk> , fit to eat .
I wash my hands of the dinner-party ; and , since you have asked Laurie on your own <unk> , you may just take care of him . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want you to do anything but be civil to him , and help to the pudding .
You &apos;ll give me your advice if I get in a muddle , won &apos;t you ? &quot;
asked Jo , rather hurt .
&quot; Yes ; but I don &apos;t know much , except about bread , and a few trifles .
You had better ask mother &apos;s leave before you order anything , &quot; returned Meg prudently .
&quot; Of course I shall ; I &apos;m not a fool , &quot; and Jo went off in a <unk> at the doubts expressed of her powers .
&quot; Get what you like , and don &apos;t disturb me ; I &apos;m going out to dinner , and can &apos;t worry about things at home , &quot; said Mrs. March , when Jo spoke to her .
&quot; I never enjoyed housekeeping , and I &apos;m going to take a vacation to-day , and read , write , go visiting , and amuse myself . &quot;
The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably , and reading , early in the morning , made Jo feel as if some natural <unk> had occurred , for an <unk> , an earthquake , or a <unk> <unk> would hardly have seemed stranger .
&quot; Everything is out of sorts , somehow , &quot; she said to herself , going down stairs .
&quot; There &apos;s Beth crying ; that &apos;s a sure sign that something is wrong with this family .
If Amy is <unk> , I &apos;ll shake her . &quot;
Feeling very much out of sorts herself , Jo hurried into the parlor to find Beth sobbing over Pip , the <unk> , who lay dead in the cage , with his little <unk> <unk> <unk> , as if imploring the food for want of which he had died .
&quot; It &apos;s all my <unk> forgot <unk> isn &apos;t a <unk> or a drop left .
O Pip !
O Pip !
how could I be so cruel to you ? &quot;
cried Beth , taking the poor thing in her hands , and trying to restore him .
&#91; Illustration : O Pip !
O Pip ! &#93;
Jo peeped into his <unk> eye , felt his little heart , and finding him stiff and cold , shook her head , and offered her <unk> for a <unk> .
&quot; Put him in the <unk> , and maybe he will get warm and <unk> , &quot; said Amy hopefully .
&quot; He &apos;s been <unk> , and he sha &apos;n&apos;t be <unk> , now he &apos;s dead .
I &apos;ll make him a shroud , and he shall be buried in the garden ; and I &apos;ll never have another bird , never , my Pip !
for I am too bad to own one , &quot; murmured Beth , sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands .
&quot; The funeral shall be this afternoon , and we will all go .
Now , don &apos;t cry , Bethy ; it &apos;s a pity , but nothing goes right this week , and Pip has had the worst of the experiment .
Make the shroud , and lay him in my box ; and , after the dinner-party , we &apos;ll have a nice little funeral , &quot; said Jo , beginning to feel as if she had <unk> a good deal .
Leaving the others to console Beth , she departed to the kitchen , which was in a most <unk> state of confusion .
Putting on a big apron , she fell to work , and got the dishes piled up ready for washing , when she discovered that the fire was out .
&quot; Here &apos;s a sweet prospect ! &quot;
muttered Jo , slamming the <unk> open , and poking <unk> among the <unk> .
Having <unk> the fire , she thought she would go to market while the water <unk> .
The walk revived her spirits ; and , flattering herself that she had made good <unk> , she <unk> home again , after buying a very young lobster , some very old asparagus , and two boxes of <unk> strawberries .
By the time she got cleared up , the dinner arrived , and the stove was <unk> .
Hannah had left a <unk> of bread to rise , Meg had worked it up early , set it on the hearth for a second rising , and forgotten it .
Meg was <unk> Sallie Gardiner in the parlor , when the door flew open , and a <unk> , <unk> , flushed , and dishevelled figure appeared , demanding <unk> , -- &quot; I say , isn &apos;t bread &apos; <unk> &apos; enough when it runs over the <unk> ? &quot;
Sallie began to laugh ; but Meg nodded , and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go , which caused the <unk> to <unk> , and put the sour bread into the <unk> without further delay .
Mrs. March went out , after peeping here and there to see how matters went , also saying a word of comfort to Beth , who sat making a <unk> , while the dear departed lay in state in the <unk> .
A strange sense of <unk> fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner ; and despair seized them , when , a few minutes later , Miss Crocker appeared , and said she &apos;d come to dinner .
Now , this lady was a thin , yellow spinster , with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes , who saw everything , and <unk> about all she saw .
They disliked her , but had been taught to be kind to her , simply because she was old and poor , and had few friends .
So Meg gave her the easy-chair , and tried to entertain her , while she asked questions , criticised everything , and told stories of the people whom she knew .
<unk> cannot describe the <unk> , experiences , and exertions which Jo <unk> that morning ; and the dinner she served up became a standing joke .
<unk> to ask any more advice , she did her best alone , and discovered that something more than energy and good-will is necessary to make a cook .
She boiled the asparagus for an hour , and was grieved to find the heads <unk> off and the <unk> harder than ever .
The bread burnt black ; for the <unk> so aggravated her , that she let everything else go till she had <unk> herself that she could not make it fit to eat .
The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her , but she <unk> and poked , till it was <unk> , and its <unk> <unk> concealed in a grove of <unk> .
The potatoes had to be hurried , not to keep the asparagus waiting , and were not done at last .
The blanc-mange was <unk> , and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked , having been skilfully &quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Well , they can eat beef , and bread and butter , if they are hungry ; only it &apos;s <unk> to have to spend your whole morning for nothing , &quot; thought Jo , as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual , and stood , hot , tired , and <unk> , surveying the feast spread for Laurie , accustomed to all sorts of elegance , and Miss Crocker , whose curious eyes would mark all failures , and whose <unk> tongue would report them far and wide .
Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table , as one thing after another was tasted and left ; while Amy <unk> , Meg looked distressed , Miss Crocker <unk> up her lips , and Laurie talked and laughed with all his might , to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene .
Jo &apos;s one strong point was the fruit , for she had <unk> it well , and had a <unk> of rich cream to eat with it .
Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle , and she drew a long breath , as the pretty glass plates went round , and every one looked graciously at the little rosy <unk> floating in a sea of cream .
Miss Crocker tasted first , made a wry face , and drank some water hastily .
Jo , who had refused , thinking there might not be enough , for they <unk> sadly after the picking over , glanced at Laurie , but he was eating away manfully , though there was a slight <unk> about his mouth , and he kept his eye fixed on his plate .
Amy , who was fond of delicate fare , took a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , hid her face in her napkin , and left the table precipitately .
&#91; Illustration : Miss Crocker made a wry face &#93; &quot; Oh , what is it ? &quot;
exclaimed Jo trembling .
&quot; <unk> instead of sugar , and the cream is sour , &quot; replied Meg , with a tragic gesture .
Jo uttered a groan , and fell back in her chair ; remembering that she had given a last hasty <unk> to the <unk> out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table , and had neglected to put the milk in the <unk> .
She turned scarlet , and was on the <unk> of crying , when she met Laurie &apos;s eyes , which _ would _ look merry in spite of his heroic efforts ; the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her , and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks .
So did every one else , even &quot; <unk> , &quot; as the girls called the old lady ; and the unfortunate dinner ended gayly , with bread and butter , <unk> and fun .
&quot; I haven &apos;t strength of mind enough to clear up now , so we will sober ourselves with a funeral , &quot; said Jo , as they rose ; and Miss Crocker made ready to go , being eager to tell the new story at another friend &apos;s <unk> .
They did sober themselves , for Beth &apos;s sake ; Laurie <unk> a grave under the ferns in the grove , little Pip was laid in , with many tears , by his tender-hearted mistress , and covered with <unk> , while a wreath of <unk> and <unk> was hung on the stone which bore his <unk> , composed by Jo , while she <unk> with the dinner : -- &quot; Here lies Pip March , Who died the <unk> of June ; <unk> and <unk> sore , And not forgotten soon . &quot;
At the conclusion of the ceremonies , Beth retired to her room , overcome with emotion and lobster ; but there was no place of repose , for the <unk> were not made , and she found her grief much <unk> by <unk> up pillows and putting things in order .
Meg helped Jo clear away the remains of the feast , which took half the afternoon , and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper .
Laurie took Amy to drive , which was a <unk> of charity , for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper .
Mrs. March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon ; and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment .
Before the <unk> could rest , several people called , and there was a <unk> to get ready to see them ; then tea must be got , errands done ; and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected till the last minute .
As twilight fell , <unk> and still , one by one they gathered in the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully , and each groaned or sighed as she sat down , as if tired or troubled .
&quot; What a dreadful day this has been ! &quot;
begun Jo , usually the first to speak .
&quot; It has seemed <unk> than usual , but _ so _ uncomfortable , &quot; said Meg .
&quot; Not a bit like home , &quot; added Amy .
&quot; It can &apos;t seem so without Marmee and little Pip , &quot; sighed Beth , glancing , with full eyes , at the empty cage above her head .
&quot; Here &apos;s mother , dear , and you shall have another bird to-morrow , if you want it . &quot;
As she spoke , Mrs. March came and took her place among them , looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs .
&quot; Are you satisfied with your experiment , girls , or do you want another week of it ? &quot;
she asked , as Beth nestled up to her , and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces , as flowers turn toward the sun .
&quot; I don &apos;t ! &quot;
cried Jo decidedly .
&quot; Nor I , &quot; echoed the others .
&quot; You think , then , that it is better to have a few duties , and live a little for others , do you ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> and <unk> doesn &apos;t pay , &quot; observed Jo , shaking her head .
&quot; I &apos;m tired of it , and mean to go to work at something right off . &quot;
&quot; Suppose you learn plain cooking ; that &apos;s a useful accomplishment , which no woman should be without , &quot; said Mrs. March , laughing <unk> at the recollection of Jo &apos;s dinner-party ; for she had met Miss Crocker , and heard her account of it .
&quot; Mother , did you go away and let everything be , just to see how we &apos;d get on ? &quot;
cried Meg , who had had suspicions all day .
&quot; Yes ; I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully .
While Hannah and I did your work , you got on pretty well , though I don &apos;t think you were very happy or amiable ; so I thought , as a little lesson , I would show you what happens when every one thinks only of herself .
Don &apos;t you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another , to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes , and to bear and <unk> , that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all ? &quot;
&quot; We do , mother , we do ! &quot;
cried the girls .
&quot; Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again ; for though they seem heavy sometimes , they are good for us , and <unk> as we learn to carry them .
<unk> is wholesome , and there is plenty for every one ; it keeps us from _ <unk> _ and mischief , is good for health and spirits , and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ll work like bees , and love it too ; see if we don &apos;t ! &quot;
said Jo .
&quot; I &apos;ll learn plain cooking for my holiday task ; and the next dinner-party I have shall be a success . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll make the set of <unk> for father , instead of letting you do it , Marmee .
I can and I will , though I &apos;m not fond of sewing ; that will be better than fussing over my own things , which are plenty nice enough as they are , &quot; said Meg .
&quot; I &apos;ll do my lessons every day , and not spend so much time with my music and dolls .
I am a stupid thing , and ought to be studying , not playing , &quot; was Beth &apos;s resolution ; while Amy followed their example by heroically declaring , &quot; I shall learn to make button-holes , and attend to my parts of speech . &quot;
&quot; Very good !
then I am quite satisfied with the experiment , and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it ; only don &apos;t go to the other <unk> , and <unk> like <unk> .
Have regular hours for work and play ; make each day both useful and pleasant , and prove that you understand the worth of time by <unk> it well .
Then youth will be delightful , old age will bring few regrets , and life become a beautiful success , in spite of poverty . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ll remember , mother ! &quot;
and they did .
&#91; Illustration : We &apos;ll work like bees &#93; <unk> .
<unk> LAURENCE .
&#91; Illustration : Beth was post-mistress &#93; Beth was post-mistress , for , being most at home , she could attend to it regularly , and dearly liked the daily task of <unk> the little door and distributing the mail .
One <unk> day she came in with her hands full , and went about the house leaving letters and <unk> , like the penny post .
&quot; Here &apos;s your posy , mother !
Laurie never forgets that , &quot; she said , putting the fresh <unk> in the vase that stood in &quot; Marmee &apos;s corner , &quot; and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy .
&quot; Miss Meg March , one letter and a glove , &quot; continued Beth , <unk> the articles to her sister , who sat near her mother , <unk> <unk> .
&quot; Why , I left a pair over there , and here is only one , &quot; said Meg , looking at the gray cotton glove .
&quot; Didn &apos;t you drop the other in the garden ? &quot;
&quot; No , I &apos;m sure I didn &apos;t ; for there was only one in the office . &quot;
&quot; I hate to have odd gloves !
Never mind , the other may be found .
My letter is only a <unk> of the German song I wanted ; I think Mr. Brooke did it , for this isn &apos;t Laurie &apos;s writing . &quot;
Mrs. March glanced at Meg , who was looking very pretty in her <unk> <unk> , with the little curls blowing about her forehead , and very womanly , as she sat sewing at her little <unk> , full of tidy white <unk> ; so unconscious of the thought in her mother &apos;s mind as she sewed and sung , while her fingers flew , and her thoughts were <unk> with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her <unk> , that Mrs. March smiled , and was satisfied .
&quot; Two letters for <unk> Jo , a book , and a funny old hat , which covered the whole post-office , stuck outside , &quot; said Beth , laughing , as she went into the study , where Jo sat writing .
&quot; What a sly fellow Laurie is !
I said I wished bigger hats were the fashion , because I burn my face every hot day .
He said , &apos; Why mind the fashion ?
<unk> a big hat , and be comfortable ! &apos;
I said I would if I had one , and he has sent me this , to try me .
I &apos;ll wear it , for fun , and show him I _ don &apos;t _ care for the fashion ; &quot; and , hanging the antique <unk> on a <unk> of Plato , Jo read her letters .
One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill , for it said to her , -- &quot; MY DEAR : &quot; I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch your efforts to control your temper .
You say nothing about your trials , failures , or successes , and think , perhaps , that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask , if I may trust the well-worn cover of your guide-book .
_ I _ , too , have seen them all , and heartily believe in the <unk> of your resolution , since it begins to bear fruit .
Go on , dear , patiently and bravely , and always believe that no one <unk> more tenderly with you than your loving &quot; MOTHER . &quot;
&quot; That does me good !
that &apos;s worth <unk> of money and <unk> of praise .
O Marmee , I do try !
I will keep on trying , and not get tired , since I have you to help me . &quot;
<unk> her head on her arms , Jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears , for she _ had _ thought that no one saw and <unk> her efforts to be good ; and this <unk> was <unk> precious , <unk> encouraging , because unexpected , and from the person whose <unk> she most valued .
Feeling stronger than ever to meet and <unk> her <unk> , she <unk> the note inside her frock , as a shield and a <unk> , lest she be taken <unk> , and proceeded to open her other letter , quite ready for either good or bad news .
In a big , dashing hand , Laurie wrote , -- &quot; DEAR JO , What <unk> !
Some English girls and boys are coming to see me to-morrow and I want to have a jolly time .
If it &apos;s fine , I &apos;m going to <unk> my tent in <unk> , and row up the whole <unk> to lunch and croquet , <unk> a fire , make messes , <unk> fashion , and all sorts of larks .
They are nice people , and like such things .
Brooke will go , to keep us boys steady , and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for the girls .
I want you all to come ; can &apos;t let Beth off , at any price , and nobody shall worry her .
Don &apos;t bother about <unk> , --I &apos;ll see to that , and everything else , <unk> do come , there &apos;s a good fellow !
&quot; In a tearing hurry , Yours ever , LAURIE . &quot;
&quot; Here &apos;s <unk> ! &quot;
cried Jo , flying in to tell the news to Meg .
&quot; Of course we can go , mother ?
it will be such a help to Laurie , for I can row , and Meg see to the lunch , and the children be useful in some way . &quot;
&quot; I hope the Vaughns are not fine , grown-up people .
Do you know anything about them , Jo ? &quot;
asked Meg .
&quot; Only that there are four of them .
Kate is older than you , Fred and Frank ( twins ) about my age , and a little girl ( Grace ) , who is nine or ten .
Laurie knew them abroad , and liked the boys ; I fancied , from the way he <unk> up his mouth in speaking of her , that he didn &apos;t admire Kate much . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m so glad my French print is <unk> ; it &apos;s just the thing , and so becoming ! &quot;
observed Meg complacently .
&quot; Have you anything <unk> , Jo ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> and gray boating suit , good enough for me .
I shall row and tramp about , so I don &apos;t want any <unk> to think of .
You &apos;ll come , Bethy ? &quot;
&quot; If you won &apos;t let any of the boys talk to me . &quot;
&quot; Not a boy ! &quot;
&quot; I like to please Laurie ; and I &apos;m not afraid of Mr. Brooke , he is so kind ; but I don &apos;t want to play , or sing , or say anything .
I &apos;ll work hard , and not trouble any one ; and you &apos;ll take care of me , Jo , so I &apos;ll go . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s my good girl ; you do try to fight off your shyness , and I love you for it .
<unk> faults isn &apos;t easy , as I know ; and a cheery word kind of gives a lift .
Thank you , mother , &quot; and Jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss , more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back the rosy <unk> of her youth .
&quot; I had a box of chocolate drops , and the picture I wanted to copy , &quot; said Amy , showing her mail .
&quot; And I got a note from Mr. Laurence , asking me to come over and play to him to-night , before the lamps are lighted , and I shall go , &quot; added Beth , whose friendship with the old gentleman <unk> finely .
&quot; Now let &apos;s fly round , and do double duty to-day , so that we can play to-morrow with free minds , &quot; said Jo , preparing to <unk> her pen with a broom .
When the sun peeped into the girls &apos; room early next morning , to promise them a fine day , he saw a comical sight .
Each had made such preparation for the f ? te as seemed necessary and proper .
Meg had an extra row of little <unk> across her forehead , Jo had <unk> <unk> her afflicted face with cold cream , Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation , and Amy had capped the climax by putting a clothes-pin on her nose , to <unk> the <unk> feature .
It was one of the kind <unk> use to hold the paper on their <unk> , therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose to which it was now put .
This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun , for he burst out with such <unk> that Jo woke up , and roused all her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy &apos;s ornament .
&#91; Illustration : Amy capped the climax by putting a clothes-pin on her nose &#93; <unk> and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party , and soon a lively bustle began in both houses .
Beth , who was ready first , kept <unk> what went on next door , and <unk> her sisters &apos; <unk> by frequent <unk> from the window .
&quot; There goes the man with the tent !
I see Mrs. <unk> doing up the lunch in a <unk> and a great basket .
Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the sky , and the weathercock ; I wish he would go , too .
There &apos;s Laurie , looking like a <unk> , <unk> boy !
Oh , mercy me !
here &apos;s a carriage full of <unk> tall lady , a little girl , and two dreadful boys .
One is lame ; poor thing , he &apos;s got a crutch .
Laurie didn &apos;t tell us that .
Be quick , girls !
it &apos;s getting late .
Why , there is Ned Moffat , I do declare .
Look , Meg , isn &apos;t that the man who bowed to you one day , when we were shopping ? &quot;
&quot; So it is .
How queer that he should come .
I thought he was at the <unk> .
There is Sallie ; I &apos;m glad she got back in time .
Am I all right , Jo ? &quot;
cried Meg , in a flutter .
&quot; A regular <unk> .
Hold up your dress and put your hat straight ; it looks sentimental <unk> that way , and will fly off at the first <unk> .
Now , then , come on ! &quot;
&quot; O Jo , you are not going to wear that awful hat ?
It &apos;s too absurd !
You shall _ not _ make a guy of yourself , &quot; <unk> Meg , as Jo tied down , with a red ribbon , the <unk> , old-fashioned <unk> Laurie had sent for a joke .
&quot; I just will , though , for it &apos;s capital , --so shady , light , and big .
It will make fun ; and I don &apos;t mind being a guy if I &apos;m comfortable . &quot;
With that Jo marched straight away , and the rest followed , --a bright little band of sisters , all looking their best , in summer suits , with happy faces under the <unk> <unk> .
Laurie ran to meet , and present them to his friends , in the most cordial manner .
The lawn was the <unk> , and for several minutes a lively scene was <unk> there .
Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate , though twenty , was dressed with a <unk> which American girls would do well to imitate ; and she was much flattered by Mr. Ned &apos;s assurances that he came especially to see her .
Jo understood why Laurie &quot; <unk> up his mouth &quot; when speaking of Kate , for that young lady had a <unk> <unk> air , which contrasted strongly with the free and easy <unk> of the other girls .
Beth took an observation of the new boys , and decided that the lame one was not &quot; dreadful , &quot; but gentle and feeble , and she would be kind to him on that account .
Amy found Grace a <unk> , merry little person ; and after staring <unk> at one another for a few minutes , they suddenly became very good friends .
<unk> , lunch , and croquet <unk> having been sent on beforehand , the party was soon <unk> , and the two boats pushed off together , leaving Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore .
Laurie and Jo rowed one boat ; Mr. Brooke and Ned the other ; while Fred Vaughn , the riotous <unk> , did his best to upset both by <unk> about in a <unk> like a disturbed <unk> .
Jo &apos;s funny hat deserved a vote of thanks , for it was of general <unk> ; it broke the ice in the beginning , by producing a laugh ; it created quite a refreshing <unk> , flapping to and fro , as she rowed , and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party , if a shower came up , she said .
Kate looked rather amazed at Jo &apos;s <unk> , especially as she exclaimed &quot; Christopher Columbus ! &quot;
when she lost her oar ; and Laurie said , &quot; My dear fellow , did I hurt you ? &quot;
when he tripped over her feet in taking his place .
But after putting up her glass to examine the queer girl several times , Miss Kate decided that she was &quot; odd , but rather clever , &quot; and smiled upon her from <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : Mr. Laurence waving his hat &#93; Meg , in the other boat , was delightfully <unk> , face to face with the <unk> , who both admired the prospect , and <unk> their oars with uncommon &quot; skill and <unk> . &quot;
Mr. Brooke was a grave , silent young man , with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice .
Meg liked his quiet manners , and considered him a walking <unk> ? <unk> of useful knowledge .
He never talked to her much ; but he looked at her a good deal , and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion .
Ned , being in college , of course put on all the airs which <unk> think it their <unk> duty to <unk> ; he was not very wise , but very good-natured , and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic .
Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white <unk> ?
dress <unk> , and <unk> with the <unk> Fred , who kept Beth in constant <unk> by his pranks .
It was not far to <unk> ; but the tent was <unk> and the <unk> down by the time they arrived .
A pleasant green field , with three <unk> <unk> in the middle , and a smooth <unk> of turf for croquet .
&quot; Welcome to Camp Laurence ! &quot;
said the young host , as they <unk> , with <unk> of delight .
&quot; Brooke is <unk> ; I am <unk> ; the other fellows are <unk> ; and you , ladies , are company .
The tent is for your especial benefit , and that <unk> is your drawing-room ; this is the <unk> , and the third is the <unk> .
Now , let &apos;s have a game before it gets hot , and then we &apos;ll see about dinner . &quot;
Frank , Beth , Amy , and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight .
Mr. Brooke chose Meg , Kate , and Fred ; Laurie took Sallie , Jo , and Ned .
The <unk> played well ; but the Americans played better , and <unk> every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of &apos; <unk> inspired them .
Jo and Fred had several skirmishes , and once <unk> escaped high words .
Jo was through the last wicket , and had missed the stroke , which failure ruffled her a good deal .
Fred was close behind her , and his turn came before hers ; he gave a stroke , his ball hit the wicket , and stopped an inch on the wrong side .
No one was very near ; and running up to examine , he gave it a sly <unk> with his <unk> , which put it just an inch on the right side .
&quot; I &apos;m through !
Now , Miss Jo , I &apos;ll settle you , and get in first , &quot; cried the young gentleman , <unk> his <unk> for another blow .
&#91; Illustration : Now , Miss Jo , I &apos;ll settle you &#93; &quot; You pushed it ; I saw you ; it &apos;s my turn now , &quot; said Jo sharply .
&quot; Upon my word , I didn &apos;t move it ; it rolled a bit , perhaps , but that is allowed ; so stand off , please , and let me have a go at the stake . &quot;
&quot; We don &apos;t cheat in America , but you can , if you choose , &quot; said Jo angrily .
&quot; Yankees are a deal the most <unk> , everybody knows .
There you go ! &quot;
returned Fred , <unk> her ball far away .
Jo opened her lips to say something rude , but checked herself in time , colored up to her forehead , and stood a minute , hammering down a wicket with all her might , while Fred hit the stake , and declared himself out with much <unk> .
She went off to get her ball , and was a long time finding it , among the <unk> ; but she came back , looking cool and quiet , and waited her turn patiently .
It took several <unk> to <unk> the place she had lost ; and , when she got there , the other side had nearly won , for Kate &apos;s ball was the last but one , and lay near the stake .
&quot; By George , it &apos;s all up with us !
Good-by , Kate .
Miss Jo <unk> me one , so you are finished , &quot; cried Fred excitedly , as they all drew near to see the finish .
&quot; Yankees have a <unk> of being generous to their enemies , &quot; said Jo , with a look that made the lad <unk> , &quot; especially when they beat them , &quot; she added , as , leaving Kate &apos;s ball <unk> , she won the game by a clever stroke .
Laurie threw up his hat ; then remembered that it wouldn &apos;t do to exult over the <unk> of his guests , and stopped in the middle of a cheer to whisper to his friend , -- &quot; Good for you , Jo !
He did cheat , I saw him ; we can &apos;t tell him so , but he won &apos;t do it again , take my word for it . &quot;
Meg drew her aside , under pretence of <unk> up a loose <unk> , and said approvingly , -- &quot; It was dreadfully provoking ; but you kept your temper , and I &apos;m so glad , Jo . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t praise me , Meg , for I could box his ears this minute .
I should certainly have boiled over if I hadn &apos;t stayed among the <unk> till I got my <unk> under enough to hold my tongue .
It &apos;s simmering now , so I hope he &apos;ll keep out of my way , &quot; returned Jo , <unk> her lips , as she glowered at Fred from under her big hat .
&quot; Time for lunch , &quot; said Mr. Brooke , looking at his watch .
&quot; <unk> , will you make the fire and get water , while Miss March , Miss Sallie , and I spread the table ?
Who can make good coffee ? &quot;
&quot; Jo can , &quot; said Meg , glad to <unk> her sister .
So Jo , feeling that her late lessons in <unk> were to do her honor , went to <unk> over the coffee-pot , while the children collected dry sticks , and the boys made a fire , and got water from a spring near by .
Miss Kate sketched , and Frank talked to Beth , who was making little <unk> of <unk> <unk> to serve as plates .
The <unk> and his <unk> soon spread the <unk> with an inviting array of <unk> and <unk> , prettily <unk> with green leaves .
Jo announced that the coffee was ready , and every one settled themselves to a hearty <unk> ; for youth is seldom <unk> , and exercise <unk> wholesome <unk> .
A very merry lunch it was ; for everything seemed fresh and funny , and frequent <unk> of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by .
There was a pleasing <unk> in the table , which produced many <unk> to cups and plates ; <unk> dropped into the milk , little black <unk> <unk> of the <unk> without being invited , and <unk> <unk> swung down from the tree , to see what was going on .
Three <unk> children peeped over the fence , and an <unk> dog <unk> at them from the other side of the river with all his might and <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : &quot; A very merry lunch it was . &quot;
--Page <unk> . &#93;
&quot; There &apos;s salt here , if you prefer it , &quot; said Laurie , as he handed Jo a <unk> of <unk> .
&quot; Thank you , I prefer spiders , &quot; she replied , <unk> up two <unk> little ones who had gone to a <unk> death .
&quot; How dare you remind me of that horrid dinner-party , when yours is so nice in every way ? &quot;
added Jo , as they both laughed , and ate out of one plate , the china having run short .
&quot; I had an uncommonly good time that day , and haven &apos;t got over it yet .
This is no credit to me , you know ; I don &apos;t do anything ; it &apos;s you and Meg and Brooke who make it go , and I &apos;m no end obliged to you .
What shall we do when we can &apos;t eat any more ? &quot;
asked Laurie , feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was over .
&quot; Have games , till it &apos;s <unk> .
I brought &apos; <unk> , &apos; and I dare say Miss Kate knows something new and nice .
Go and ask her ; she &apos;s company , and you ought to stay with her more . &quot;
&quot; Aren &apos;t you company too ?
I thought she &apos;d suit Brooke ; but he keeps talking to Meg , and Kate just <unk> at them through that ridiculous glass of hers .
I &apos;m going , so you needn &apos;t try to preach propriety , for you can &apos;t do it , Jo . &quot;
Miss Kate did know several new games ; and as the girls would not , and the boys could not , eat any more , they all <unk> to the drawing-room to play &quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; One person begins a story , any nonsense you like , and tells as long as he <unk> , only taking care to stop short at some exciting point , when the next takes it up and does the same .
It &apos;s very funny when well done , and makes a perfect <unk> of tragical comical stuff to laugh over .
Please start it , Mr. Brooke , &quot; said Kate , with a commanding air , which surprised Meg , who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman .
<unk> on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies , Mr. Brooke obediently began the story , with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river .
&quot; Once on a time , a knight went out into the world to <unk> his fortune , for he had nothing but his sword and his shield .
He travelled a long while , nearly <unk> years , and had a hard time of it , till he came to the <unk> of a good old king , who had offered a reward to any one who would <unk> and train a fine but unbroken colt , of which he was very fond .
The knight agreed to try , and got on slowly but surely ; for the colt was a gallant fellow , and soon learned to love his new master , though he was <unk> and wild .
Every day , when he gave his lessons to this pet of the king &apos;s , the knight rode him through the city ; and , as he rode , he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face , which he had seen many times in his dreams , but never found .
One day , as he went prancing down a quiet street , he saw at the window of a <unk> castle the lovely face .
He was delighted , inquired who lived in this old castle , and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell , and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty .
The knight wished <unk> that he could free them ; but he was poor , and could only go by each day , watching for the sweet face , and longing to see it out in the sunshine .
At last , he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them .
He went and knocked ; the great door flew open , and he <unk> &quot; &#91; Illustration : He went prancing down a quiet street &#93; &quot; A <unk> lovely lady , who exclaimed , with a cry of rapture , &apos; At last !
at last ! &apos; &quot;
continued Kate , who had read French novels , and admired the style .
&quot; &apos; &apos; <unk> she ! &apos;
cried Count <unk> , and fell at her feet in an <unk> of joy .
<unk> , rise ! &apos;
she said , <unk> a hand of marble <unk> .
<unk> !
till you tell me how I may rescue you , &apos; <unk> the knight , still kneeling .
<unk> , my cruel fate <unk> me to remain here till my <unk> is <unk> . &apos;
<unk> is the villain ? &apos;
<unk> the <unk> salon .
Go , brave heart , and save me from despair . &apos;
&apos;I obey , and return <unk> or dead ! &apos;
With these thrilling words he rushed away , and <unk> open the door of the <unk> salon , was about to enter , when he <unk> &quot; &#91; Illustration : &quot; Oh , rise , &quot; she said &#93; &quot; A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon , which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him , &quot; said Ned .
&quot; <unk> Sir What <unk> recovered himself , <unk> the <unk> out of the window , and turned to join the lady , <unk> , but with a <unk> on his brow ; found the door locked , tore up the curtains , made a <unk> ladder , got <unk> down when the ladder broke , and he went head first into the <unk> , sixty feet below .
Could <unk> like a <unk> , <unk> round the castle till he came to a little door <unk> by two stout fellows ; knocked their heads together till they <unk> like a couple of nuts , then , by a trifling <unk> of his <unk> strength , he smashed in the door , went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick , <unk> as big as your fist , and spiders that would frighten you into <unk> , Miss March .
At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and <unk> his <unk> &quot; &#91; Illustration : A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon &#93; &quot; A tall figure , all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand , &quot; went on Meg .
&quot; It beckoned , <unk> noiselessly before him down a <unk> as dark and cold as any tomb .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> stood on either side , a dead silence reigned , the lamp <unk> blue , and the <unk> figure ever and <unk> turned its face toward him , showing the <unk> of awful eyes through its white veil .
They reached a curtained door , behind which sounded lovely music ; he <unk> forward to enter , but the <unk> plucked him back , and waved <unk> before him a-- &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; said Jo , in a <unk> tone , which convulsed the audience .
&quot; &apos; <unk> , &apos; said the knight <unk> , as he took a pinch , and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off .
<unk> !
ha ! &apos;
laughed the ghost ; and having peeped through the <unk> at the princesses spinning away for dear life , the evil spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin box , where there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads , like <unk> , who all rose and began <unk> &quot; &#91; Illustration : He sneezed &#93; &quot; <unk> a <unk> , &quot; cut in Fred , as Jo paused for breath ; &quot; and , as they danced , the <unk> old castle turned to a <unk> in full sail .
<unk> with the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> hard a <unk> , and man the <unk> ! &apos;
<unk> the captain , as a Portuguese <unk> <unk> in sight , with a <unk> black as ink flying from her <unk> .
<unk> in and win , my <unk> ! &apos;
says the captain ; and a tremendous fight begun .
Of course the British beat ; they always do . &quot;
&quot; No , they don &apos;t ! &quot;
cried Jo , aside .
&quot; Having taken the <unk> captain prisoner , sailed slap over the <unk> , whose <unk> were piled with dead , and whose <unk> ran blood , for the order had been &apos; <unk> , and die hard ! &apos;
<unk> &apos;s mate , take a <unk> of the <unk> sheet , and start this villain if he don &apos;t confess his sins double quick , &apos; said the British captain .
The Portuguese held his tongue like a <unk> , and walked the plank , while the jolly <unk> cheered like mad .
But the sly dog <unk> , came up under the <unk> , <unk> her , and down she went , with all sail set , &apos; To the bottom of the sea , sea , sea , &apos; <unk> &quot; &#91; Illustration : The Portuguese walked the plank &#93; &quot; Oh , gracious !
what _ shall _ I say ? &quot;
cried Sallie , as Fred ended his <unk> , in which he had jumbled together , pell-mell , <unk> phrases and facts , out of one of his favorite books .
&quot; Well they went to the bottom , and a nice <unk> welcomed them , but was much grieved on finding the box of <unk> knights , and kindly pickled them in <unk> , hoping to discover the mystery about them ; for , being a woman , she was curious .
By and by a <unk> came down , and the <unk> said , &apos; I &apos;ll give you this box of pearls if you can take it up ; &apos; for she wanted to restore the poor things to life , and couldn &apos;t <unk> the heavy load herself .
So the <unk> <unk> it up , and was much disappointed , on opening it , to find no pearls .
He left it in a great lonely field , where it was found by a-- &quot; &quot; Little <unk> , who kept a hundred fat geese in the field , &quot; said Amy , when Sallie &apos;s invention gave out .
&quot; The little girl was sorry for them , and asked an old woman what she should do to help them .
<unk> geese will tell you , they know everything , &apos; said the old woman .
So she asked what she should use for new heads , since the old ones were lost , and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and <unk> &quot; &quot; &apos; <unk> ! &apos; &quot;
continued Laurie promptly .
&quot; &apos; Just the thing , &apos; said the girl , and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden .
She put them on , the knights revived at once , thanked her , and went on their way rejoicing , never knowing the difference , for there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it .
The knight in whom I &apos;m interested went back to find the pretty face , and learned that the princesses had spun themselves free , and all gone to be married , but one .
He was in a great state of mind at that ; and <unk> the colt , who stood by him through thick and thin , rushed to the castle to see which was left .
<unk> over the hedge , he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden .
<unk> you give me a rose ? &apos;
said he .
<unk> must come and get it .
I can &apos;t come to you ; it isn &apos;t proper , &apos; said she , as sweet as honey .
He tried to climb over the hedge , but it seemed to grow higher and higher ; then he tried to <unk> through , but it grew <unk> and <unk> , and he was in despair .
So he patiently broke <unk> after <unk> , till he had made a little hole , through which he peeped , saying imploringly , &apos; Let me in !
let me in ! &apos;
But the pretty princess did not seem to understand , for she picked her roses quietly , and left him to fight his way in .
Whether he did or not , Frank will tell you . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Will you give me a rose ? &#93;
&quot; I can &apos;t ; I &apos;m not playing , I never do , &quot; said Frank , <unk> at the sentimental <unk> out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple .
Beth had disappeared behind Jo , and Grace was asleep .
&quot; So the poor knight is to be left <unk> in the hedge , is he ? &quot;
asked Mr. Brooke , still watching the river , and playing with the wild rose in his button-hole .
&quot; I guess the princess gave him a posy , and opened the gate , after a while , &quot; said Laurie , smiling to himself , as he threw <unk> at his tutor .
&quot; What a piece of nonsense we have made !
With practice we might do something quite clever .
Do you know &apos; Truth &apos; ? &quot;
asked Sallie , after they had laughed over their story .
&quot; I hope so , &quot; said Meg soberly .
&quot; The game , I mean ? &quot;
&quot; What is it ? &quot;
said Fred .
&quot; Why , you pile up your hands , choose a number , and draw out in turn , and the person who <unk> at the number has to answer truly any questions put by the rest .
It &apos;s great fun . &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s try it , &quot; said Jo , who liked new experiments .
Miss Kate and Mr. Brooke , Meg , and Ned declined , but Fred , Sallie , Jo , and Laurie piled and drew ; and the lot fell to Laurie .
&quot; Who are your heroes ? &quot;
asked Jo .
&quot; <unk> and Napoleon . &quot;
&quot; Which lady here do you think prettiest ? &quot;
said Sallie .
&quot; Margaret . &quot;
&quot; Which do you like best ? &quot;
from Fred .
&quot; Jo , of course . &quot;
&quot; What silly questions you ask ! &quot;
and Jo gave a <unk> shrug as the rest laughed at Laurie &apos;s <unk> tone .
&quot; Try again ; Truth isn &apos;t a bad game , &quot; said Fred .
&quot; It &apos;s a very good one for you , &quot; retorted Jo , in a low voice .
Her turn came next .
&quot; What is your greatest fault ? &quot;
asked Fred , by way of <unk> in her the virtue he <unk> himself .
&quot; A quick temper . &quot;
&quot; What do you most wish for ? &quot;
said Laurie .
&quot; A pair of <unk> , &quot; returned Jo , <unk> and <unk> his purpose .
&quot; Not a true answer ; you must say what you really do want most . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ; don &apos;t you wish you could give it to me , Laurie ? &quot;
and she slyly smiled in his disappointed face .
&quot; What virtues do you most admire in a man ? &quot;
asked Sallie .
&quot; <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Now my turn , &quot; said Fred , as his hand came last .
&quot; Let &apos;s give it to him , &quot; whispered Laurie to Jo , who nodded , and asked at once , -- &quot; Didn &apos;t you cheat at croquet ? &quot;
&quot; Well , yes , a little bit . &quot;
&quot; Good !
Didn &apos;t you take your story out of &apos; The <unk> ? &apos; &quot;
said Laurie .
&quot; Rather . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you think the English nation perfect in every respect ? &quot;
asked Sallie .
&quot; I should be ashamed of myself if I didn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s a true John <unk> .
Now , Miss Sallie , you shall have a chance without waiting to draw .
I &apos;ll <unk> up your feelings first , by asking if you don &apos;t think you are something of a flirt , &quot; said Laurie , as Jo nodded to Fred , as a sign that peace was declared .
&quot; You impertinent boy !
of course I &apos;m not , &quot; exclaimed Sallie , with an air that proved the contrary .
&quot; What do you hate most ? &quot;
asked Fred .
&quot; <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you like best ? &quot;
asked Jo .
&quot; <unk> and French gloves . &quot;
&quot; Well , _ I _ think Truth is a very silly play ; let &apos;s have a sensible game of <unk> , to refresh our minds , &quot; proposed Jo .
Ned , Frank , and the little girls joined in this , and , while it went on , the three elders sat apart , talking .
Miss Kate took out her sketch again , and Margaret watched her , while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass , with a book , which he did not read .
&quot; How beautifully you do it !
I wish I could draw , &quot; said Meg , with mingled admiration and regret in her voice .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you learn ?
I should think you had taste and talent for it , &quot; replied Miss Kate graciously .
&quot; I haven &apos;t time . &quot;
&quot; Your mamma <unk> other accomplishments , I fancy .
So did mine ; but I proved to her that I had talent , by taking a few lessons privately , and then she was quite willing I should go on .
Can &apos;t you do the same with your governess ? &quot;
&quot; I have none . &quot;
&quot; I forgot ; young ladies in America go to school more than with us .
Very fine <unk> they are , too , papa says .
You go to a private one , I suppose ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t go at all ; I am a governess myself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , indeed ! &quot;
said Miss Kate ; but she might as well have said , &quot; Dear me , how dreadful ! &quot;
for her tone <unk> it , and something in her face made Meg color , and wish she had not been so frank .
Mr. Brooke looked up , and said quickly , &quot; Young ladies in America love independence as much as their <unk> did , and are admired and respected for <unk> themselves . &quot;
&quot; Oh , yes ; of course it &apos;s very nice and proper in them to do so .
We have many most respectable and worthy young women , who do the same and are employed by the nobility , because , being the daughters of gentlemen , they are both well-bred and accomplished , you know , &quot; said Miss Kate , in a patronizing tone , that hurt Meg &apos;s pride , and made her work seem not only more <unk> , but <unk> .
&quot; Did the German song suit , Miss March ? &quot;
inquired Mr. Brooke , breaking an awkward pause .
&quot; Oh , yes !
it was very sweet , and I &apos;m much obliged to <unk> <unk> it for me ; &quot; and Meg &apos;s downcast face brightened as she spoke .
&quot; Don &apos;t you read German ? &quot;
asked Miss Kate , with a look of surprise .
&quot; Not very well .
My father , who taught me , is away , and I don &apos;t get on very fast alone , for I &apos;ve no one to correct my pronunciation . &quot;
&quot; Try a little now ; here is Schiller &apos;s &apos; Mary <unk> , &apos; and a tutor who loves to teach , &quot; and Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap , with an inviting smile .
&quot; It &apos;s so hard I &apos;m afraid to try , &quot; said Meg , grateful , but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her .
&quot; I &apos;ll read a bit to <unk> you ; &quot; and Miss Kate read one of the most beautiful passages , in a perfectly correct but perfectly <unk> manner .
Mr. Brooke made no <unk> , as she returned the book to Meg , who said innocently , -- &quot; I thought it was poetry . &quot;
&quot; Some of it is .
Try this <unk> . &quot;
There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke &apos;s mouth as he opened at poor Mary &apos;s lament .
Meg , obediently following the long <unk> which her new tutor used to point with , read slowly and <unk> , unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft <unk> of her musical voice .
Down the page went the green guide , and presently , forgetting her <unk> in the beauty of the sad scene , Meg read as if alone , giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen .
If she had seen the brown eyes then , she would have stopped short ; but she never looked up , and the lesson was not <unk> for her .
&quot; Very well indeed ! &quot;
said Mr. Brooke , as she paused , quite <unk> her many mistakes , and looking as if he did , indeed , &quot; love to teach . &quot;
Miss Kate put up her glass , and , having taken a <unk> of the little <unk> before her , shut her sketch-book , saying , with <unk> , -- &#91; Illustration : Miss Kate put up her glass &#93; &quot; You &apos;ve a nice accent , and , in time , will be a clever reader .
I advise you to learn , for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers .
I must look after Grace , she is romping ; &quot; and Miss Kate strolled away , adding to herself , with a shrug , &quot; I didn &apos;t come to <unk> a governess , though she _ is _ young and pretty .
What odd people these Yankees are ; I &apos;m afraid Laurie will be quite spoilt among them . &quot;
&quot; I forgot that English people rather turn up their <unk> at <unk> , and don &apos;t treat them as we do , &quot; said Meg , looking after the <unk> figure with an <unk> expression .
&quot; <unk> , also , have rather a hard time of it there , as I know to my sorrow .
There &apos;s no place like America for us <unk> , Miss Margaret ; &quot; and Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful , that Meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot .
&quot; I &apos;m glad I live in it then .
I don &apos;t like my work , but I get a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all , so I won &apos;t complain ; I only wish I liked teaching as you do . &quot;
&quot; I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil .
I shall be very sorry to lose him next year , &quot; said Mr. Brooke , busily <unk> <unk> in the turf .
&quot; Going to college , I suppose ? &quot;
Meg &apos;s lips asked that question , but her eyes added , &quot; And what becomes of you ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; it &apos;s high time he went , for he is ready ; and as soon as he is off , I shall turn <unk> .
I am needed . &quot;
&quot; I am glad of that ! &quot;
exclaimed Meg .
&quot; I should think every young man would want to go ; though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay at home , &quot; she added sorrowfully .
&quot; I have neither , and very few friends , to care whether I live or die , &quot; said Mr. Brooke , rather bitterly , as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up , like a little grave .
&quot; Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal , and we should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you , &quot; said Meg heartily .
&quot; Thank you ; that sounds pleasant , &quot; began Mr. Brooke , looking cheerful again ; but before he could finish his speech , Ned , mounted on the old horse , came <unk> up to display his <unk> skill before the young ladies , and there was no more quiet that day .
&quot; Don &apos;t you love to ride ? &quot;
asked Grace of Amy , as they stood resting , after a race round the field with the others , led by Ned .
&quot; I <unk> upon it ; my sister Meg used to ride when papa was rich , but we don &apos;t keep any horses now , except Ellen Tree , &quot; added Amy , laughing .
&quot; Tell me about Ellen Tree ; is it a <unk> ? &quot;
asked Grace curiously .
&#91; Illustration : Ellen Tree &#93; &quot; Why , you see , Jo is crazy about horses , and so am I , but we &apos;ve only got an old <unk> , and no horse .
Out in our garden is an apple-tree , that has a nice low <unk> ; so Jo put the saddle on it , fixed some reins on the part that turns up , and we bounce away on Ellen Tree whenever we like . &quot;
&quot; How funny ! &quot;
laughed Grace .
&quot; I have a <unk> at home , and ride nearly every day in the <unk> , with Fred and Kate ; it &apos;s very nice , for my friends go too , and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen . &quot;
&quot; Dear , how charming !
I hope I shall go abroad some day ; but I &apos;d rather go to Rome than the Row , &quot; said Amy , who had not the <unk> idea what the Row was , and wouldn &apos;t have asked for the world .
Frank , sitting just behind the little girls , heard what they were saying , and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics .
Beth , who was <unk> the scattered <unk> , looked up , and said , in her shy yet friendly way , -- &quot; I &apos;m afraid you are tired ; can I do anything for you ? &quot;
&quot; Talk to me , please ; it &apos;s dull , sitting by myself , &quot; answered Frank , who had evidently been used to being made much of at home .
If he had asked her to deliver a Latin <unk> , it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful Beth ; but there was no place to run to , no Jo to hide behind now , and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her , that she bravely resolved to try .
&quot; What do you like to talk about ? &quot;
she asked , <unk> over the cards , and dropping half as she tried to tie them up .
&quot; Well , I like to hear about cricket and boating and <unk> , &quot; said Frank , who had not yet learned to suit his <unk> to his strength .
&quot; My heart !
what shall I do ?
I don &apos;t know anything about them , &quot; thought Beth ; and , forgetting the boy &apos;s <unk> in her flurry , she said , hoping to make him talk , &quot; I never saw any <unk> , but I suppose you know all about it . &quot;
&quot; I did once ; but I can never hunt again , for I got hurt <unk> a confounded <unk> gate ; so there are no more horses and <unk> for me , &quot; said Frank , with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her innocent blunder .
&quot; Your deer are much prettier than our ugly <unk> , &quot; she said , turning to the <unk> for help , and feeling glad that she had read one of the boys &apos; books in which Jo delighted .
<unk> proved soothing and satisfactory ; and , in her <unk> to amuse another , Beth forgot herself , and was quite unconscious of her sisters &apos; surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys , against whom she had begged protection .
&quot; Bless her heart !
She <unk> him , so she is good to him , &quot; said Jo , beaming at her from the <unk> .
&quot; I always said she was a little saint , &quot; added Meg , as if there could be no further doubt of it .
&quot; I haven &apos;t heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long , &quot; said Grace to Amy , as they sat discussing dolls , and making <unk> out of the <unk> .
&quot; My sister Beth is a very _ fastidious _ girl , when she likes to be , &quot; said Amy , well pleased at Beth &apos;s success .
She meant &quot; fascinating , &quot; but as Grace didn &apos;t know the <unk> meaning of either word , &quot; fastidious &quot; sounded well , and made a good impression .
An impromptu <unk> , <unk> and geese , and an <unk> game of croquet , finished the afternoon .
At sunset the tent was struck , <unk> packed , <unk> pulled up , boats loaded , and the whole party floated down the river , singing at the <unk> of their voices .
Ned , getting sentimental , warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain , -- &quot; <unk> , alone , <unk> !
woe , alone , &quot; and at the <unk> &quot; We each are young , we each have a heart , Oh , why should we stand thus <unk> apart ? &quot;
he looked at Meg with such a <unk> expression that she laughed outright and spoilt his song .
&quot; How can you be so cruel to me ? &quot;
he whispered , under cover of a lively chorus .
&quot; You &apos;ve kept close to that <unk> <unk> all day , and now you snub me . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t mean to ; but you looked so funny I really couldn &apos;t help it , &quot; replied Meg , passing over the first part of his reproach ; for it was quite true that she _ had _ <unk> him , remembering the Moffat party and the talk after it .
Ned was offended , and turned to Sallie for consolation , saying to her rather <unk> , &quot; There isn &apos;t a bit of flirt in that girl , is there ? &quot;
&quot; Not a particle ; but she &apos;s a dear , &quot; returned Sallie , <unk> her friend even while <unk> her short-comings .
&quot; She &apos;s not a stricken deer , any way , &quot; said Ned , trying to be witty , and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do .
On the lawn , where it had gathered , the little party separated with cordial <unk> and <unk> , for the Vaughns were going to <unk> .
As the four sisters went home through the garden , Miss Kate looked after them , saying , without the patronizing tone in her voice , &quot; In spite of their <unk> manners , American girls are very nice when one knows them . &quot;
&quot; I quite agree with you , &quot; said Mr. Brooke .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : <unk> to and fro in his hammock &#93; <unk> .
<unk> IN THE <unk> .
Laurie lay luxuriously <unk> to and fro in his hammock , one warm <unk> afternoon , wondering what his neighbors were about , but too lazy to go and find out .
He was in one of his moods ; for the day had been both <unk> and <unk> , and he was wishing he could live it over again .
The hot weather made him indolent , and he had <unk> his <unk> , tried Mr. Brooke &apos;s patience to the <unk> , displeased his grandfather by practising half the afternoon , frightened the <unk> half out of their wits , by <unk> <unk> that one of his dogs was going mad , and , after high words with the <unk> about some fancied neglect of his horse , he had <unk> himself into his hammock , to <unk> over the <unk> of the world in general , till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself .
<unk> up into the green gloom of the <unk> trees above him , he dreamed dreams of all sorts , and was just imagining himself tossing on the <unk> , in a voyage round the world , when the sound of voices brought him <unk> in a flash .
<unk> through the <unk> of the hammock , he saw the Marches coming out , as if bound on some <unk> .
&quot; What in the world are those girls about now ? &quot;
thought Laurie , opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look , for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors .
Each wore a large , flapping hat , a brown linen <unk> <unk> over one shoulder , and carried a long staff .
Meg had a cushion , Jo a book , Beth a basket , and Amy a portfolio .
All walked quietly through the garden , out at the little back gate , and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river .
&quot; Well , that &apos;s cool ! &quot;
said Laurie to himself , &quot; to have a picnic and never ask me .
They can &apos;t be going in the boat , for they haven &apos;t got the key .
Perhaps they forgot it ; I &apos;ll take it to them , and see what &apos;s going on . &quot;
Though possessed of half a dozen hats , it took him some time to find one ; then there was a hunt for the key , which was at last discovered in his pocket ; so that the girls were quite out of sight when he <unk> the fence and ran after them .
Taking the <unk> way to the <unk> , he waited for them to appear : but no one came , and he went up the hill to take an observation .
A grove of <unk> covered one part of it , and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the <unk> or the <unk> chirp of the <unk> .
&quot; Here &apos;s a landscape ! &quot;
thought Laurie , peeping through the <unk> , and looking wide-awake and good-natured already .
It _ was _ rather a pretty little picture ; for the sisters sat together in the shady <unk> , with sun and shadow <unk> over them , the <unk> wind <unk> their hair and <unk> their hot cheeks , and all the little <unk> going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers , but old friends .
Meg sat upon her cushion , sewing <unk> with her white hands , and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose , in her pink dress , among the green .
Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the <unk> near by , for she made pretty things of them .
Amy was sketching a group of ferns , and Jo was knitting as she read aloud .
A shadow passed over the boy &apos;s face as he watched them , feeling that he ought to go away , because <unk> ; yet <unk> , because home seemed very lonely , and this quiet party in the <unk> most attractive to his restless spirit .
He stood so still that a squirrel , busy with its <unk> , ran down a <unk> close beside him , saw him suddenly and skipped back , scolding so <unk> that Beth looked up , <unk> the wistful face behind the <unk> , and beckoned with a <unk> smile .
&#91; Illustration : It was rather a pretty little picture &#93; &quot; May I come in , please ?
or shall I be a bother ? &quot;
he asked , <unk> slowly .
Meg lifted her eyebrows , but Jo <unk> at her <unk> , and said , at once , &quot; Of course you may .
We should have asked you before , only we thought you wouldn &apos;t care for such a girl &apos;s game as this . &quot;
&quot; I always liked your games ; but if Meg doesn &apos;t want me , I &apos;ll go away . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve no objection , if you do something ; it &apos;s against the rules to be idle here , &quot; replied Meg , gravely but graciously .
&quot; Much obliged ; I &apos;ll do anything if you &apos;ll let me stop a bit , for it &apos;s as dull as the <unk> of <unk> down there .
Shall I sew , read , <unk> , draw , or do all at once ?
Bring on your bears ; I &apos;m ready , &quot; and Laurie sat down , with a submissive expression delightful to behold .
&quot; <unk> this story while I set my heel , &quot; said Jo , handing him the book .
&quot; Yes &apos;m , &quot; was the <unk> answer , as he began , doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of an admission into the &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The story was not a long one , and , when it was finished , he <unk> to ask a few questions as a reward of <unk> .
&quot; Please , ma &apos;am , could I inquire if this highly <unk> and charming institution is a new one ? &quot;
&quot; Would you tell him ? &quot;
asked Meg of her sisters .
&quot; He &apos;ll laugh , &quot; said Amy <unk> .
&quot; Who cares ? &quot;
said Jo .
&quot; I guess he &apos;ll like it , &quot; added Beth .
&quot; Of course I shall !
I give you my word I won &apos;t laugh .
Tell away , Jo , and don &apos;t be afraid . &quot;
&quot; The idea of being afraid of you !
Well , you see we used to play &apos; Pilgrim &apos;s Progress , &apos; and we have been going on with it in earnest , all winter and summer . &quot;
&quot; Yes , I know , &quot; said Laurie , nodding wisely .
&quot; Who told you ? &quot;
demanded Jo .
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; No , I did ; I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away , and he was rather dismal .
He did like it , so don &apos;t scold , Jo , &quot; said Beth meekly .
&quot; You can &apos;t keep a secret .
Never mind ; it <unk> trouble now . &quot;
&quot; Go on , please , &quot; said Laurie , as Jo became absorbed in her work , looking a trifle displeased .
&quot; Oh , didn &apos;t she tell you about this new plan of ours ?
Well , we have tried not to waste our holiday , but each has had a task , and worked at it with a will .
The vacation is nearly over , the <unk> are all done , and we are ever so glad that we didn &apos;t dawdle . &quot;
&quot; Yes , I should think so ; &quot; and Laurie thought <unk> of his own idle days .
&quot; Mother likes to have us out of doors as much as possible ; so we bring our work here , and have nice times .
For the fun of it we bring our things in these bags , wear the old hats , use <unk> to climb the hill , and play pilgrims , as we used to do years ago .
We call this hill the &apos; <unk> <unk> , &apos; for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time . &quot;
Jo pointed , and Laurie sat up to examine ; for through an opening in the wood one could look across the wide , blue river , the <unk> on the other side , far over the <unk> of the great city , to the green hills that rose to meet the sky .
The sun was low , and the <unk> <unk> with the splendor of an autumn sunset .
<unk> and purple clouds lay on the <unk> ; and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white <unk> , that shone like the airy <unk> of some Celestial City .
&quot; How beautiful that is ! &quot;
said Laurie softly , for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind .
&quot; It &apos;s often so ; and we like to watch it , for it is never the same , but always splendid , &quot; replied Amy , wishing she could paint it .
&quot; Jo talks about the country where we hope to live some time , --the real country , she means , with <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> .
It would be nice , but I wish the beautiful country up there was real , and we could ever go to it , &quot; said Beth <unk> .
&quot; There is a <unk> country even than that , where we _ shall _ go , by and by , when we are good enough , &quot; answered Meg , with her sweet voice .
&quot; It seems so long to wait , so hard to do ; I want to fly away at once , as those <unk> fly , and go in at that splendid gate . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll get there , Beth , sooner or later ; no fear of that , &quot; said Jo ; &quot; I &apos;m the one that will have to fight and work , and climb and wait , and maybe never get in after all . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll have me for company , if that &apos;s any comfort .
I shall have to do a deal of travelling before I come in sight of your Celestial City .
If I arrive late , you &apos;ll say a good word for me , won &apos;t you , Beth ? &quot;
Something in the boy &apos;s face troubled his little friend ; but she said cheerfully , with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds , &quot; If people really want to go , and really try all their lives , I think they will get in ; for I don &apos;t believe there are any locks on that door , or any <unk> at the gate .
I always imagine it is as it is in the picture , where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor Christian as he comes up from the river . &quot;
&quot; Wouldn &apos;t it be fun if all the <unk> in the air which we make could come true , and we could live in them ? &quot;
said Jo , after a little pause .
&quot; I &apos;ve made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I &apos;d have , &quot; said Laurie , lying flat , and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him .
&quot; You &apos;d have to take your favorite one .
What is it ? &quot;
asked Meg .
&quot; If I tell mine , will you tell yours ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , if the girls will too . &quot;
&quot; We will .
Now , Laurie . &quot;
&quot; After I &apos;d seen as much of the world as I want to , I &apos;d like to settle in Germany , and have just as much music as I choose .
I &apos;m to be a famous musician myself , and all creation is to rush to hear me ; and I &apos;m never to be <unk> about money or business , but just enjoy myself , and live for what I like .
That &apos;s my favorite castle .
What &apos;s yours , Meg ? &quot;
Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers , and waved a brake before her face , as if to <unk> imaginary <unk> , while she said slowly , &quot; I should like a lovely house , full of all sorts of luxurious things , <unk> food , pretty clothes , handsome furniture , pleasant people , and heaps of money .
I am to be mistress of it , and manage it as I like , with plenty of servants , so I never need work a bit .
How I should enjoy it !
for I wouldn &apos;t be idle , but do good , and make every one love me dearly . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : <unk> a brake before her face &#93; &quot; Wouldn &apos;t you have a master for your castle in the air ? &quot;
asked Laurie slyly .
&quot; I said &apos; pleasant people , &apos; you know ; &quot; and Meg carefully tied up her shoe as she spoke , so that no one saw her face .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you say you &apos;d have a splendid , wise , good husband , and some angelic little children ?
You know your castle wouldn &apos;t be perfect without , &quot; said blunt Jo , who had no tender fancies yet , and rather <unk> romance , except in books .
&quot; You &apos;d have nothing but horses , <unk> , and novels in yours , &quot; answered Meg petulantly .
&quot; Wouldn &apos;t I , though ?
I &apos;d have a <unk> full of <unk> <unk> , rooms piled with books , and I &apos;d write out of a magic inkstand , so that my works should be as famous as Laurie &apos;s music .
I want to do something splendid before I go into my castle , <unk> heroic or wonderful , that won &apos;t be forgotten after I &apos;m dead .
I don &apos;t know what , but I &apos;m on the watch for it , and mean to astonish you all , some day .
I think I shall write books , and get rich and famous : that would suit me , so that is _ my _ favorite dream . &quot;
&quot; Mine is to stay at home safe with father and mother , and help take care of the family , &quot; said Beth <unk> .
&quot; Don &apos;t you wish for anything else ? &quot;
asked Laurie .
&quot; Since I had my little piano , I am perfectly satisfied .
I only wish we may all keep well and be together ; nothing else . &quot;
&quot; I have ever so many wishes ; but the pet one is to be an artist , and go to Rome , and do fine pictures , and be the best artist in the whole world , &quot; was Amy &apos;s modest desire .
&quot; We &apos;re an ambitious set , aren &apos;t we ?
Every one of us , but Beth , wants to be rich and famous , and gorgeous in every respect .
I do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes , &quot; said Laurie , <unk> grass , like a meditative <unk> .
&quot; I &apos;ve got the key to my castle in the air ; but whether I can <unk> the door remains to be seen , &quot; observed Jo mysteriously .
&quot; I &apos;ve got the key to mine , but I &apos;m not allowed to try it .
Hang college ! &quot;
muttered Laurie , with an impatient sigh .
&quot; Here &apos;s mine ! &quot;
and Amy waved her pencil .
&quot; I haven &apos;t got any , &quot; said Meg forlornly .
&quot; Yes , you have , &quot; said Laurie at once .
&quot; Where ? &quot;
&quot; In your face . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ; that &apos;s of no use . &quot;
&quot; Wait and see if it doesn &apos;t bring you something worth having , &quot; replied the boy , laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he fancied he knew .
Meg colored behind the brake , but asked no questions , and looked across the river with the same <unk> expression which Mr. Brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight .
&quot; If we are all alive ten years <unk> , let &apos;s meet , and see how many of us have got our wishes , or how much nearer we are then than now , &quot; said Jo , always ready with a plan .
&quot; Bless me !
how old I shall be , <unk> ! &quot;
exclaimed Meg who felt grown up already , having just reached seventeen .
&quot; You and I shall be <unk> , Teddy , Beth twenty-four , and Amy <unk> .
What a venerable party ! &quot;
said Jo .
&quot; I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time ; but I &apos;m such a lazy dog , I &apos;m afraid I shall &apos; dawdle , &apos; Jo . &quot;
&quot; You need a <unk> , mother says ; and when you get it , she is sure you &apos;ll work splendidly . &quot;
&quot; Is she ?
By Jupiter I will , if I only get the chance ! &quot;
cried Laurie , sitting up with sudden energy .
&quot; I ought to be satisfied to please grandfather , and I do try , but it &apos;s working against the <unk> , you see , and comes hard .
He wants me to be an <unk> <unk> , as he was , and I &apos;d rather be shot .
I hate tea and silk and <unk> , and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring , and I don &apos;t care how soon they go to the bottom when I own them .
Going to college ought to satisfy him , for if I give him four years he ought to let me off from the business ; but he &apos;s set , and I &apos; <unk> got to do just as he did , unless I break away and please myself , as my father did .
If there was any one left to stay with the old gentleman , I &apos;d do it to-morrow . &quot;
Laurie spoke excitedly , and looked ready to carry his <unk> into <unk> on the slightest <unk> ; for he was growing up very fast , and , in spite of his indolent ways , had a young man &apos;s <unk> of <unk> , a young man &apos;s restless longing to try the world for himself .
&quot; I advise you to sail away in one of your ships , and never come home again till you have tried your own way , &quot; said Jo , whose <unk> was fired by the thought of such a daring <unk> , and whose sympathy was excited by what she called &quot; Teddy &apos;s wrongs . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s not right , Jo ; you mustn &apos;t talk in that way , and Laurie mustn &apos;t take your bad advice .
You should do just what your grandfather wishes , my dear boy , &quot; said Meg , in her most maternal tone .
&quot; Do your best at college , and , when he sees that you try to please him , I &apos;m sure he won &apos;t be hard or unjust to you .
As you say , there is no one else to stay with and love him , and you &apos;d never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission .
Don &apos;t be dismal or fret , but do your duty ; and you &apos;ll get your reward , as good Mr. Brooke has , by being respected and loved . &quot;
&quot; What do you know about him ? &quot;
asked Laurie , grateful for the good advice , but <unk> to the lecture , and glad to turn the conversation from himself , after his unusual <unk> .
&quot; Only what your grandpa told us about him , --how he took good care of his own mother till she died , and wouldn &apos;t go abroad as tutor to some nice person , because he wouldn &apos;t leave her ; and how he <unk> now for an old woman who nursed his mother ; and never tells any one , but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be . &quot;
&quot; So he is , dear old fellow ! &quot;
said Laurie heartily , as Meg paused , looking flushed and earnest with her story .
&quot; It &apos;s like grandpa to find out all about him , without letting him know , and to tell all his goodness to others , so that they might like him .
Brooke couldn &apos;t understand why your mother was so kind to him , asking him over with me , and <unk> him in her beautiful friendly way .
He thought she was just perfect , and talked about it for days and days , and went on about you all in <unk> style .
If ever I do get my wish , you see what I &apos;ll do for Brooke . &quot;
&quot; <unk> to do something now , by not <unk> his life out , &quot; said Meg sharply .
&quot; How do you know I do , miss ? &quot;
&quot; I can always tell by his face , when he goes away .
If you have been good , he looks satisfied and walks briskly ; if you have <unk> him , he &apos;s sober and walks slowly , as if he wanted to go back and do his work better . &quot;
&quot; Well , I like that !
So you keep an account of my good and bad <unk> in Brooke &apos;s face , do you ?
I see him bow and smile as he <unk> your window , but I didn &apos;t know you &apos;d got up a telegraph . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : I see him bow and smile &#93; &quot; We haven &apos;t ; don &apos;t be angry , and oh , don &apos;t tell him I said anything !
It was only to show that I cared how you get on , and what is said here is said in confidence , you know , &quot; cried Meg , much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless speech .
&quot; _ I _ don &apos;t tell tales , &quot; replied Laurie , with his &quot; high and mighty &quot; air , as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore .
&quot; Only if Brooke is going to be a <unk> , I must mind and have fair weather for him to report . &quot;
&quot; Please don &apos;t be offended .
I didn &apos;t mean to preach or tell tales or be silly ; I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you &apos;d be sorry for , by and by .
You are so kind to us , we feel as if you were our brother , and say just what we think .
Forgive me , I meant it kindly . &quot;
And Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid .
<unk> of his momentary <unk> , Laurie squeezed the kind little hand , and said frankly , &quot; I &apos;m the one to be forgiven ; I &apos;m cross , and have been out of sorts all day .
I like to have you tell me my faults and be sisterly , so don &apos;t mind if I am <unk> sometimes ; I thank you all the same . &quot;
<unk> on showing that he was not offended , he made himself as agreeable as possible , <unk> cotton for Meg , <unk> poetry to please Jo , shook down cones for Beth , and helped Amy with her ferns , proving himself a fit person to belong to the &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
In the midst of an <unk> discussion on the domestic habits of <unk> ( one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river ) , the faint sound of a bell <unk> them that Hannah had put the tea &quot; to draw , &quot; and they would just have time to get home to supper .
&quot; May I come again ? &quot;
asked Laurie .
&quot; Yes , if you are good , and love your book , as the boys in the <unk> are told to do , &quot; said Meg smiling .
&quot; I &apos;ll try . &quot;
&quot; Then you may come , and I &apos;ll teach you to knit as the <unk> do ; there &apos;s a demand for socks just now , &quot; added Jo , waving hers , like a big blue worsted <unk> , as they parted at the gate .
That night , when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight , Laurie , standing in the shadow of the curtain , listened to the little David , whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit , and watched the old man , who sat with his gray head on his hand , thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much .
<unk> the conversation of the afternoon , the boy said to himself , with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully , &quot; I &apos;ll let my castle go , and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me , for I am all he has . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : Jo was very busy &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
Jo was very busy in the garret , for the October days began to grow chilly , and the afternoons were short .
For two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window , showing Jo seated on the old sofa , writing busily , with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her , while Scrabble , the pet <unk> , promenaded the <unk> overhead , accompanied by his oldest son , a fine young fellow , who was evidently very proud of his <unk> .
Quite absorbed in her work , Jo scribbled away till the last page was filled , when she <unk> her name with a flourish , and threw down her pen , exclaiming , -- &quot; There , I &apos;ve done my best !
If this won &apos;t suit I shall have to wait till I can do better . &quot;
<unk> back on the sofa , she read the manuscript carefully through , making <unk> here and there , and putting in many exclamation points , which looked like little <unk> ; then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon , and sat a minute looking at it with a sober , wistful expression , which plainly showed how earnest her work had been .
Jo &apos;s desk up here was an old tin kitchen , which hung against the wall .
In it she kept her papers and a few books , safely shut away from Scrabble , who , being likewise of a literary turn , was fond of making a <unk> library of such books as were left in his way , by eating the leaves .
From this tin <unk> Jo produced another manuscript ; and , putting both in her pocket , crept quietly down stairs , leaving her friends to <unk> her pens and taste her ink .
She put on her hat and <unk> as noiselessly as possible , and , going to the back entry window , got out upon the roof of a low porch , swung herself down to the <unk> bank , and took a <unk> way to the road .
Once there , she composed herself , hailed a passing omnibus , and rolled away to town , looking very merry and mysterious .
If any one had been watching her , he would have thought her <unk> decidedly peculiar ; for , on <unk> , she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street ; having found the place with some difficulty , she went into the door-way , looked up the dirty stairs , and , after standing stock still a minute , suddenly <unk> into the street , and walked away as rapidly as she came .
This man ? <unk> she repeated several times , to the great amusement of a <unk> young gentleman lounging in the window of a <unk> opposite .
On returning for the third time , Jo gave herself a shake , pulled her hat over her eyes , and walked up the stairs , looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out .
There was a <unk> &apos;s sign , among others , which adorned the <unk> , and , after staring a moment at the pair of <unk> <unk> which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth , the young gentleman put on his coat , took his hat , and went down to post himself in the opposite door-way , saying , with a smile and a shiver , -- &quot; It &apos;s like her to come alone , but if she has a bad time she &apos;ll need some one to help her home . &quot;
In ten minutes Jo came running down stairs with a very red face , and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying <unk> of some sort .
When she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased , and passed him with a nod ; but he followed , asking with an air of sympathy , -- &quot; Did you have a bad time ? &quot;
&quot; Not very . &quot;
&quot; You got through quickly . &quot;
&quot; Yes , thank goodness ! &quot;
&quot; Why did you go alone ? &quot;
&quot; Didn &apos;t want any one to know . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re the <unk> fellow I ever saw .
How many did you have out ? &quot;
Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him ; then began to laugh , as if <unk> amused at something .
&quot; There are two which I want to have come out , but I must wait a week . &quot;
&quot; What are you laughing at ?
You are up to some mischief , Jo , &quot; said Laurie , looking <unk> .
&quot; So are you .
What were you doing , sir , up in that <unk> saloon ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> your pardon , ma &apos;am , it wasn &apos;t a <unk> saloon , but a <unk> , and I was taking a lesson in <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad of that . &quot;
&quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; You can teach me , and then when we play Hamlet , you can be <unk> , and we &apos;ll make a fine thing of the <unk> scene . &quot;
Laurie burst out with a hearty boy &apos;s laugh , which made several <unk> smile in spite of themselves .
&quot; I &apos;ll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not ; it &apos;s grand fun , and will <unk> you up capitally .
But I don &apos;t believe that was your only reason for saying &apos; I &apos;m glad , &apos; in that decided way ; was it , now ? &quot;
&quot; No , I was glad that you were not in the saloon , because I hope you never go to such places .
Do you ? &quot;
&quot; Not often . &quot;
&quot; I wish you wouldn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s no harm , Jo .
I have <unk> at home , but it &apos;s no fun unless you have good <unk> ; so , as I &apos;m fond of it , I come sometimes and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows . &quot;
&quot; Oh dear , I &apos;m so sorry , for you &apos;ll get to liking it better and better , and will waste time and money , and grow like those dreadful boys .
I did hope you &apos;d stay respectable , and be a satisfaction to your friends , &quot; said Jo , shaking her head .
&quot; Can &apos;t a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his <unk> ? &quot;
asked Laurie , looking nettled .
&quot; That depends upon how and where he takes it .
I don &apos;t like Ned and his set , and wish you &apos;d keep out of it .
Mother won &apos;t let us have him at our house , though he wants to come ; and if you grow like him she won &apos;t be willing to have us frolic together as we do now . &quot;
&quot; Won &apos;t she ? &quot;
asked Laurie anxiously .
&quot; No , she can &apos;t bear fashionable young men , and she &apos;d shut us all up in <unk> rather than have us associate with them . &quot;
&quot; Well , she needn &apos;t get out her <unk> yet ; I &apos;m not a fashionable party , and don &apos;t mean to be ; but I do like harmless larks now and then , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , nobody minds them , so lark away , but don &apos;t get wild , will you ?
or there will be an end of all our good times . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll be a <unk> saint . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t bear <unk> : just be a simple , honest , respectable boy , and we &apos;ll never desert you .
I don &apos;t know what I _ should _ do if you acted like Mr. King &apos;s son ; he had plenty of money , but didn &apos;t know how to spend it , and got <unk> and <unk> , and ran away , and <unk> his father &apos;s name , I believe , and was altogether horrid . &quot;
&quot; You think I &apos;m likely to do the same ?
Much obliged . &quot;
&quot; No , I don <unk> , _ dear _ , no ! --but I hear people talking about money being such a temptation , and I sometimes wish you were poor ; I shouldn &apos;t worry then . &quot;
&quot; Do you worry about me , Jo ? &quot;
&quot; A little , when you look moody or discontented , as you sometimes do ; for you &apos;ve got such a strong will , if you once get started wrong , I &apos;m afraid it would be hard to stop you . &quot;
Laurie walked in silence a few minutes , and Jo watched him , wishing she had held her tongue , for his eyes looked angry , though his lips still smiled as if at her <unk> .
&quot; Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home ? &quot;
he asked presently .
&quot; Of course not ; why ? &quot;
&quot; Because if you are , I &apos;ll take a &apos; <unk> ; if you are not , I &apos;d like to walk with you , and tell you something very interesting . &quot;
&quot; I won &apos;t preach any more , and I &apos;d like to hear the news immensely . &quot;
&quot; Very well , then ; come on .
It &apos;s a secret , and if I tell you , you must tell me yours . &quot;
&quot; I haven &apos;t got any , &quot; began Jo , but stopped suddenly , remembering that she had .
&quot; You know you have , <unk> can &apos;t hide anything ; so up and &apos; fess , or I won &apos;t tell , &quot; cried Laurie .
&quot; Is your secret a nice one ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , isn &apos;t it !
all about people you know , and such fun !
You ought to hear it , and I &apos;ve been aching to tell it this long time .
Come , you begin . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll not say anything about it at home , will you ? &quot;
&quot; Not a word . &quot;
&quot; And you won &apos;t tease me in private ? &quot;
&quot; I never tease . &quot;
&quot; Yes , you do ; you get everything you want out of people .
I don &apos;t know how you do it , but you are a born <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Thank you ; fire away . &quot;
&quot; Well , I &apos;ve left two stories with a newspaper man , and he &apos;s to give his answer next week , &quot; whispered Jo , in her confidant &apos;s ear .
&quot; Hurrah for Miss March , the <unk> American authoress ! &quot;
cried Laurie , throwing up his hat and catching it again , to the great delight of two <unk> , four cats , five <unk> , and half a dozen Irish children ; for they were out of the city now .
&#91; Illustration : Hurrah for Miss March &#93; &quot; Hush !
It won &apos;t come to anything , I dare say ; but I couldn &apos;t rest till I had tried , and I said nothing about it , because I didn &apos;t want any one else to be disappointed . &quot;
&quot; It won &apos;t fail .
Why , Jo , your stories are works of Shakespeare , compared to half the rubbish that is published every day .
Won &apos;t it be fun to see them in print ; and sha &apos;n&apos;t we feel proud of our authoress ? &quot;
Jo &apos;s eyes sparkled , for it is always pleasant to be believed in ; and a friend &apos;s praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper <unk> .
&quot; Where &apos;s _ your _ secret ?
<unk> fair , Teddy , or I &apos;ll never believe you again , &quot; she said , trying to <unk> the brilliant hopes that <unk> up at a word of <unk> .
&quot; I may get into a scrape for telling ; but I didn &apos;t promise not to , so I will , for I never feel easy in my mind till I &apos;ve told you any <unk> bit of news I get .
I know where Meg &apos;s glove is . &quot;
&quot; Is that all ? &quot;
said Jo , looking disappointed , as Laurie nodded and twinkled , with a face full of mysterious <unk> .
&quot; It &apos;s quite enough for the present , as you &apos;ll agree when I tell you where it is . &quot;
&quot; Tell , then . &quot;
Laurie bent , and whispered three words in Jo &apos;s ear , which produced a comical change .
She stood and stared at him for a minute , looking both surprised and displeased , then walked on , saying sharply , &quot; How do you know ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> it . &quot;
&quot; Where ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All this time ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; isn &apos;t that romantic ? &quot;
&quot; No , it &apos;s horrid . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you like it ? &quot;
&quot; Of course I don &apos;t .
It &apos;s ridiculous ; it won &apos;t be allowed .
My patience !
what would Meg say ? &quot;
&quot; You are not to tell any one ; mind that . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t promise . &quot;
&quot; That was understood , and I trusted you . &quot;
&quot; Well , I won &apos;t for the present , any way ; but I &apos;m disgusted , and wish you hadn &apos;t told me . &quot;
&quot; I thought you &apos;d be pleased . &quot;
&quot; At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away ?
No , thank you . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d like to see any one try it , &quot; cried Jo <unk> .
&quot; So should I ! &quot;
and Laurie <unk> at the idea .
&quot; I don &apos;t think secrets agree with me ; I feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that , &quot; said Jo , rather <unk> .
&quot; <unk> down this hill with me , and you &apos;ll be all right , &quot; suggested Laurie .
No one was in sight ; the smooth road <unk> invitingly before her ; and finding the temptation irresistible , Jo darted away , soon leaving hat and <unk> behind her , and <unk> hair-pins as she ran .
Laurie reached the <unk> first , and was quite satisfied with the success of his <unk> ; for his <unk> came <unk> up , with flying hair , bright eyes , ruddy cheeks , and no signs of <unk> in her face .
&#91; Illustration : Jo darted away &#93; &quot; I wish I was a horse ; then I could run for miles in this splendid air , and not lose my breath .
It was capital ; but see what a guy it &apos;s made me .
Go , pick up my things , like a cherub as you are , &quot; said Jo , dropping down under a <unk> , which was <unk> the bank with crimson leaves .
Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property , and Jo bundled up her <unk> , hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again .
But some one did pass , and who should it be but Meg , looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit , for she had been making calls .
&quot; What in the world are you doing here ? &quot;
she asked , regarding her dishevelled sister with well-bred surprise .
&quot; <unk> leaves , &quot; meekly answered Jo , sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up .
&quot; And hair-pins , &quot; added Laurie , throwing half a dozen into Jo &apos;s lap .
&quot; They grow on this road , Meg ; so do <unk> and brown <unk> hats . &quot;
&quot; You have been running , Jo ; how could you ?
When _ will _ you stop such romping ways ? &quot;
said Meg reprovingly , as she settled her <unk> , and smoothed her hair , with which the wind had taken liberties .
&quot; Never till I &apos;m stiff and old , and have to use a crutch .
Don &apos;t try to make me grow up before my time , Meg : it &apos;s hard enough to have you change all of a sudden ; let me be a little girl as long as I can . &quot;
As she spoke , Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips ; for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a woman , and Laurie &apos;s secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time , and now seemed very near .
He saw the trouble in her face , and drew Meg &apos;s attention from it by asking quickly , &quot; Where have you been calling , all so fine ? &quot;
&quot; At the <unk> &apos; , and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle Moffat &apos;s wedding .
It was very splendid , and they have gone to spend the winter in Paris .
Just think how delightful that must be ! &quot;
&quot; Do you envy her , Meg ? &quot;
said Laurie .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid I do . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad of it ! &quot;
muttered Jo , <unk> on her hat with a <unk> .
&quot; Why ? &quot;
asked Meg , looking surprised .
&quot; Because if you care much about <unk> , you will never go and marry a poor man , &quot; said Jo , <unk> at Laurie , who was mutely warning her to mind what she said .
&quot; I shall never &apos; _ go _ and marry &apos; any one , &quot; observed Meg , walking on with great dignity , while the others followed , laughing , whispering , <unk> <unk> , and &quot; <unk> like children , &quot; as Meg said to herself , though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on .
For a week or two , Jo behaved so <unk> that her sisters were quite bewildered .
She rushed to the door when the <unk> rang ; was rude to Mr. Brooke whenever they met ; would sit looking at Meg with a <unk> face , occasionally <unk> up to shake , and then to kiss her , in a very mysterious manner ; Laurie and she were always making signs to one another , and talking about &quot; Spread <unk> , &quot; till the girls declared they had both lost their wits .
On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the window , Meg , as she sat sewing at her window , was scandalized by the sight of Laurie <unk> Jo all over the garden , and finally <unk> her in Amy &apos;s bower .
What went on there , Meg could not see ; but <unk> of laughter were heard , followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers .
&quot; What shall we do with that girl ?
She never _ will _ behave like a young lady , &quot; sighed Meg , as she watched the race with a <unk> face .
&quot; I hope she won &apos;t ; she is so funny and dear as she is , &quot; said Beth , who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo &apos;s having secrets with any one but her .
&quot; It &apos;s very trying , but we never can make her _ <unk> la <unk> _ , &quot; added Amy , who sat making some new <unk> for herself , with her curls tied up in a very becoming way , <unk> agreeable things , which made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike .
In a few minutes Jo bounced in , laid herself on the sofa , and affected to read .
&#91; Illustration : Jo laid herself on the sofa and affected to read &#93; &quot; Have you anything interesting there ? &quot;
asked Meg , with <unk> .
&quot; Nothing but a story ; won &apos;t amount to much , I guess , &quot; returned Jo , carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight .
&quot; You &apos;d better read it aloud ; that will amuse us and keep you out of mischief , &quot; said Amy , in her most grown-up tone .
&quot; What &apos;s the name ? &quot;
asked Beth , wondering why Jo kept her face behind the sheet .
&quot; The <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; That sounds well ; read it , &quot; said Meg .
With a loud &quot; Hem ! &quot;
and a long breath , Jo began to read very fast .
The girls listened with interest , for the tale was romantic , and somewhat pathetic , as most of the characters died in the end .
&quot; I like that about the splendid picture , &quot; was Amy &apos;s approving remark , as Jo paused .
&quot; I prefer the lovering part .
Viola and <unk> are two of our favorite names ; isn &apos;t that queer ? &quot;
said Meg , <unk> her eyes , for the &quot; lovering part &quot; was tragical .
&quot; Who wrote it ? &quot;
asked Beth , who had caught a glimpse of Jo &apos;s face .
The reader suddenly sat up , cast away the paper , displaying a flushed countenance , and , with a funny mixture of <unk> and excitement , replied in a loud voice , &quot; Your sister . &quot;
&quot; You ? &quot;
cried Meg , dropping her work .
&quot; It &apos;s very good , &quot; said Amy <unk> .
&quot; I knew it !
I knew it !
O my Jo , I _ am _ so proud ! &quot;
and Beth ran to hug her sister , and exult over this splendid success .
Dear me , how delighted they all were , to be sure !
how Meg wouldn &apos;t believe it till she saw the words , &quot; Miss Josephine March , &quot; actually printed in the paper ; how graciously Amy criticised the artistic parts of the story , and offered hints for a sequel , which unfortunately couldn &apos;t be carried out , as the hero and heroine were dead ; how Beth got excited , and skipped and sung with joy ; how Hannah came in to exclaim &quot; <unk> alive , well I never ! &quot;
in great <unk> at &quot; that Jo &apos;s <unk> &apos;s ; &quot; how proud Mrs. March was when she knew it ; how Jo laughed , with tears in her eyes , as she declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it ; and how the &quot; Spread Eagle &quot; might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the <unk> of March , as the paper passed from hand to hand .
&quot; Tell us all about it . &quot;
&quot; When did it come ? &quot;
&quot; How much did you get for it ? &quot;
&quot; What _ will _ father say ? &quot;
&quot; Won &apos;t Laurie laugh ? &quot;
cried the family , all in one breath , as they <unk> about Jo ; for these foolish , affectionate people made a <unk> of every little household joy .
&quot; Stop <unk> , girls , and I &apos;ll tell you everything , &quot; said Jo , wondering if Miss <unk> felt any <unk> over her &quot; <unk> &quot; than she did over her &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Having told how she disposed of her tales , Jo added , &quot; And when I went to get my answer , the man said he liked them both , but didn &apos;t pay <unk> , only let them print in his paper , and <unk> the stories .
It was good practice , he said ; and when the <unk> improved , any one would pay .
So I let him have the two stories , and to-day this was sent to me , and Laurie caught me with it , and insisted on seeing it , so I let him ; and he said it was good , and I shall write more , and he &apos;s going to get the next paid for , and I _ am _ so happy , for in time I may be able to support myself and help the girls . &quot;
Jo &apos;s breath gave out here ; and , <unk> her head in the paper , she <unk> her little story with a few natural tears ; for to be independent , and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart , and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end .
<unk> .
A <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : November is the most disagreeable month in the year &#93; &quot; November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year , &quot; said Margaret , standing at the window one dull afternoon , looking out at the <unk> garden .
&quot; That &apos;s the reason I was born in it , &quot; observed Jo <unk> , quite unconscious of the <unk> on her nose .
&quot; If something very pleasant should happen now , we should think it a delightful month , &quot; said Beth , who took a hopeful view of everything , even November .
&quot; I dare say ; but nothing pleasant ever _ does _ happen in this family , &quot; said Meg , who was out of sorts .
&quot; We go <unk> along day after day , without a bit of change , and very little fun .
We might as well be in a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; My patience , how blue we are ! &quot;
cried Jo .
&quot; I don &apos;t much wonder , poor dear , for you see other girls having splendid times , while you grind , grind , year in and year out .
Oh , don &apos;t I wish I could manage things for you as I do for my <unk> !
You &apos;re pretty enough and good enough already , so I &apos;d have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly ; then you &apos;d dash out as an <unk> , scorn every one who has <unk> you , go abroad , and come home my Lady Something , in a blaze of splendor and elegance . &quot;
&quot; People don &apos;t have fortunes left them in that style <unk> ; men have to work , and women to marry for money .
It &apos;s a dreadfully unjust world , &quot; said Meg bitterly .
&quot; Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all ; just wait ten years , and see if we don &apos;t , &quot; said Amy , who sat in a corner , making mud pies , as Hannah called her little clay models of birds , fruit , and faces .
&quot; Can &apos;t wait , and I &apos;m afraid I haven &apos;t much faith in ink and dirt , though I &apos;m grateful for your good intentions . &quot;
Meg sighed , and turned to the <unk> garden again ; Jo groaned , and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude , but Amy <unk> away energetically ; and Beth , who sat at the other window , said , smiling , &quot; Two pleasant things are going to happen right away : Marmee is coming down the street , and Laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell . &quot;
In they both came , Mrs. March with her usual question , &quot; Any letter from father , girls ? &quot;
and Laurie to say in his persuasive way , &quot; Won &apos;t some of you come for a drive ?
I &apos;ve been working away at <unk> till my head is in a muddle , and I &apos;m going to <unk> my wits by a brisk turn .
It &apos;s a dull day , but the air isn &apos;t bad , and I &apos;m going to take Brooke home , so it will be gay inside , if it isn &apos;t out .
Come , Jo , you and Beth will go , won &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Of course we will . &quot;
&quot; Much obliged , but I &apos;m busy ; &quot; and Meg whisked out her work-basket , for she had agreed with her mother that it was best , for her at least , not to drive often with the young gentleman .
&quot; We three will be ready in a minute , &quot; cried Amy , running away to wash her hands .
&quot; Can I do anything for you , Madam Mother ? &quot;
asked Laurie , leaning over Mrs. March &apos;s chair , with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her .
&quot; No , thank you , except call at the office , if you &apos;ll be so kind , dear .
It &apos;s our day for a letter , and the <unk> hasn &apos;t been .
Father is as regular as the sun , but there &apos;s some delay on the way , perhaps . &quot;
A sharp ring interrupted her , and a minute after Hannah came in with a letter .
&quot; It &apos;s one of them horrid telegraph things , mum , &quot; she said , handing it as if she was afraid it would <unk> and do some damage .
&#91; Illustration : One of them horrid telegraph things &#93; At the word &quot; telegraph , &quot; Mrs. March snatched it , read the two lines it contained , and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a <unk> to her heart .
Laurie <unk> down stairs for water , while Meg and Hannah <unk> her , and Jo read aloud , in a frightened voice , -- &quot; <unk> MARCH : &quot; Your husband is very ill . Come at once .
&quot; S. <unk> , &quot; <unk> Hospital , Washington &quot; How still the room was as they listened breathlessly , how <unk> the day darkened outside , and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change , as the girls gathered about their mother , feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them .
Mrs. March was herself again directly ; read the message over , and stretched out her arms to her daughters , saying , in a tone they never forgot , &quot; I shall go at once , but it may be too late .
O children , children , help me to bear it ! &quot;
For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room , mingled with broken words of comfort , tender assurances of help , and hopeful whispers that died away in tears .
Poor Hannah was the first to recover , and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example ; for , with her , work was the <unk> for most <unk> .
&quot; The Lord keep the dear man !
I won &apos;t waste no time a <unk> &apos; , but <unk> your things ready right away , mum , &quot; she said , heartily , as she wiped her face on her apron , gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one , and went away , to work like three women in one .
&quot; She &apos;s right ; there &apos;s no time for tears now .
Be calm , girls , and let me think . &quot;
They tried to be calm , poor things , as their mother sat up , looking pale , but steady , and put away her grief to think and plan for them .
&quot; Where &apos;s Laurie ? &quot;
she asked presently , when she had collected her thoughts , and decided on the first duties to be done .
&quot; Here , ma &apos;am .
Oh , let me do something ! &quot;
cried the boy , hurrying from the next room , whither he had <unk> , feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see .
&quot; Send a telegram saying I will come at once .
The next train goes early in the morning .
I &apos;ll take that . &quot;
&quot; What else ?
The horses are ready ; I can go anywhere , do anything , &quot; he said , looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth .
&quot; Leave a note at Aunt March &apos;s .
Jo , give me that pen and paper . &quot;
<unk> off the <unk> side of one of her newly copied pages , Jo drew the table before her mother , well knowing that money for the long , sad journey must be borrowed , and feeling as if she could do anything to add a little to the sum for her father .
&quot; Now go , dear ; but don &apos;t kill yourself <unk> at a desperate pace ; there is no need of that . &quot;
Mrs. March &apos;s warning was evidently thrown away ; for five minutes later Laurie tore by the window on his own <unk> horse , riding as if for his life .
&quot; Jo , run to the rooms , and tell Mrs. King that I can &apos;t come .
On the way get these things .
I &apos;ll put them down ; they &apos;ll be needed , and I must go prepared for <unk> .
Hospital stores are not always good .
Beth , go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine : I &apos;m not too proud to beg for father ; he shall have the best of everything .
Amy , tell Hannah to get down the black trunk ; and , Meg , come and help me find my things , for I &apos;m half bewildered . &quot;
<unk> , thinking , and <unk> , all at once , might well <unk> the poor lady , and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little while , and let them work .
Every one scattered like leaves before a <unk> of wind ; and the quiet , happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell .
Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth , bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid , and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mother &apos;s absence , which comforted her very much .
There was nothing he didn &apos;t offer , from his own dressing-gown to himself as escort .
But that last was impossible .
Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman &apos;s <unk> the long journey ; yet an expression of relief was <unk> when he spoke of it , for anxiety ill fits one for travelling .
He saw the look , knit his heavy eyebrows , rubbed his hands , and marched abruptly away , saying he &apos;d be back directly .
No one had time to think of him again till , as Meg ran through the entry , with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other , she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke .
&#91; Illustration : She came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke &#93; &quot; I &apos;m very sorry to hear of this , Miss March , &quot; he said , in the kind , quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit .
&quot; I came to offer myself as escort to your mother .
Mr. Laurence has <unk> for me in Washington , and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there . &quot;
Down dropped the rubbers , and the tea was very near following , as Meg put out her hand , with a face so full of gratitude , that Mr. Brooke would have felt <unk> for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to make .
&quot; How kind you all are !
Mother will accept , I &apos;m sure ; and it will be such a relief to know that she has some one to take care of her .
Thank you very , very much ! &quot;
Meg spoke earnestly , and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the <unk> tea , and lead the way into the parlor , saying she would call her mother .
Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from Aunt March , <unk> the desired sum , and a few lines repeating what she had often said before , --that she had always told them it was absurd for March to go into the army , always <unk> that no good would come of it , and she hoped they would take her advice next time .
Mrs. March put the note in the fire , the money in her purse , and went on with her preparations , with her lips folded tightly , in a way which Jo would have understood if she had been there .
The short afternoon wore away ; all the other errands were done , and Meg and her mother busy at some necessary needle-work , while Beth and Amy got tea , and Hannah finished her <unk> with what she called a &quot; slap and a bang , &quot; but still Jo did not come .
They began to get anxious ; and Laurie went off to find her , for no one ever knew what <unk> Jo might take into her head .
He missed her , however , and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance , for there was a mixture of fun and fear , satisfaction and regret , in it , which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother , saying , with a little choke in her voice , &quot; That &apos;s my <unk> towards making father comfortable and bringing him home ! &quot;
&quot; My dear , where did you get it ?
<unk> dollars !
Jo , I hope you haven &apos;t done anything rash ?
&quot; No , it &apos;s mine honestly ; I didn &apos;t beg , borrow , or steal it .
I earned it ; and I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll blame me , for I only sold what was my own . &quot;
As she spoke , Jo took off her bonnet , and a general <unk> arose , for all her <unk> hair was cut short .
&quot; Your hair !
Your beautiful hair ! &quot;
&quot; O Jo , how could you ?
Your one beauty . &quot;
&quot; My dear girl , there was no need of this . &quot;
&quot; She doesn &apos;t look like my Jo any more , but I love her dearly for it ! &quot;
As every one exclaimed , and Beth hugged the <unk> head tenderly , Jo assumed an indifferent air , which did not deceive any one a particle , and said , rumpling up the brown <unk> , and trying to look as if she liked it , &quot; It doesn &apos;t affect the fate of the nation , so don &apos;t <unk> , Beth .
It will be good for my vanity ; I was getting too proud of my wig .
It will do my <unk> good to have that mop taken off ; my head feels <unk> light and cool , and the <unk> said I could soon have a curly crop , which will be boyish , becoming , and easy to keep in order .
I &apos;m satisfied ; so please take the money , and let &apos;s have supper . &quot;
&quot; Tell me all about it , Jo .
_ I _ am not quite satisfied , but I can &apos;t blame you , for I know how <unk> you sacrificed your vanity , as you call it , to your love .
But , my dear , it was not necessary , and I &apos;m afraid you will regret it , one of these days , &quot; said Mrs. March .
&quot; No , I won &apos;t ! &quot;
returned Jo stoutly , feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely <unk> .
&quot; What made you do it ? &quot;
asked Amy , who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair .
&quot; Well , I was wild to do something for father , &quot; replied Jo , as they gathered about the table , for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble .
&quot; I hate to borrow as much as mother does , and I knew Aunt March would croak ; she always does , if you ask for a <unk> .
Meg gave all her <unk> salary toward the <unk> , and I only got some clothes with mine , so I felt wicked , and was bound to have some money , if I sold the nose off my face to get it . &quot;
&quot; You needn &apos;t feel wicked , my child : you had no winter things , and got the <unk> with your own hard earnings , &quot; said Mrs. March , with a look that warmed Jo &apos;s heart .
&quot; I hadn &apos;t the least idea of selling my hair at first , but as I went along I kept thinking what I could do , and feeling as if I &apos;d like to <unk> into some of the rich stores and help myself .
In a <unk> &apos;s window I saw <unk> of hair with the <unk> marked ; and one black tail , not so thick as mine , was forty dollars .
It came over me all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out of , and without stopping to think , I walked in , asked if they bought hair , and what they would give for mine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see how you dared to do it , &quot; said Beth , in a tone of <unk> .
&quot; Oh , he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to <unk> his hair .
He rather stared , at first , as if he wasn &apos;t used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair .
He said he didn &apos;t care about mine , it wasn &apos;t the fashionable color , and he never paid much for it in the first place ; the work put into it made it dear , and so on .
It was getting late , and I was afraid , if it wasn &apos;t done right away , that I shouldn &apos;t have it done at all , and you know when I start to do a thing , I hate to give it up ; so I begged him to take it , and told him why I was in such a hurry .
It was silly , I dare say , but it changed his mind , for I got rather excited , and told the story in my topsy-turvy way , and his wife heard , and said so kindly , -- &quot; &apos; Take it , <unk> , and <unk> the young lady ; I &apos;d do as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a <unk> of hair worth selling . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Who was Jimmy ? &quot;
asked Amy , who liked to have things explained as they went along .
&quot; Her son , she said , who was in the army .
How friendly such things make strangers feel , don &apos;t they ?
She talked away all the time the man clipped , and diverted my mind nicely . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : The man clipped &#93; &quot; Didn &apos;t you feel dreadfully when the first cut came ? &quot;
asked Meg , with a shiver .
&quot; I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things , and that was the end of it .
I never <unk> over trifles like that ; I will confess , though , I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on the table , and felt only the short , rough ends on my head .
It almost seemed as if I &apos;d an arm or a leg off .
The woman saw me look at it , and picked out a long lock for me to keep .
I &apos;ll give it to you , Marmee , just to remember past glories by ; for a crop is so comfortable I don &apos;t think I shall ever have a mane again . &quot;
Mrs. March folded the <unk> , chestnut lock , and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk .
She only said &quot; Thank you , deary , &quot; but something in her face made the girls change the subject , and talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke &apos;s kindness , the prospect of a fine day to-morrow , and the happy times they would have when father came home to be nursed .
No one wanted to go to bed , when , at ten o &apos;clock , Mrs. March put by the last finished <unk> , and said , &quot; Come , girls . &quot;
Beth went to the piano and played the father &apos;s favorite hymn ; all began bravely , but broke down one by one , till Beth was left alone , singing with all her heart , for to her music was always a sweet <unk> .
&quot; Go to bed and don &apos;t talk , for we must be up early , and shall need all the sleep we can get .
Good-night , my <unk> , &quot; said Mrs. March , as the hymn ended , for no one cared to try another .
They kissed her quietly , and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room .
Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble , but Meg lay awake , thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life .
Jo lay motionless , and her sister fancied that she was asleep , till a <unk> sob made her exclaim , as she touched a wet cheek , -- &quot; Jo , dear , what is it ?
Are you crying about father ? &quot;
&quot; No , not now . &quot;
&quot; What then ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> hair ! &quot;
burst out poor Jo , trying <unk> to <unk> her emotion in the pillow .
It did not sound at all comical to Meg , who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner .
&quot; I &apos;m not sorry , &quot; <unk> Jo , with a choke .
&quot; I &apos;d do it again to-morrow , if I could .
It &apos;s only the vain , selfish part of me that goes and <unk> in this silly way .
Don &apos;t tell any one , it &apos;s all over now .
I thought you were asleep , so I just made a little private moan for my one beauty .
How came you to be awake ? &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t sleep , I &apos;m so anxious , &quot; said Meg .
&quot; <unk> about something pleasant , and you &apos;ll soon drop off . &quot;
&quot; I tried it , but felt <unk> awake than ever . &quot;
&quot; What did you think of ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> faces , <unk> particularly , &quot; answered Meg , smiling to herself , in the dark .
&quot; What color do you like best ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> is , sometimes ; blue are lovely . &quot;
Jo laughed , and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk , then <unk> promised to make her hair curl , and fell asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air .
The <unk> were striking midnight , and the rooms were very still , as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed , smoothing a <unk> here , settling a pillow there , and pausing to look long and tenderly at each unconscious face , to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed , and to pray the <unk> prayers which only mothers utter .
As she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night , the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds , and shone upon her like a bright , benignant face , which seemed to whisper in the silence , &quot; Be comforted , dear soul !
There is always light behind the clouds . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : Letters &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
In the cold gray dawn the sisters <unk> their lamp , and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before ; for now the shadow of a real trouble had come , the little books were full of help and comfort ; and , as they dressed , they agreed to say good-by cheerfully and hopefully , and send their mother on her anxious journey <unk> by tears or <unk> from them .
Everything seemed very strange when they went down , --so dim and still outside , so full of light and bustle within .
<unk> at that early hour seemed odd , and even Hannah &apos;s familiar face looked <unk> as she flew about her kitchen with her <unk> on .
The big trunk stood ready in the hall , mother &apos;s cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa , and mother herself sat trying to eat , but looking so pale and worn with <unk> and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution .
Meg &apos;s eyes kept filling in spite of herself ; Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen <unk> more than once ; and the little girls &apos; wore a grave , troubled expression , as if sorrow was a new experience to them .
Nobody talked much , but as the time drew very near , and they sat waiting for the carriage , Mrs. March said to the girls , who were all <unk> about her , one folding her shawl , another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet , a third putting on her <unk> , and a fourth <unk> up her travelling bag , -- &quot; Children , I leave you to Hannah &apos;s care and Mr. Laurence &apos;s protection .
Hannah is <unk> itself , and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own .
I have no fears for you , yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly .
Don &apos;t <unk> and fret when I am gone , or think that you can comfort <unk> by being idle and trying to forget .
Go on with your work as usual , for work is a blessed solace .
Hope and keep busy ; and whatever happens , remember that you never can be <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Yes , mother . &quot;
&quot; Meg , dear , be prudent , watch over your sisters , consult Hannah , and , in any <unk> , go to Mr. Laurence .
Be patient , Jo , don &apos;t get despondent or do rash things ; write to me often , and be my brave girl , ready to help and cheer us all .
Beth , comfort yourself with your music , and be faithful to the little home duties ; and you , Amy , help all you can , be <unk> , and keep happy safe at home . &quot;
&quot; We will , mother !
we will ! &quot;
The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen .
That was the hard minute , but the girls stood it well : no one cried , no one ran away or uttered a <unk> , though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to father , remembering , as they spoke , that it might be too late to deliver them .
They kissed their mother quietly , clung about her tenderly , and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away .
Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off , and Mr. Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls <unk> him &quot; Mr. <unk> &quot; on the spot .
&quot; Good-by , my <unk> !
God bless and keep us all ! &quot;
whispered Mrs. March , as she kissed one dear little face after the other , and hurried into the carriage .
As she rolled away , the sun came out , and , looking back , she saw it shining on the group at the gate , like a good omen .
They saw it also , and smiled and waved their hands ; and the last thing she beheld , as she turned the corner , was the four bright faces , and behind them , like a <unk> , old Mr. Laurence , faithful Hannah , and devoted Laurie .
&#91; Illustration : She rolled away &#93; &quot; How kind every one is to us ! &quot;
she said , turning to find fresh <unk> of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man &apos;s face .
&quot; I don &apos;t see how they can help it , &quot; returned Mr. Brooke , laughing so <unk> that Mrs. March could not help smiling ; and so the long journey began with the good omens of sunshine , smiles , and cheerful words .
&quot; I feel as if there had been an earthquake , &quot; said Jo , as their neighbors went home to breakfast , leaving them to rest and refresh themselves .
&quot; It seems as if half the house was gone , &quot; added Meg forlornly .
Beth opened her lips to say something , but could only point to the pile of <unk> <unk> which lay on mother &apos;s table , showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them .
It was a little thing , but it went straight to their hearts ; and , in spite of their brave resolutions , they all broke down , and cried bitterly .
Hannah wisely allowed them to <unk> their feelings , and , when the shower showed signs of <unk> up , she came to the rescue , armed with a coffee-pot .
&quot; Now , my dear young ladies , remember what your ma said , and don &apos;t fret .
Come and have a cup of coffee all round , and then let &apos;s fall to work , and be a credit to the family . &quot;
<unk> was a treat , and Hannah showed great tact in making it that morning .
No one could resist her persuasive nods , or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee-pot .
They drew up to the table , exchanged their handkerchiefs for <unk> , and in ten minutes were all right again .
&quot; &apos; Hope and keep busy ; &apos; that &apos;s the motto for us , so let &apos;s see who will remember it best .
I shall go to Aunt March , as usual .
Oh , won &apos;t she lecture though ! &quot;
said Jo , as she <unk> with returning spirit .
&quot; I shall go to my Kings , though I &apos;d much rather stay at home and attend to things here , &quot; said Meg , wishing she hadn &apos;t made her eyes so red .
&quot; No need of that ; Beth and I can keep house perfectly well , &quot; put in Amy , with an important air .
&quot; Hannah will tell us what to do ; and we &apos;ll have everything nice when you come home , &quot; added Beth , getting out her mop and <unk> without delay .
&quot; I think anxiety is very interesting , &quot; observed Amy , eating sugar , <unk> .
The girls couldn &apos;t help laughing , and felt better for it , though Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a <unk> .
The sight of the turn-overs made Jo sober again ; and when the two went out to their daily tasks , they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother &apos;s face .
It was gone ; but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony , and there she was , nodding away at them like a <unk> <unk> .
&quot; That &apos;s so like my Beth ! &quot;
said Jo , waving her hat , with a grateful face .
&quot; Good-by , <unk> ; I hope the Kings won &apos;t train to-day .
Don &apos;t fret about father , dear , &quot; she added , as they parted .
&quot; And I hope Aunt March won &apos;t croak .
Your hair _ is _ becoming , and it looks very boyish and nice , &quot; returned Meg , trying not to smile at the curly head , which looked <unk> small on her tall sister &apos;s shoulders .
&quot; That &apos;s my only comfort ; &quot; and , touching her hat _ ?
la _ Laurie , away went Jo , feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day .
<unk> from their father comforted the girls very much ; for , though <unk> ill , the presence of the best and tenderest of <unk> had already done him good .
Mr. Brooke sent a <unk> every day , and , as the head of the family , Meg insisted on reading the <unk> , which grew more and more cheering as the week passed .
At first , every one was eager to write , and plump <unk> were carefully poked into the <unk> by one or other of the sisters , who felt rather important with their Washington <unk> .
As one of these <unk> contained characteristic notes from the party , we will <unk> an imaginary mail , and read them : -- &quot; MY DEAREST MOTHER , -- &quot; It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us , for the news was so good we couldn &apos;t help laughing and crying over it .
How very kind Mr. Brooke is , and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence &apos;s business <unk> him near you so long , since he is so useful to you and father .
The girls are all as good as gold .
Jo helps me with the sewing , and <unk> on doing all sorts of hard <unk> .
I should be afraid she might <unk> , if I didn &apos;t know that her &apos; moral fit &apos; wouldn &apos;t last long .
Beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock , and never forgets what you told her .
She <unk> about father , and looks sober except when she is at her little piano .
Amy minds me nicely , and I take great care of her .
She does her own hair , and I am teaching her to make button-holes and mend her stockings .
She tries very hard , and I know you will be pleased with her <unk> when you come .
Mr. Laurence watches over us like a motherly old <unk> , as Jo says ; and Laurie is very kind and neighborly .
He and Jo keep us merry , for we get pretty blue sometimes , and feel like <unk> , with you so far away .
Hannah is a perfect saint ; she does not scold at all , and always calls me Miss &apos; Margaret , &apos; which is quite proper , you know , and <unk> me with respect .
We are all well and busy ; but we long , day and night , to have you back .
Give my dearest love to father , and believe me , ever your own &quot; MEG . &quot;
This note , prettily written on <unk> paper , was a great contrast to the next , which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper , <unk> with <unk> and all manner of <unk> and <unk> letters : -- &quot; MY <unk> <unk> , -- &quot; Three cheers for dear father !
Brooke was a trump to telegraph right off , and let us know the minute he was better .
I rushed up garret when the letter came , and tried to thank God for being so good to us ; but I could only cry , and say , &apos; I &apos;m glad !
I &apos;m glad ! &apos;
Didn &apos;t that do as well as a regular prayer ?
for I felt a great many in my heart .
We have such funny times ; and now I can enjoy them , for every one is so desperately good , it &apos;s like living in a nest of turtle-doves .
You &apos;d laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be <unk> .
She gets prettier every day , and I &apos;m in love with her sometimes .
The children are regular <unk> , and <unk> , I &apos;m Jo , and never shall be anything else .
Oh , I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie .
I <unk> my mind about a silly little thing , and he was offended .
I was right , but didn &apos;t speak as I ought , and he marched home , saying he wouldn &apos;t come again till I begged pardon .
I declared I wouldn &apos;t , and got mad .
It lasted all day ; I felt bad , and wanted you very much .
Laurie and I are both so proud , it &apos;s hard to beg pardon ; but I thought he &apos;d come to it , for I _ was _ in the right .
He didn &apos;t come ; and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river .
I read my little book , felt better , resolved not to let the sun set on _ my _ anger , and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry .
I met him at the gate , coming for the same thing .
We both laughed , begged each other &apos;s pardon , and felt all good and comfortable again .
&quot; I made a &apos; <unk> &apos; yesterday , when I was helping Hannah wash ; and , as father likes my silly little things , I put it in to amuse him .
Give him the <unk> hug that ever was , and kiss yourself a dozen times for your &quot; <unk> JO . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> <unk> THE <unk> .
&quot; Queen of my tub , I merrily sing , While the white <unk> <unk> high ; And <unk> wash and <unk> and <unk> , And <unk> the clothes to dry ; Then out in the free fresh air they swing , Under the sunny sky .
&quot; I wish we could wash from our hearts and souls The <unk> of the week away , And let water and air by their magic make <unk> as <unk> as they ; Then on the earth there would be indeed A glorious <unk> !
&quot; Along the path of a useful life , Will heart <unk> ever bloom ; The busy mind has no time to think Of sorrow or care or gloom ; And anxious thoughts may be swept away , As we bravely <unk> a broom .
&quot; I am glad a task to me is given , To labor at day by day ; For it brings me health and strength and hope , And I cheerfully learn to say , -- &apos; <unk> , you may think , Heart , you may feel , But , <unk> , you shall work <unk> ! &apos; &quot;
&quot; DEAR MOTHER , -- &quot; There is only room for me to send my love , and some pressed pansies from the <unk> I have been keeping safe in the house for father to see .
I read every morning , try to be good all day , and sing myself to sleep with father &apos;s tune .
I can &apos;t sing &apos; <unk> of the <unk> &apos; now ; it makes me cry .
Every one is very kind , and we are as happy as we can be without you .
Amy wants the rest of the page , so I must stop .
I didn &apos;t forget to cover the <unk> , and I wind the clock and air the rooms every day .
&quot; Kiss dear father on the cheek he calls mine .
Oh , do come soon to your loving &quot; LITTLE BETH . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : I wind the clock &#93; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , -- &quot; We are all well I do my lessons always and never <unk> the <unk> says I mean <unk> so I put in both words and you can take the <unk> .
Meg is a great comfort to me and lets me have jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo says because it keeps me sweet <unk> .
Laurie is not as <unk> as he ought to be now I am almost in my teens , he calls me <unk> and <unk> my feelings by talking French to me very fast when I say <unk> or <unk> <unk> as <unk> King does .
The <unk> of my blue dress were all worn out , and Meg put in new ones , but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than the dress .
I felt bad but did not fret I bear my troubles well but I do wish Hannah would put more <unk> in my <unk> and have <unk> every day .
Can &apos;t she ?
Didn &apos;t I make that <unk> point nice ?
Meg says my <unk> and spelling are <unk> and I am <unk> but dear me I have so many things to do , I can &apos;t stop .
<unk> , I send heaps of love to <unk> .
&quot; Your affectionate daughter , &quot; AMY <unk> MARCH . &quot;
&quot; DEAR <unk> MARCH , -- &quot; I <unk> drop a line to say we <unk> on <unk> rate .
The girls is clever and fly round right smart .
Miss Meg is going to make a proper good housekeeper ; she <unk> the liking for it , and <unk> the hang of things <unk> quick .
Jo <unk> beat all for <unk> <unk> , but she don &apos;t stop to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and you never know where she &apos;s like to bring up .
She done out a tub of clothes on Monday , but she <unk> &apos; em <unk> they was <unk> , and <unk> a pink <unk> dress till I thought I should a died a <unk> .
Beth is the best of little <unk> , and a sight of help to me , <unk> so <unk> and <unk> .
She tries to learn everything , and really goes to market beyond her years ; likewise keeps accounts , with my help , quite wonderful .
We have got on very <unk> so <unk> ; I don &apos;t let the girls <unk> coffee only once a week , <unk> to your wish , and keep em on plain wholesome <unk> .
Amy does well about <unk> , <unk> her best clothes and <unk> sweet stuff .
Mr. Laurie is as full of <unk> as usual , and turns the house upside down frequent ; but he <unk> up the girls , and so I let em <unk> full swing .
The old gentleman sends heaps of things , and is rather <unk> , but means <unk> , and it <unk> my place to say <unk> .
My bread is <unk> , so no more at this time .
I send my duty to Mr. March , and hope he &apos;s seen the last of his <unk> .

&quot; DEAR <unk> , -- &quot; The little girls are all well ; Beth and my boy report daily ; Hannah is a model servant , and <unk> pretty Meg like a <unk> .

LITTLE <unk> .
For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood .
It was really <unk> , for every one seemed in a heavenly frame of mind , and self-denial was all the fashion .
<unk> of their first anxiety about their father , the girls <unk> relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little , and began to fall back into the old ways .
They did not forget their motto , but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier ; and after such tremendous exertions , they felt that <unk> deserved a holiday , and gave it a good many .
Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough , and was ordered to stay at home till she was better , for Aunt March didn &apos;t like to hear people read with <unk> in their heads .
Jo liked this , and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar , subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with <unk> and books .
Amy found that <unk> and art did not go well together , and returned to her mud pies .
Meg went daily to her pupils , and sewed , or thought she did , at home , but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother , or reading the Washington <unk> over and over .
Beth kept on , with only slight <unk> into <unk> or <unk> .
All the little duties were faithfully done each day , and many of her sisters &apos; also , for they were <unk> , and the house seemed like a clock whose <unk> was gone <unk> .
When her heart got heavy with <unk> for mother or fears for father , she went away into a certain closet , hid her face in the folds of a certain dear old gown , and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself .
Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit , but every one felt how sweet and helpful Beth was , and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs .
All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character ; and , when the first excitement was over , felt that they had done well , and deserved praise .
So they did ; but their mistake was in <unk> to do well , and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret .
&quot; Meg , I wish you &apos;d go and see the Hummels ; you know mother told us not to forget them , &quot; said Beth , ten days after Mrs. March &apos;s departure .
&quot; I &apos;m too tired to go this afternoon , &quot; replied Meg , rocking comfortably as she sewed .
&quot; Can &apos;t you , Jo ? &quot;
asked Beth .
&quot; Too stormy for me with my cold . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was almost well . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s well enough for me to go out with Laurie , but not well enough to go to the Hummels &apos; , &quot; said Jo , laughing , but looking a little ashamed of her <unk> .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you go yourself ? &quot;
asked Meg .
&quot; I _ have _ been every day , but the baby is sick , and I don &apos;t know what to do for it .
Mrs. Hummel goes away to work , and <unk> takes care of it ; but it gets sicker and sicker , and I think you or Hannah ought to go . &quot;
Beth spoke earnestly , and Meg promised she would go to-morrow .
&quot; <unk> Hannah for some nice little mess , and take it round , Beth ; the air will do you good , &quot; said Jo , adding <unk> , &quot; I &apos;d go , but I want to finish my writing . &quot;
&quot; My head aches and I &apos;m tired , so I thought may be some of you would go , &quot; said Beth .
&quot; Amy will be in presently , and she will run down for us , &quot; suggested Meg .
&quot; Well , I &apos;ll rest a little and wait for her . &quot;
So Beth lay down on the sofa , the others returned to their work , and the Hummels were forgotten .
An hour passed : Amy did not come ; Meg went to her room to try on a new dress ; Jo was absorbed in her story , and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire , when Beth quietly put on her hood , filled her basket with <unk> and ends for the poor children , and went out into the chilly air , with a heavy head , and a grieved look in her patient eyes .
It was late when she came back , and no one saw her <unk> upstairs and shut herself into her mother &apos;s room .
Half an hour after Jo went to &quot; mother &apos;s closet &quot; for something , and there found Beth sitting on the medicine chest , looking very grave , with red eyes , and a <unk> in her hand .
&quot; Christopher Columbus !
What &apos;s the matter ? &quot;
cried Jo , as Beth put out her hand as if to warn her off , and asked quickly , -- &quot; You &apos;ve had the scarlet fever , haven &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> ago , when Meg did .
Why ? &quot;
&quot; Then I &apos;ll tell you .
Oh , Jo , the baby &apos;s dead ! &quot;
&quot; What baby ? &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Hummel &apos;s ; it died in my lap before she got home , &quot; cried Beth , with a sob .
&quot; My poor dear , how dreadful for you !
I ought to have gone , &quot; said Jo , taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother &apos;s big chair , with a remorseful face .
&quot; It wasn &apos;t dreadful , Jo , only so sad !
I saw in a minute that it was sicker , but <unk> said her mother had gone for a doctor , so I took baby and let Lotty rest .
It seemed asleep , but all of a sudden it gave a little cry , and trembled , and then lay very still .
I tried to warm its feet , and Lotty gave it some milk , but it didn &apos;t stir , and I knew it was dead . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : It didn &apos;t stir , and I knew it was dead &#93; &quot; Don &apos;t cry , dear !
What did you do ? &quot;
&quot; I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor .
He said it was dead , and looked at <unk> and Minna , who have got sore <unk> .
<unk> fever , ma &apos;am .
<unk> to have called me before , &apos; he said crossly .
Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor , and had tried to cure baby herself , but now it was too late , and she could only ask him to help the others , and trust to charity for his pay .
He smiled then , and was kinder ; but it was very sad , and I cried with them till he turned round , all of a sudden , and told me to go home and take <unk> right away , or I &apos;d have the fever . &quot;
&quot; No , you won &apos;t ! &quot;
cried Jo , hugging her close , with a frightened look .
&quot; O Beth , if you should be sick I never could forgive myself !
What _ shall _ we do ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be frightened , I guess I <unk> &apos;t have it badly .
I looked in mother &apos;s book , and saw that it begins with headache , sore throat , and queer feelings like mine , so I did take some <unk> , and I feel better , &quot; said Beth , laying her cold hands on her hot forehead , and trying to look well .
&quot; If mother was only at home ! &quot;
exclaimed Jo , <unk> the book , and feeling that Washington was an immense way off .
She read a page , looked at Beth , felt her head , peeped into her throat , and then said gravely ; &quot; You &apos;ve been over the baby every day for more than a week , and among the others who are going to have it ; so I &apos;m afraid _ you _ are going to have it , Beth .
I &apos;ll call Hannah , she knows all about <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t let Amy come ; she never had it , and I should hate to give it to her .
Can &apos;t you and Meg have it over again ? &quot;
asked Beth , anxiously .
&quot; I guess not ; don &apos;t care if I do ; serve me right , selfish <unk> , to let you go , and stay writing rubbish myself ! &quot;
muttered Jo , as she went to consult Hannah .
The good soul was wide awake in a minute , and took the lead at once , <unk> Jo that there was no need to worry ; every one had scarlet fever , and , if rightly treated , nobody died , --all of which Jo believed , and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg .
&quot; Now I &apos;ll tell you what we &apos;ll do , &quot; said Hannah , when she had examined and <unk> Beth ; &quot; we will have Dr. Bangs , just to take a look at you , dear , and see that we start right ; then we &apos;ll send Amy off to Aunt March &apos;s , for a spell , to keep her out of harm &apos;s way , and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two . &quot;
&quot; I shall stay , of course ; I &apos;m oldest , &quot; began Meg , looking anxious and <unk> .
&quot; _ I _ shall , because it &apos;s my fault she is sick ; I told mother I &apos;d do the errands , and I haven &apos;t , &quot; said Jo decidedly .
&quot; Which will you have , Beth ?
there ain &apos;t no need of but one , &quot; said Hannah .
&quot; Jo , please ; &quot; and Beth leaned her head against her sister , with a contented look , which effectually settled that point .
&quot; I &apos;ll go and tell Amy , &quot; said Meg , feeling a little hurt , yet rather relieved , on the whole , for she did not like <unk> , and Jo did .
Amy rebelled outright , and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to Aunt March .
Meg <unk> , pleaded , and commanded : all in vain .
Amy <unk> that she would _ not _ go ; and Meg left her in despair , to ask Hannah what should be done .
Before she came back , Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing , with her head in the <unk> .
She told her story , expecting to be consoled ; but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room , <unk> softly , as he knit his brows in deep thought .
Presently he sat down beside her , and said , in his most wheedlesome tone , &quot; Now be a sensible little woman , and do as they say .
No , don &apos;t cry , but hear what a jolly plan I &apos;ve got .
You go to Aunt March &apos;s , and I &apos;ll come and take you out every day , <unk> or walking , and we &apos;ll have capital times .
Won &apos;t that be better than <unk> here ? &quot;
&#91; Illustration : He sat down beside her &#93; &quot; I don &apos;t wish to be sent off as if I was in the way , &quot; began Amy , in an injured voice .
&quot; Bless your heart , child , it &apos;s to keep you well .
You don &apos;t want to be sick , do you ? &quot;
&quot; No , I &apos;m sure I don &apos;t ; but I dare say I shall be , for I &apos;ve been with Beth all the time . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s the very reason you ought to go away at once , so that you may escape it .
<unk> of air and care will keep you well , I dare say ; or , if it does not entirely , you will have the fever more lightly .
I advise you to be off as soon as you can , for scarlet fever is no joke , miss . &quot;
&quot; But it &apos;s dull at Aunt March &apos;s , and she is so cross , &quot; said Amy , looking rather frightened .
&quot; It won &apos;t be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is , and take you out <unk> .
The old lady likes me , and I &apos;ll be as sweet as possible to her , so she won &apos;t peck at us , whatever we do . &quot;
&quot; Will you take me out in the trotting <unk> with <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; On my honor as a gentleman . &quot;
&quot; And come every single day ? &quot;
&quot; See if I don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; And bring me back the minute Beth is well ? &quot;
&quot; The <unk> minute . &quot;
&quot; And go to the theatre , truly ? &quot;
&quot; A dozen theatres , if we may . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> will , &quot; said Amy slowly .
&quot; Good girl !
<unk> Meg , and tell her you &apos;ll give in , &quot; said Laurie , with an approving pat , which <unk> Amy more than the &quot; giving in . &quot;
Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought ; and Amy , feeling very precious and <unk> , promised to go , if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill . &quot; How is the little dear ? &quot;
asked Laurie ; for Beth was his especial pet , and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show .
&quot; She is lying down on mother &apos;s bed , and feels better .
The baby &apos;s death troubled her , but I dare say she has only got cold .
Hannah _ says _ she thinks so ; but she _ looks _ worried , and that makes me fidgety , &quot; answered Meg .
&quot; What a trying world it is ! &quot;
said Jo , rumpling up her hair in a <unk> sort of way .
&quot; No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another .
There doesn &apos;t seem to be anything to hold on to when mother &apos;s gone ; so I &apos;m all at sea . &quot;
&quot; Well , don &apos;t make a <unk> of yourself , it isn &apos;t becoming .
<unk> your wig , Jo , and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother , or do anything ? &quot;
asked Laurie , who never had been <unk> to the loss of his friend &apos;s one beauty .
&quot; That is what troubles me , &quot; said Meg .
&quot; I think we ought to tell her if Beth is really ill , but Hannah says we mustn &apos;t , for mother can &apos;t leave father , and it will only make them anxious .
Beth won &apos;t be sick long , and Hannah knows just what to do , and mother said we were to mind her , so I suppose we must , but it doesn &apos;t seem quite right to me . &quot;
&quot; Hum , well , I can &apos;t say ; suppose you ask grandfather after the doctor has been . &quot;
&quot; We will .
Jo , go and get Dr. Bangs at once , &quot; commanded Meg ; &quot; we can &apos;t decide anything till he has been . &quot;
&quot; <unk> where you are , Jo ; I &apos;m <unk> to this establishment , &quot; said Laurie , taking up his cap .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid you are busy , &quot; began Meg .
&quot; No , I &apos;ve done my lessons for the day . &quot;
&quot; Do you study in vacation time ? &quot;
asked Jo .
&quot; I follow the good example my neighbors set me , &quot; was Laurie &apos;s answer , as he swung himself out of the room .
&quot; I have great hopes of my boy , &quot; observed Jo , watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile .
&quot; He does very <unk> a boy , &quot; was Meg &apos;s somewhat <unk> answer , for the subject did not interest her .
Dr. Bangs came , said Beth had <unk> of the fever , but thought she would have it lightly , though he looked sober over the Hummel story .
Amy was ordered off at once , and provided with something to <unk> off danger , she departed in great state , with Jo and Laurie as escort .
Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality .
&quot; What do you want now ? &quot;
she asked , looking sharply over her spectacles , while the parrot , sitting on the back of her chair , called out , -- &#91; Illustration : What do you want now ? &#93;
&quot; Go away .
No boys allowed here . &quot;
Laurie retired to the window , and Jo told her story .
&quot; No more than I expected , if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks .
Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn &apos;t sick , which I &apos;ve no doubt she will be , <unk> like it now .
Don &apos;t cry , child , it worries me to hear people sniff . &quot;
Amy _ was _ on the point of crying , but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot &apos;s tail , which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak , and call out , -- &quot; Bless my boots ! &quot;
in such a funny way , that she laughed instead .
&quot; What do you hear from your mother ? &quot;
asked the old lady gruffly .
&quot; Father is much better , &quot; replied Jo , trying to keep sober .
&quot; Oh , is he ?
Well , that won &apos;t last long , I fancy ; March never had any <unk> , &quot; was the cheerful reply .
&quot; Ha , ha !
never say die , take a pinch of <unk> , good by , good by ! &quot;
<unk> Polly , dancing on her perch , and <unk> at the old lady &apos;s cap as Laurie tweaked him in the <unk> .
&quot; Hold your tongue , you <unk> old bird !
and , Jo , you &apos;d better go at once ; it isn &apos;t proper to be <unk> about so late with a <unk> boy <unk> &quot; &quot; Hold your tongue , you <unk> old bird ! &quot;
cried Polly , tumbling off the chair with a bounce , and running to peck the &quot; <unk> &quot; boy , who was shaking with laughter at the last speech .
&quot; I don &apos;t think I _ can _ bear it , but I &apos;ll try , &quot; thought Amy , as she was left alone with Aunt March .
&quot; Get along , you fright ! &quot;
screamed Polly ; and at that rude speech Amy could not restrain a sniff .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : Beth did have the fever &#93; Beth did have the fever , and was much sicker than any one but Hannah and the doctor suspected .
The girls knew nothing about illness , and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her , so Hannah had everything all her own way , and busy Dr. Bangs did his best , but left a good deal to the excellent nurse .
Meg stayed at home , lest she should <unk> the Kings , and kept house , feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of Beth &apos;s illness .
She could not think it right to deceive her mother , but she had been <unk> to mind Hannah , and Hannah wouldn &apos;t hear of &quot; Mrs. March <unk> &apos; told , and worried just for <unk> a trifle . &quot;
Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night ; not a hard task , for Beth was very patient , and bore her pain <unk> as long as she could control herself .
But there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a <unk> , broken voice , to play on the <unk> , as if on her beloved little piano , and try to sing with a throat so <unk> that there was no music left ; a time when she did not know the familiar faces round her , but addressed them by wrong names , and called imploringly for her mother .
Then Jo grew frightened , Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth , and even Hannah said she &quot; would think of it , though there was no danger _ yet _ . &quot;
A letter from Washington added to their trouble , for Mr. March had had a <unk> , and could not think of coming home for a long while .
How dark the days seemed now , how sad and lonely the house , and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited , while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home !
Then it was that Margaret , sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work , felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any <unk> money could buy , <unk> love , protection , peace , and health , the real blessings of life .
Then it was that Jo , living in the darkened room , with that suffering little sister always before her eyes , and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears , learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of Beth &apos;s nature , to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts , and to <unk> the worth of Beth &apos;s unselfish ambition , to live for others , and make home happy by the exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess , and which all should love and value more than talent , wealth , or beauty .
And Amy , in her <unk> , longed eagerly to be at home , that she might work for Beth , feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome , and remembering , with <unk> grief , how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her .
Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost , and Mr. Laurence locked the grand piano , because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him .
Every one missed Beth .
The <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and butcher inquired how she did ; poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her <unk> , and to get a shroud for Minna ; the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes , and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little Beth had made .
<unk> she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side , for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn _ <unk> ? <unk> ? _ .
She longed for her cats , but would not have them brought , lest they should get sick ; and , in her quiet hours , she was full of anxiety about Jo .
She sent loving messages to Amy , bade them tell her mother that she would write soon ; and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word , that father might not think she had neglected him .
But soon even these <unk> of consciousness ended , and she lay hour after hour , tossing to and fro , with <unk> words on her lips , or <unk> into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment .
Dr. Bangs came twice a day , Hannah sat up at night , Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute , and Jo never stirred from Beth &apos;s side .
The first of <unk> was a wintry day indeed to them , for a bitter wind blew , snow fell fast , and the year seemed getting ready for its death .
When Dr. Bangs came that morning , he looked long at Beth , held the hot hand in both his own a minute , and laid it gently down , saying , in a low tone , to Hannah , -- &quot; If Mrs. March _ can _ leave her husband , she &apos;d better be sent for . &quot;
Hannah nodded without speaking , for her lips <unk> nervously ; Meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words ; and Jo , after standing with a pale face for a minute , ran to the parlor , snatched up the telegram , and , throwing on her things , rushed out into the storm .
She was soon back , and , while noiselessly taking off her cloak , Laurie came in with a letter , saying that Mr. March was mending again .
Jo read it <unk> , but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart , and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly , -- &quot; What is it ?
is Beth worse ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve sent for mother , &quot; said Jo , <unk> at her rubber boots with a tragical expression .
&quot; Good for you , Jo !
Did you do it on your own <unk> ? &quot;
asked Laurie , as he seated her in the hall chair , and took off the rebellious boots , seeing how her hands shook .
&quot; No , the doctor told us to . &quot;
&quot; O Jo , it &apos;s not so bad as that ? &quot;
cried Laurie , with a startled face .
&quot; Yes , it is ; she doesn &apos;t know us , she doesn &apos;t even talk about the <unk> of green <unk> , as she calls the <unk> on the wall ; she doesn &apos;t look like my Beth , and there &apos;s nobody to help us bear it ; mother and father both gone , and God seems so far away I can &apos;t find Him . &quot;
As the tears <unk> fast down poor Jo &apos;s cheeks , she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way , as if <unk> in the dark , and Laurie took it in his , whispering , as well as he could , with a <unk> in his throat , -- &quot; I &apos;m here .
Hold on to me , Jo , dear ! &quot;
She could not speak , but she did &quot; hold on , &quot; and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart , and seemed to lead her nearer to the <unk> arm which alone could <unk> her in her trouble .
Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable , but no fitting words came to him , so he stood silent , gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do .
It was the best thing he could have done ; far more soothing than the most eloquent words , for Jo felt the <unk> sympathy , and , in the silence , learned the sweet solace which affection <unk> to sorrow .
Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her , and looked up with a grateful face .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> stroking her head as her mother used to do &#93; &quot; Thank you , Teddy , I &apos;m better now ; I don &apos;t feel so forlorn , and will try to bear it if it comes . &quot;
&quot; Keep hoping for the best ; that will help you , Jo .
Soon your mother will be here , and then everything will be right . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m so glad father is better ; now she won &apos;t feel so bad about leaving him .
Oh , me !
it does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap , and I got the <unk> part on my shoulders , &quot; sighed Jo , <unk> her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry .
&quot; Doesn &apos;t Meg pull fair ? &quot;
asked Laurie , looking indignant .
&quot; Oh , yes ; she tries to , but she can &apos;t love Bethy as I do ; and she won &apos;t miss her as I shall .
Beth is my conscience , and I _ can &apos;t _ give her up .
I can &apos;t !
I can &apos;t ! &quot;
Down went Jo &apos;s face into the wet handkerchief , and she cried despairingly ; for she had kept up bravely till now , and never shed a tear .
Laurie drew his hand across his eyes , but could not speak till he had subdued the <unk> feeling in his throat and <unk> his lips .
It might be <unk> , but he couldn &apos;t help it , and I am glad of it .
Presently , as Jo &apos;s <unk> quieted , he said hopefully , &quot; I don &apos;t think she will die ; she &apos;s so good , and we all love her so much , I don &apos;t believe God will take her away yet . &quot;
&quot; The good and dear people always do die , &quot; groaned Jo , but she stopped crying , for her friend &apos;s words cheered her up , in spite of her own doubts and fears .
&quot; Poor girl , you &apos;re worn out .
It isn &apos;t like you to be forlorn .
Stop a bit ; I &apos;ll <unk> you up in a jiffy . &quot;
Laurie went off two stairs at a time , and Jo laid her wearied head down on Beth &apos;s little brown hood , which no one had thought of <unk> from the table where she left it .
It must have possessed some magic , for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo ; and , when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine , she took it with a smile , and said bravely , &quot; I <unk> to my Beth !
You are a good doctor , Teddy , and _ such _ a comfortable friend ; how can I ever pay you ? &quot;
she added , as the wine <unk> her body , as the kind words had done her troubled mind .
&quot; I &apos;ll send in my bill , by and by ; and to-night I &apos;ll give you something that will warm the <unk> of your heart better than quarts of wine , &quot; said Laurie , beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at something .
&quot; What is it ? &quot;
cried Jo , forgetting her <unk> for a minute , in her wonder .
&quot; I telegraphed to your mother yesterday , and Brooke answered she &apos;d come at once , and she &apos;ll be here to-night , and everything will be all right .
Aren &apos;t you glad I did it ? &quot;
Laurie spoke very fast , and turned red and excited all in a minute , for he had kept his plot a secret , for fear of <unk> the girls or <unk> Beth .
Jo grew quite white , flew out of her chair , and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck , and crying out , with a joyful cry , &quot; O Laurie !
O mother !
I _ am _ so glad ! &quot;
She did not weep again , but laughed <unk> , and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news .
Laurie , though decidedly amazed , behaved with great presence of mind ; he patted her back soothingly , and , finding that she was <unk> , followed it up by a bashful kiss or two , which brought Jo round at once .
Holding on to the banisters , she put him gently away , saying breathlessly , &quot; Oh , don &apos;t !
I didn &apos;t mean to ; it was dreadful of me ; but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn &apos;t help flying at you .
Tell me all about it , and don &apos;t give me wine again ; it makes me act so . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t mind , &quot; laughed Laurie , as he settled his tie .
&quot; Why , you see I got fidgety , and so did grandpa .
We thought Hannah was <unk> the <unk> business , and your mother ought to know .
She &apos;d never forgive us if <unk> , if anything happened , you know .
So I got grandpa to say it was high time we did something , and off I <unk> to the office yesterday , for the doctor looked sober , and Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram .
I never _ can _ bear to be &apos; <unk> over ; &apos; so that settled my mind , and I did it .
Your mother will come , I know , and the late train is in at two , <unk>
I shall go for her ; and you &apos;ve only got to bottle up your rapture , and keep Beth quiet , till that blessed lady gets here . &quot;
&quot; Laurie , you &apos;re an angel !
How shall I ever thank you ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> at me again ; I rather like it , &quot; said Laurie , looking mischievous , --a thing he had not done for a fortnight .
&quot; No , thank you .
I &apos;ll do it by <unk> , when your grandpa comes .
Don &apos;t tease , but go home and rest , for you &apos;ll be up half the night .
Bless you , Teddy , bless you ! &quot;
Jo had <unk> into a corner ; and , as she finished her speech , she vanished precipitately into the kitchen , where she sat down upon a <unk> , and told the assembled cats that she was &quot; happy , oh , _ so _ happy ! &quot;
while Laurie departed , feeling that he had made rather a neat thing of it .
&quot; That &apos;s the <unk> <unk> I ever see ; but I forgive him , and do hope Mrs. March is coming on right away , &quot; said Hannah , with an air of relief , when Jo told the good news .
Meg had a quiet rapture , and then <unk> over the letter , while Jo set the <unk> in order , and Hannah &quot; knocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected . &quot;
A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house , and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms .
Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change ; Beth &apos;s bird began to chirp again , and a <unk> rose was discovered on Amy &apos;s <unk> in the window ; the <unk> seemed to burn with unusual <unk> ; and every time the girls met , their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another , whispering <unk> , &quot; Mother &apos;s coming , dear !
mother &apos;s coming ! &quot;
Every one rejoiced but Beth ; she lay in that heavy <unk> , alike unconscious of hope and joy , doubt and danger .
It was a <unk> sight , --the once rosy face so changed and <unk> , the once busy hands so weak and wasted , the once smiling lips quite dumb , and the once pretty , well-kept hair scattered rough and <unk> on the pillow .
All day she lay so , only rousing now and then to <unk> , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
with lips so <unk> they could hardly shape the word ; all day Jo and Meg hovered over her , watching , waiting , hoping , and <unk> in God and mother ; and all day the snow fell , the bitter wind <unk> , and the hours dragged slowly by .
But night came at last ; and every time the clock struck , the sisters , still sitting on either side the bed , looked at each other with brightening eyes , for each hour brought help nearer .
The doctor had been in to say that some change , for better or worse , would probably take place about midnight , at which time he would return .
Hannah , quite worn out , lay down on the sofa at the bed &apos;s foot , and fell fast asleep ; Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor , feeling that he would rather face a rebel <unk> than Mrs. March &apos;s anxious countenance as she entered ; Laurie lay on the rug , pretending to rest , but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear .
The girls never forgot that night , for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch , with that dreadful sense of <unk> which comes to us in hours like those .
&quot; If God <unk> Beth I never will complain again , &quot; whispered Meg earnestly .
&quot; If God <unk> Beth I &apos;ll try to love and serve Him all my life , &quot; answered Jo , with equal <unk> .
&quot; I wish I had no heart , it aches so , &quot; sighed Meg , after a pause .
&quot; If life is often as hard as this , I don &apos;t see how we ever shall get through it , &quot; added her sister <unk> .
Here the clock struck twelve , and both forgot themselves in watching Beth , for they fancied a change passed over her <unk> face .
The house was still as death , and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep <unk> .
<unk> Hannah slept on , and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed .
An hour went by , and nothing happened except Laurie &apos;s quiet departure for the <unk> .
Another hour , <unk> no one came ; and anxious fears of delay in the storm , or accidents by the way , or , worst of all , a great grief at Washington , haunted the poor girls .
It was past two , when Jo , who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its <unk> of snow , heard a movement by the bed , and , turning quickly , saw Meg kneeling before their mother &apos;s easy-chair , with her face hidden .
A dreadful fear passed <unk> over Jo , as she thought , &quot; Beth is dead , and Meg is afraid to tell me . &quot;
She was back at her post in an instant , and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place .
The fever flush and the look of pain were gone , and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose , that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament .
<unk> low over this dearest of her sisters , she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips , and softly whispered , &quot; Good-by , my Beth ; good-by ! &quot;
As if waked by the stir , Hannah started out of her sleep , hurried to the bed , looked at Beth , felt her hands , listened at her lips , and then , throwing her apron over her head , sat down to <unk> to and fro , exclaiming , under her breath , &quot; The fever &apos;s turned ; she &apos;s <unk> &apos; <unk> <unk> ; her skin &apos;s damp , and she <unk> easy .
<unk> be given !
Oh , my goodness me ! &quot;
Before the girls could believe the happy truth , the doctor came to <unk> it .
He was a homely man , but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled , and said , with a fatherly look at them , &quot; Yes , my dears , I think the little girl will pull through this time .
Keep the house quiet ; let her sleep , and when she wakes , give <unk> &quot; What they were to give , neither heard ; for both crept into the dark hall , and , sitting on the stairs , held each other close , rejoicing with hearts too full for words .
When they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful Hannah , they found Beth lying , as she used to do , with her cheek <unk> on her hand , the dreadful <unk> gone , and <unk> quietly , as if just fallen asleep .
&quot; If mother would only come now ! &quot;
said Jo , as the winter night began to <unk> .
&quot; See , &quot; said Meg , coming up with a white , <unk> rose , &quot; I thought this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth &apos;s hand to-morrow if <unk> away from us .
But it has blossomed in the night , and now I mean to put it in my vase here , so that when the darling wakes , the first thing she sees will be the little rose , and mother &apos;s face . &quot;
Never had the sun <unk> so beautifully , and never had the world seemed so lovely , as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo , as they looked out in the early morning , when their long , sad <unk> was done .
&quot; It looks like a fairy world , &quot; said Meg , smiling to herself , as she stood behind the curtain , watching the <unk> sight .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
cried Jo , <unk> to her feet .
Yes , there was a sound of bells at the door below , a cry from Hannah , and then Laurie &apos;s voice saying , in a joyful whisper , &quot; Girls , she &apos;s come !
she &apos;s come ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Amy &apos;s Will &#93; <unk> .
AMY &apos;S WILL .
While these things were <unk> at home , Amy was having hard times at Aunt March &apos;s .
She felt her <unk> deeply , and , for the first time in her life , realized how much she was beloved and petted at home .
Aunt March never petted any one ; she did not approve of it ; but she meant to be kind , for the <unk> little girl pleased her very much , and Aunt March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew &apos;s children , though she didn &apos;t think proper to confess it .
She really did her best to make Amy happy , but , dear me , what mistakes she made !
Some old people keep young at heart in spite of <unk> and gray <unk> , can sympathize with children &apos;s little cares and joys , make them feel at home , and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays , giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way .
But Aunt March had not this gift , and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders , her prim ways , and long , <unk> talks .
<unk> the child more docile and amiable than her sister , the old lady felt it her duty to try and <unk> , as far as possible , the bad <unk> of home freedom and indulgence .
So she took Amy in hand , and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago , --a process which carried dismay to Amy &apos;s soul , and made her feel like a fly in the <unk> of a very <unk> spider .
&#91; Illustration : Polish up the spoons and the fat silver teapot &#93; She had to wash the cups every morning , and polish up the old-fashioned spoons , the fat silver teapot , and the glasses , till they shone .
Then she must dust the room , and what a trying <unk> that was !
Not a speck escaped Aunt March &apos;s eye , and all the furniture had <unk> legs , and much <unk> , which was never <unk> to suit .
Then Polly must be fed , the <unk> <unk> , and a dozen trips upstairs and down , to get things , or deliver orders , for the old lady was very lame , and seldom left her big chair .
After these <unk> labors , she must do her lessons , which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed .
Then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play , and didn &apos;t she enjoy it ?
Laurie came every day , and <unk> Aunt March , till Amy was allowed to go out with him , when they walked and rode , and had capital times .
After dinner , she had to read aloud , and sit still while the old lady slept , which she usually did for an hour , as she dropped off over the first page .
Then <unk> or <unk> appeared , and Amy sewed with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> till dusk , when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till <unk> .
The evenings were the worst of all , for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her youth , which were so <unk> dull that Amy was always ready to go to bed , intending to cry over her hard fate , but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two .
If it had not been for Laurie , and old Esther , the maid , she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time .
The parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted , for he soon felt that she did not admire him , and <unk> himself by being as mischievous as possible .
He pulled her hair whenever she came near him , upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage , made <unk> <unk> by pecking at him while Madam <unk> ; called her names before company , and behaved in all respects like a reprehensible old bird .
Then she could not <unk> the dog , --a fat , cross <unk> , who <unk> and <unk> at her when she made his <unk> , and who lay on his back , with all his legs in the air and a most <unk> expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat , which was about a dozen times a day .
The cook was <unk> , the old <unk> deaf , and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady .
&#91; Illustration : On his back , with all his legs in the air &#93; Esther was a Frenchwoman , who had lived with &quot; Madame , &quot; as she called her mistress , for many years , and who rather tyrannized over the old lady , who could not get along without her .
Her real name was <unk> , but Aunt March ordered her to change it , and she obeyed , on condition that she was never asked to change her religion .
She took a fancy to Mademoiselle , and amused her very much , with odd stories of her life in France , when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame &apos;s <unk> .
She also allowed her to <unk> about the great house , and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big <unk> and the ancient chests ; for Aunt March <unk> like a <unk> .
Amy &apos;s chief delight was an Indian <unk> , full of queer <unk> , little <unk> , and secret places , in which were kept all sorts of ornaments , some precious , some merely curious , all more or less antique .
To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction , especially the <unk> , in which , on velvet <unk> , reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago .
There was the <unk> set which Aunt March wore when she came out , the pearls her father gave her on her <unk> , her lover &apos;s diamonds , the <unk> <unk> rings and pins , the queer <unk> , with portraits of dead friends , and <unk> <unk> made of hair inside ; the baby <unk> her one little daughter had worn ; Uncle March &apos;s big watch , with the red seal so many childish hands had played with , and in a box , all by itself , lay Aunt March &apos;s <unk> , too small now for her fat finger , but put carefully away , like the most precious <unk> of them all .
&#91; Illustration : I should choose this &#93; &quot; Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will ? &quot;
asked Esther , who always sat near to watch over and lock up the <unk> .
&quot; I like the diamonds best , but there is no necklace among them , and I &apos;m fond of <unk> , they are so becoming .
I should choose this if I might , &quot; replied Amy , looking with great admiration at a string of gold and <unk> beads , from which hung a heavy cross of the same .
&quot; I , too , <unk> that , but not as a necklace ; <unk> , no !
to me it is a rosary , and as such I should use it like a good <unk> , &quot; said Esther , eying the handsome thing wistfully .
&quot; Is it meant to use as you use the string of <unk> wooden beads hanging over your glass ? &quot;
asked Amy .
&quot; Truly , yes , to pray with .
It would be pleasing to the <unk> if one used so fine a rosary as this , instead of wearing it as a vain <unk> . &quot;
&quot; You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers , Esther , and always come down looking quiet and satisfied .
I wish I could . &quot;
&quot; If Mademoiselle was a <unk> , she would find true comfort ; but , as that is not to be , it would be well if you went apart each day , to <unk> and pray , as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame .
She had a little chapel , and in it found <unk> for much trouble . &quot;
&quot; Would it be right for me to do so too ? &quot;
asked Amy , who , in her loneliness , felt the need of help of some sort , and found that she was apt to forget her little book , now that Beth was not there to remind her of it .
&quot; It would be excellent and charming ; and I shall gladly arrange the little <unk> for you if you like it .
Say nothing to Madame , but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts , and pray the dear God to preserve your sister . &quot;
Esther was truly <unk> , and quite sincere in her advice ; for she had an affectionate heart , and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety .
Amy liked the idea , and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room , hoping it would do her good .
&quot; I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March dies , &quot; she said , as she slowly replaced the shining rosary , and shut the <unk> one by one .
&quot; To you and your sisters .
I know it ; Madame <unk> in me ; I <unk> her will , and it is to be so , &quot; whispered Esther , smiling .
&quot; How nice !
but I wish she &apos;d let us have them now .
<unk> is not agreeable , &quot; observed Amy , taking a last look at the diamonds .
&quot; It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things .
The first one who is <unk> will have the <unk> has said it ; and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go , for Madame <unk> your good behavior and charming manners . &quot;
&quot; Do you think so ?
Oh , I &apos;ll be a <unk> , if I can only have that lovely ring !
It &apos;s ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant &apos;s .
I do like Aunt March , after all ; &quot; and Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face , and a firm resolve to earn it .
From that day she was a model of obedience , and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training .
Esther fitted up the closet with a little table , placed a <unk> before it , and over it a picture taken from one of the <unk> rooms .
She thought it was of no great value , but , being appropriate , she borrowed it , well knowing that Madame would never know it , nor care if she did .
It was , however , a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world , and Amy &apos;s <unk> eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the divine mother , while tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart .
On the table she laid her little <unk> and <unk> , kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her , and came every day to &quot; sit alone , thinking good thoughts , and <unk> the dear God to preserve her sister . &quot;
Esther had given her a rosary of black beads , with a silver cross , but Amy hung it up and did not use it , feeling <unk> as to its <unk> for <unk> prayers .
The little girl was very sincere in all this , for , being left alone outside the safe <unk> , she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely , that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender Friend , whose fatherly love most closely <unk> his little children .
She missed her mother &apos;s help to understand and rule herself , but having been taught where to look , she did her best to find the way , and walk in it confidingly .
But Amy was a young pilgrim , and just now her burden seemed very heavy .
She tried to forget herself , to keep cheerful , and be satisfied with doing right , though no one saw or praised her for it .
In her first effort at being very , very good , she decided to make her will , as Aunt March had done ; so that if she _ did _ fall ill and die , her possessions might be <unk> and generously <unk> .
It cost her a <unk> even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old lady &apos;s <unk> .
During one of her <unk> she wrote out the important document as well as she could , with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms , and , when the good-natured Frenchwoman had <unk> her name , Amy felt relieved , and laid it by to show Laurie , whom she wanted as a second <unk> .
As it was a rainy day , she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large <unk> , and took Polly with her for company .
In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes , with which Esther allowed her to play , and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the faded <unk> , and parade up and down before the long mirror , making stately <unk> , and sweeping her train about , with a rustle which delighted her ears .
So busy was she on this day that she did not hear Laurie &apos;s ring , nor see his face peeping in at her , as she gravely promenaded to and fro , flirting her fan and tossing her head , on which she wore a great pink <unk> , <unk> <unk> with her blue <unk> dress and yellow <unk> <unk> .
She was obliged to walk carefully , for she had on high-heeled shoes , and , as Laurie told Jo afterward , it was a comical sight to see her <unk> along in her gay suit , with Polly <unk> and <unk> just behind her , imitating her as well as he could , and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim , &quot; <unk> &apos;t we fine ?
Get along , you fright !
Hold your tongue !
Kiss me , dear !
Ha !
ha ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : <unk> promenaded to and fro &#93; Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment , lest it should <unk> her <unk> , Laurie <unk> , and was graciously received .
&quot; Sit down and rest while I put these things away ; then I want to consult you about a very serious matter , &quot; said Amy , when she had shown her splendor , and driven Polly into a corner .
&quot; That bird is the trial of my life , &quot; she continued , <unk> the pink mountain from her head , while Laurie seated himself <unk> of a chair .
&quot; Yesterday , when aunt was asleep , and I was trying to be as still as a <unk> , Polly began to <unk> and flap about in his cage ; so I went to let him out , and found a big spider there .
I poked it out , and it ran under the <unk> ; Polly marched straight after it , stooped down and peeped under the <unk> , saying , in his funny way , with a <unk> of his eye , &apos; Come out and take a walk , my dear . &apos;
I _ couldn &apos;t _ help laughing , which made Poll <unk> , and aunt woke up and scolded us both . &quot;
&quot; Did the spider accept the old fellow &apos;s invitation ? &quot;
asked Laurie , <unk> .
&quot; Yes ; out it came , and away ran Polly , frightened to death , and scrambled up on aunt &apos;s chair , calling out , &apos; <unk> her !
catch her !
catch her ! &apos;
as I <unk> the spider .
&quot; That &apos;s a lie !
Oh <unk> ! &quot;
cried the parrot , pecking at Laurie &apos;s toes .
&quot; I &apos;d <unk> your neck if you were mine , you old torment , &quot; cried Laurie , shaking his fist at the bird , who put his head on one side , and gravely croaked , &quot; <unk> !
bless your buttons , dear ! &quot;
&quot; Now I &apos;m ready , &quot; said Amy , shutting the wardrobe , and taking a paper out of her pocket .
&quot; I want you to read that , please , and tell me if it is legal and right .
I felt that I ought to do it , for life is <unk> and I don &apos;t want any <unk> over my tomb . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Amy &apos;s Will &#93; Laurie bit his lips , and turning a little from the pensive <unk> , read the following document , with praiseworthy gravity , <unk> the spelling : -- &quot; MY <unk> WILL AND <unk> .
&quot; I , Amy <unk> March , being in my <unk> mind , do give and <unk> all my <unk> <unk> .
to <unk> : <unk> &quot; To my father , my best pictures , sketches , maps , and works of art , including <unk> .
Also my $ <unk> , to do what he likes with .
&quot; To my mother , all my clothes , except the blue apron with pockets , <unk> my <unk> , and my <unk> , with much love .
&quot; To my dear sister Margaret , I give my <unk> ring ( if I get it ) , also my green box with the <unk> on it , also my piece of real lace for her neck , and my sketch of her as a <unk> of her &apos; little girl . &apos;
&quot; To Jo I leave my <unk> , the one mended with <unk> <unk> , also my <unk> <unk> lost the <unk> my most precious plaster <unk> , because I am sorry I burnt up her story .
&quot; To Beth ( if she lives after me ) I give my dolls and the little bureau , my fan , my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being thin when she gets well .
And I <unk> also leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna .
&quot; To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I <unk> my paper <unk> portfolio , my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn &apos;t any neck .
Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes , <unk> <unk> is the best .
&quot; To our venerable <unk> Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family , <unk> Beth .
&quot; I wish my favorite <unk> Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron and my <unk> ring with a kiss .
&quot; To Hannah I give the <unk> she wanted and all the <unk> work I leave hoping she &apos; will remember me , when it you see . &apos;
&quot; And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead .
I forgive every one , and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound .
<unk> .
&quot; To this will and <unk> I set my hand and seal on this <unk> day of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
&quot; AMY <unk> MARCH .
{ <unk> <unk> , &quot; _ <unk> _ : { { <unk> LAURENCE . &quot;
The last name was written in pencil , and Amy explained that he was to <unk> it in ink , and seal it up for her properly .
&quot; What put it into your head ?
Did any one tell you about Beth &apos;s giving away her things ? &quot;
asked Laurie soberly , as Amy laid a bit of red <unk> , with <unk> , a <unk> , and a <unk> before him .
She explained ; and then asked anxiously , &quot; What about Beth ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sorry I spoke ; but as I did , I &apos;ll tell you .
She felt so ill one day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg , her cats to you , and the poor old doll to Jo , who would love it for her sake .
She was sorry she had so little to give , and left locks of hair to the rest of us , and her best love to grandpa .
_ She _ never thought of a will . &quot;
Laurie was <unk> and <unk> as he spoke , and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper .
Amy &apos;s face was full of trouble ; but she only said , &quot; Don &apos;t people put sort of <unk> to their wills , sometimes ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; &apos; <unk> , &apos; they call them . &quot;
&quot; Put one in mine <unk> I wish _ all _ my curls cut off , and given round to my friends .
I forgot it ; but I want it done , though it will spoil my looks . &quot;
Laurie added it , smiling at Amy &apos;s last and greatest sacrifice .
Then he amused her for an hour , and was much interested in all her trials .
But when he came to go , Amy held him back to whisper , with trembling lips , &quot; Is there really any danger about Beth ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid there is ; but we must hope for the best , so don &apos;t cry , dear ; &quot; and Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting .
When he had gone , she went to her little chapel , and , sitting in the twilight , prayed for Beth , with <unk> tears and an aching heart , feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : Mrs. March would not leave Beth &apos;s side &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
I don &apos;t think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters ; such hours are beautiful to live , but very hard to describe , so I will leave it to the <unk> of my readers , merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness , and that Meg &apos;s tender hope was realized ; for when Beth woke from that long , <unk> sleep , the first <unk> on which her eyes fell _ were _ the little rose and mother &apos;s face .
Too weak to wonder at anything , she only smiled , and nestled close into the loving arms about her , feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last .
Then she slept again , and the girls waited upon their mother , for she would not <unk> the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep .
Hannah had &quot; <unk> up &quot; an astonishing breakfast for the traveller , finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way ; and Meg and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young <unk> , while they listened to her whispered account of father &apos;s state , Mr. Brooke &apos;s promise to stay and nurse him , the <unk> which the storm <unk> on the homeward journey , and the <unk> comfort Laurie &apos;s hopeful face had given her when she arrived , worn out with <unk> , anxiety , and cold .
What a strange , yet pleasant day that was !
so brilliant and gay without , for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow ; so quiet and <unk> within , for every one slept , spent with watching , and a <unk> <unk> reigned through the house , while nodding Hannah mounted guard at the door .
With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off , Meg and Jo closed their <unk> eyes , and lay at rest , like <unk> boats , safe at <unk> in a quiet <unk> .
Mrs. March would not leave Beth &apos;s side , but rested in the big chair , waking often to look at , touch , and brood over her child , like a <unk> over some recovered treasure .
Laurie , meanwhile , posted off to comfort Amy , and told his story so well that Aunt March actually &quot; sniffed &quot; herself , and never once said , &quot; I told you so . &quot;
Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit .
She dried her tears quickly , restrained her impatience to see her mother , and never even thought of the turquoise ring , when the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie &apos;s opinion , that she behaved &quot; like a capital little woman . &quot;
Even Polly seemed impressed , for he called her &quot; good girl , &quot; blessed her buttons , and begged her to &quot; come and take a walk , dear , &quot; in his most <unk> tone .
She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather ; but , <unk> that Laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of <unk> efforts to conceal the fact , she persuaded him to rest on the sofa , while she wrote a note to her mother .
She was a long time about it ; and , when she returned , he was stretched out , with both arms under his head , sound asleep , while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains , and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of <unk> .
After a while , they began to think he was not going to wake till night , and I &apos;m not sure that he would , had he not been effectually roused by Amy &apos;s cry of joy at sight of her mother .
There probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day , but it is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all , when she sat in her mother &apos;s lap and told her trials , receiving consolation and <unk> in the shape of approving smiles and fond <unk> .
They were alone together in the chapel , to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her .
&quot; On the contrary , I like it very much , dear , &quot; looking from the dusty rosary to the well-worn little book , and the lovely picture with its garland of <unk> .
&quot; It is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet , when things <unk> or <unk> us .
There are a good many hard times in this life of ours , but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way .
I think my little girl is learning this ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , mother ; and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books , and the copy of that picture which I &apos;ve tried to make .
The woman &apos;s face is not good , --it &apos;s too beautiful for me to draw , --but the baby is done better , and I love it very much .
I like to think He was a little child once , for then I don &apos;t seem so far away , and that helps me . &quot;
As Amy pointed to the smiling <unk> on his mother &apos;s knee , Mrs. March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile .
She said nothing , but Amy understood the look , and , after a minute &apos;s pause , she added gravely , -- &quot; I wanted to speak to you about this , but I forgot it .
Aunt gave me the ring to-day ; she called me to her and kissed me , and put it on my finger , and said I was a credit to her , and she &apos;d like to keep me always .
She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on , as it &apos;s too big .
I &apos;d like to wear them , mother ; can I ? &quot;
&quot; They are very pretty , but I think you &apos;re rather too young for such ornaments , Amy , &quot; said Mrs. March , looking at the plump little hand , with the band of sky-blue <unk> on the <unk> , and the quaint guard , <unk> of two tiny , golden hands clasped together .
&quot; I &apos;ll try not to be vain , &quot; said Amy .
&quot; I don &apos;t think I like it only because it &apos;s so pretty ; but I want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet , to remind me of something . &quot;
&quot; Do you mean Aunt March ? &quot;
asked her mother , laughing .
&quot; No , to remind me not to be selfish . &quot;
Amy looked so earnest and sincere about it , that her mother stopped laughing , and listened respectfully to the little plan .
&quot; I &apos;ve thought a great deal lately about my &apos; bundle of <unk> , &apos; and being selfish is the <unk> one in it ; so I &apos;m going to try hard to cure it , if I can .
Beth isn &apos;t selfish , and that &apos;s the reason every one loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her .
People wouldn &apos;t feel half so bad about me if I was sick , and I don &apos;t deserve to have them ; but I &apos;d like to be loved and missed by a great many friends , so I &apos;m going to try and be like Beth all I can .
I &apos;m apt to forget my resolutions ; but if I had something always about me to remind me , I guess I should do better .
May I try this way ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet .
<unk> your ring , dear , and do your best ; I think you will prosper , for the sincere wish to be good is half the <unk> .
Now I must go back to Beth .
Keep up your heart , little daughter , and we will soon have you home again . &quot;
That evening , while Meg was writing to her father , to report the traveller &apos;s safe <unk> , Jo slipped up stairs into Beth &apos;s room , and , finding her mother in her usual place , stood a minute <unk> her fingers in her hair , with a worried gesture and an undecided look .
&quot; What is it , deary ? &quot;
asked Mrs. March , holding out her hand , with a face which invited confidence .
&quot; I want to tell you something , mother . &quot;
&quot; About Meg ? &quot;
&quot; How quickly you guessed !
Yes , it &apos;s about her , and though it &apos;s a little thing , it fidgets me . &quot;
&quot; Beth is asleep ; speak low , and tell me all about it .
That Moffat hasn &apos;t been here , I hope ? &quot;
asked Mrs. March rather sharply .
&quot; No , I should have shut the door in his face if he had , &quot; said Jo , settling herself on the floor at her mother &apos;s feet .
&quot; <unk> summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences &apos; , and only one was returned .
We forgot all about it , till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke had it .
He kept it in his waistcoat pocket , and once it fell out , and Teddy <unk> him about it , and Mr. Brooke <unk> that he liked Meg , but didn &apos;t dare say so , she was so young and he so poor .
Now , isn &apos;t it a _ dread _ <unk> state of things ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think Meg cares for him ? &quot;
asked Mrs. March , with an anxious look .
&quot; Mercy me !
I don &apos;t know anything about love and such nonsense ! &quot;
cried Jo , with a funny mixture of interest and <unk> .
&quot; In novels , the girls show it by <unk> and blushing , fainting away , growing thin , and acting like <unk> .
Now Meg does not do anything of the sort : she <unk> and <unk> and sleeps , like a sensible creature : she looks straight in my face when I talk about that man , and only <unk> a little bit when Teddy jokes about lovers .
I <unk> him to do it , but he doesn &apos;t mind me as he ought . &quot;
&quot; Then you fancy that Meg is _ not _ interested in John ? &quot;
&quot; Who ? &quot;
cried Jo , staring .
&quot; Mr. Brooke .
I call him &apos; John &apos; now ; we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital , and he likes it . &quot;
&quot; Oh , dear !
I know you &apos;ll take his part : he &apos;s been good to father , and you won &apos;t send him away , but let Meg marry him , if she wants to .
<unk> thing !
to go petting papa and helping you , just to <unk> you into liking him ; &quot; and Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful <unk> .
&quot; My dear , don &apos;t get angry about it , and I will tell you how it happened .
John went with me at Mr. Laurence &apos;s request , and was so devoted to poor father that we couldn &apos;t help getting fond of him .
He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg , for he told us he loved her , but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him .
He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her , and the right to make her love him if he could .
He is a truly excellent young man , and we could not refuse to listen to him ; but I will not consent to Meg &apos;s engaging herself so young . &quot;
&quot; Of course not ; it would be <unk> !
I knew there was mischief <unk> ; I felt it ; and now it &apos;s worse than I imagined .
I just wish I could marry Meg myself , and keep her safe in the family . &quot;
This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile ; but she said gravely , &quot; Jo , I <unk> in you , and don &apos;t wish you to say anything to Meg yet .
When John comes back , and I see them together , I can <unk> better of her feelings toward him . &quot;
&quot; She &apos;ll see his in those handsome eyes that she talks about , and then it will be all up with her .
She &apos;s got such a soft heart , it will melt like butter in the sun if any one looks <unk> at her .
She read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters , and <unk> me when I spoke of it , and likes brown eyes , and doesn &apos;t think John an ugly name , and she &apos;ll go and fall in love , and there &apos;s an end of peace and fun , and cosy times together .
I see it all !
they &apos;ll go lovering around the house , and we shall have to <unk> ; Meg will be absorbed , and no good to me any more ; Brooke will <unk> up a fortune somehow , carry her off , and make a hole in the family ; and I shall break my heart , and everything will be <unk> uncomfortable .
Oh , dear me !
why weren &apos;t we all boys , then there wouldn &apos;t be any bother . &quot;
Jo leaned her chin on her knees , in a <unk> attitude , and shook her fist at the reprehensible John .
Mrs. March sighed , and Jo looked up with an air of relief .
&quot; You don &apos;t like it , mother ?
I &apos;m glad of it .
Let &apos;s send him about his business , and not tell Meg a word of it , but all be happy together as we always have been . &quot;
&quot; I did wrong to sigh , Jo .
It is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own , in time ; but I do want to keep my girls as long as I can ; and I am sorry that this happened so soon , for Meg is only seventeen , and it will be some years before John can make a home for her .
Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way , nor be married , before twenty .
If she and John love one another , they can wait , and test the love by doing so .
She is <unk> , and I have no fear of her <unk> him <unk> .
My pretty , tender-hearted girl !
I hope things will go happily with her . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;t you rather have her marry a rich man ? &quot;
asked Jo , as her mother &apos;s voice faltered a little over the last words .
&quot; Money is a good and useful thing , Jo ; and I hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly , nor be tempted by too much .
I should like to know that John was firmly <unk> in some good business , which gave him an <unk> large enough to keep free from debt and make Meg comfortable .
I &apos;m not ambitious for a splendid fortune , a fashionable position , or a great name for my girls .
If rank and money come with love and virtue , also , I should accept them gratefully , and enjoy your good fortune ; but I know , by experience , how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house , where the daily bread is earned , and some <unk> give sweetness to the few pleasures .
I am content to see Meg begin humbly , for , if I am not mistaken , she will be rich in the possession of a good man &apos;s heart , and that is better than a fortune . &quot;
&quot; I understand , mother , and quite agree ; but I &apos;m disappointed about Meg , for I &apos;d planned to have her marry Teddy by and by , and sit in the lap of luxury all her days .
Wouldn &apos;t it be nice ? &quot;
asked Jo , looking up , with a <unk> face .
&quot; He is younger than she , you know , &quot; began Mrs. March ; but Jo broke in , -- &quot; Only a little ; he &apos;s old for his age , and tall ; and can be quite grown-up in his manners if he likes .
Then he &apos;s rich and generous and good , and loves us all ; and _ I _ say it &apos;s a pity my plan is spoilt . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid Laurie is hardly grown up enough for Meg , and altogether too much of a weathercock , just now , for any one to depend on .
Don &apos;t make plans , Jo ; but let time and their own hearts mate your friends .
We can &apos;t <unk> safely in such matters , and had better not get &apos; romantic rubbish , &apos; as you call it , into our heads , lest it spoil our friendship . &quot;
&quot; Well , I won &apos;t ; but I hate to see things going all <unk> and getting <unk> up , when a pull here and a <unk> there would <unk> it out .
I wish wearing <unk> on our heads would keep us from growing up .
But <unk> will be roses , and kittens , cats , <unk> &apos;s the pity ! &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s that about <unk> and cats ? &quot;
asked Meg , as she crept into the room , with the finished letter in her hand .
&quot; Only one of my stupid speeches .
I &apos;m going to bed ; come , <unk> , &quot; said Jo , unfolding herself , like an <unk> <unk> .
&quot; Quite right , and beautifully written .
Please add that I send my love to John , &quot; said Mrs. March , as she glanced over the letter , and gave it back .
&quot; Do you call him &apos; John &apos; ? &quot;
asked Meg , smiling , with her innocent eyes looking down into her mother &apos;s .
&quot; Yes ; he has been like a son to us , and we are very fond of him , &quot; replied Mrs. March , returning the look with a keen one .
&quot; I &apos;m glad of that , he is so lonely .
Good-night , mother , dear .
It is so <unk> comfortable to have you here , &quot; was Meg &apos;s quiet answer .
The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one ; and , as she went away , Mrs. March said , with a mixture of satisfaction and regret , &quot; She does not love John yet , but will soon learn to . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : Letters &#93; <unk> .
LAURIE MAKES <unk> , AND JO MAKES <unk> .
Jo &apos;s face was a study next day , for the secret rather weighed upon her , and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important .
Meg observed it , but did not trouble herself to make inquiries , for she had learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of <unk> , so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask .
She was rather surprised , therefore , when the silence remained unbroken , and Jo assumed a patronizing air , which decidedly aggravated Meg , who in her turn assumed an air of dignified <unk> , and devoted herself to her mother .
This left Jo to her own devices ; for Mrs. March had taken her place as nurse , and bade her rest , exercise , and amuse herself after her long confinement .
Amy being gone , Laurie was her only refuge ; and , much as she enjoyed his society , she rather dreaded him just then , for he was an incorrigible tease , and she feared he would <unk> her secret from her .
She was quite right , for the <unk> lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out , and led Jo a trying life of it .
He <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , threatened , and scolded ; affected indifference , that he might surprise the truth from her ; declared he knew , then that he didn &apos;t care ; and , at last , by <unk> of <unk> , he satisfied himself that it <unk> Meg and Mr. Brooke .
Feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutor &apos;s confidence , he set his wits to work to <unk> some proper <unk> for the slight .
Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter , and was absorbed in preparations for her father &apos;s return ; but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her , and , for a day or two , she was quite unlike herself .
She started when spoken to , blushed when looked at , was very quiet , and sat over her sewing , with a timid , troubled look on her face .
To her mother &apos;s inquiries she answered that she was quite well , and Jo &apos;s she <unk> by begging to be let alone .
&quot; She feels it in the <unk> , I <unk> she &apos;s going very fast .
She &apos;s got most of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and cross , doesn &apos;t eat , lies awake , and <unk> in corners .
I caught her singing that song he gave her , and once she said &apos; John , &apos; as you do , and then turned as red as a <unk> .
Whatever shall we do ? &quot;
said Jo , looking ready for any <unk> , however violent .
&quot; Nothing but wait .
Let her alone , be kind and patient , and father &apos;s coming will settle everything , &quot; replied her mother .
&quot; Here &apos;s a note to you , Meg , all sealed up .
How odd !
Teddy never <unk> mine , &quot; said Jo , next day , as she distributed the <unk> of the little post-office .
Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs , when a sound from Meg made them look up to see her staring at her note , with a frightened face .
&quot; My child , what is it ? &quot;
cried her mother , running to her , while Jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief .
&quot; It &apos;s all a <unk> didn &apos;t send it .
O Jo , how could you do it ? &quot;
and Meg hid her face in her hands , crying as if her heart was quite broken .
&quot; Me !
I &apos;ve done nothing !
What &apos;s she talking about ? &quot;
cried Jo , bewildered .
Meg &apos;s mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket , and threw it at Jo , saying <unk> , -- &quot; You wrote it , and that bad boy helped you .
How could you be so rude , so mean , and cruel to us both ? &quot;
Jo hardly heard her , for she and her mother were reading the note , which was written in a peculiar hand .
&#91; Illustration : Jo and her mother were reading the note &#93; &quot; MY DEAREST <unk> , -- &quot; I can no longer restrain my passion , and must know my fate before I return .
I dare not tell your parents yet , but I think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another .
Mr. Laurence will help me to some good place , and then , my sweet girl , you will make me happy .
I <unk> you to say nothing to your family yet , but to send one word of hope through Laurie to &quot; Your devoted JOHN . &quot;
&quot; Oh , the little villain !
that &apos;s the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to mother .
I &apos;ll give him a hearty scolding , and bring him over to beg pardon , &quot; cried Jo , burning to <unk> immediate justice .
But her mother held her back , saying , with a look she seldom wore , -- &quot; Stop , Jo , you must clear yourself first .
You have played so many pranks , that I am afraid you have had a hand in this . &quot;
&quot; On my word , mother , I haven &apos;t !
I never saw that note before , and don &apos;t know anything about it , as true as I live ! &quot;
said Jo , so earnestly that they believed her .
&quot; If I _ had _ taken a part in it I &apos;d have done it better than this , and have written a sensible note .
I should think you &apos;d have known Mr. Brooke wouldn &apos;t write such stuff as that , &quot; she added , scornfully tossing down the paper .
&quot; It &apos;s like his writing , &quot; faltered Meg , <unk> it with the note in her hand .
&quot; O Meg , you didn &apos;t answer it ? &quot;
cried Mrs. March quickly .
&quot; Yes , I did ! &quot;
and Meg hid her face again , overcome with shame .
&quot; Here &apos;s a scrape !
_ Do _ let me bring that wicked boy over to explain , and be lectured .
I can &apos;t rest till I get hold of him ; &quot; and Jo made for the door again .
&quot; Hush !
let me manage this , for it is worse than I thought .
Margaret , tell me the whole story , &quot; commanded Mrs. March , sitting down by Meg , yet keeping hold of Jo , lest she should fly off .
&quot; I received the first letter from Laurie , who didn &apos;t look as if he knew anything about it , &quot; began Meg , without looking up .
&quot; I was worried at first , and meant to tell you ; then I remembered how you liked Mr. Brooke , so I thought you wouldn &apos;t mind if I kept my little secret for a few days .
I &apos;m so silly that I liked to think no one knew ; and , while I was <unk> what to say , I felt like the girls in books , who have such things to do .
Forgive me , mother , I &apos;m paid for my <unk> now ; I never can look him in the face again . &quot;
&quot; What did you say to him ? &quot;
asked Mrs. March .
&quot; I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet ; that I didn &apos;t wish to have secrets from you , and he must speak to father .
I was very grateful for his kindness , and would be his friend , but nothing more , for a long while . &quot;
Mrs. March smiled , as if well pleased , and Jo clapped her hands , exclaiming , with a laugh , -- &quot; You are almost equal to <unk> <unk> , who was a pattern of <unk> !
Tell on , Meg .
What did he say to that ? &quot;
&quot; He writes in a different way entirely , telling me that he never sent any <unk> at all , and is very sorry that my <unk> sister , Jo , should take such liberties with our names .
It &apos;s very kind and respectful , but think how dreadful for me ! &quot;
Meg leaned against her mother , looking the <unk> of despair , and Jo tramped about the room , calling Laurie names .
All of a sudden she stopped , caught up the two notes , and , after looking at them closely , said decidedly , &quot; I don &apos;t believe Brooke ever saw either of these letters .
Teddy wrote both , and keeps yours to crow over me with , because I wouldn &apos;t tell him my secret . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t have any secrets , Jo ; tell it to mother , and keep out of trouble , as I should have done , &quot; said Meg <unk> .
&quot; Bless you , child !
Mother told me . &quot;
&quot; That will do , Jo .
I &apos;ll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie .
I shall <unk> the matter to the bottom , and put a stop to such pranks at once . &quot;
Away ran Jo , and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke &apos;s real feelings .
&quot; Now , dear , what are your own ?
Do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you , or will you keep yourself quite free for the present ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been so <unk> and worried , I don &apos;t want to have anything to do with lovers for a long while , <unk> never , &quot; answered Meg petulantly .
&quot; If John _ doesn &apos;t _ know anything about this nonsense , don &apos;t tell him , and make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues .
I won &apos;t be <unk> and <unk> and made a fool of , --it &apos;s a shame ! &quot;
Seeing that Meg &apos;s usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke , Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire silence , and great discretion for the future .
The instant Laurie &apos;s step was heard in the hall , Meg fled into the study , and Mrs. March received the culprit alone .
Jo had not told him why he was wanted , fearing he wouldn &apos;t come ; but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March &apos;s face , and stood <unk> his hat , with a guilty air which <unk> him at once .
Jo was <unk> , but chose to march up and down the hall like a <unk> , having some fear that the prisoner might <unk> .
The sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour ; but what happened during that <unk> the girls never knew .
When they were called in , Laurie was standing by their mother , with such a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot , but did not think it wise to betray the fact .
Meg received his humble apology , and was much comforted by the <unk> that Brooke knew nothing of the joke .
&quot; I &apos;ll never tell him to my dying day , <unk> horses sha &apos;n&apos;t drag it out of me ; so you &apos;ll forgive me , Meg , and I &apos;ll do anything to show how <unk> sorry I am , &quot; he added , looking very much ashamed of himself .
&quot; I &apos;ll try ; but it was a very <unk> thing to do .
I didn &apos;t think you could be so sly and <unk> , Laurie , &quot; replied Meg , trying to hide her <unk> confusion under a gravely reproachful air .
&quot; It was altogether abominable , and I don &apos;t deserve to be spoken to for a month ; but you will , though , won &apos;t you ? &quot;
and Laurie folded his hands together with such an imploring gesture , as he spoke in his <unk> persuasive tone , that it was impossible to frown upon him , in spite of his <unk> behavior .
Meg <unk> him , and Mrs. March &apos;s grave face relaxed , in spite of her efforts to keep sober , when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of <unk> , and <unk> himself like a <unk> before the injured <unk> .
Jo stood <unk> , meanwhile , trying to <unk> her heart against him , and succeeding only in <unk> up her face into an expression of entire <unk> .
Laurie looked at her once or twice , but , as she showed no sign of <unk> , he felt injured , and turned his back on her till the others were done with him , when he made her a low bow , and walked off without a word .
As soon as he had gone , she wished she had been more <unk> ; and when Meg and her mother went upstairs , she felt lonely , and longed for Teddy .
After <unk> for some time , she yielded to the impulse , and , armed with a book to return , went over to the big house .
&quot; Is Mr. Laurence in ? &quot;
asked Jo , of a <unk> , who was coming down stairs .
&quot; Yes , miss ; but I don &apos;t believe he &apos;s <unk> just yet . &quot;
&quot; Why not ?
is he ill ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , no , miss , but he &apos;s had a scene with Mr. Laurie , who is in one of his <unk> about something , which <unk> the old gentleman , so I <unk> &apos;t go <unk> him . &quot;
&quot; Where is Laurie ? &quot;
&quot; Shut up in his room , and he won &apos;t answer , though I &apos;ve been <unk> .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s to become of the dinner , for it &apos;s ready , and there &apos;s no one to eat it . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll go and see what the matter is .
I &apos;m not afraid of either of them . &quot;
Up went Jo , and knocked <unk> on the door of Laurie &apos;s little study .
&quot; Stop that , or I &apos;ll open the door and make you ! &quot;
called out the young gentleman , in a threatening tone .
Jo immediately knocked again ; the door flew open , and in she bounced , before Laurie could recover from his surprise .
Seeing that he really _ was _ out of temper , Jo , who knew how to manage him , assumed a <unk> expression , and going artistically down upon her knees , said meekly , &quot; Please forgive me for being so cross .
I came to make it up , and can &apos;t go away till I have . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s all right .
Get up , and don &apos;t be a goose , Jo , &quot; was the <unk> reply to her <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : Get up and don &apos;t be a goose &#93; &quot; Thank you ; I will .
Could I ask what &apos;s the matter ?
You don &apos;t look exactly easy in your mind . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been shaken , and I won &apos;t bear it ! &quot;
<unk> Laurie indignantly .
&quot; Who did it ? &quot;
demanded Jo .
&quot; <unk> ; if it had been any one else I &apos;d <unk> &quot; and the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm .
&quot; That &apos;s nothing ; I often shake you , and you don &apos;t mind , &quot; said Jo soothingly .
&quot; <unk> !
you &apos;re a girl , and it &apos;s fun ; but I &apos;ll allow no man to shake _ me _ . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think any one would care to try it , if you looked as much like a <unk> as you do now .
Why were you treated so ? &quot;
&quot; Just because I wouldn &apos;t say what your mother wanted me for .
I &apos;d promised not to tell , and of course I wasn &apos;t going to break my word . &quot;
&quot; Couldn &apos;t you satisfy your grandpa in any other way ? &quot;
&quot; No ; he _ would _ have the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth .
I &apos;d have told my part of the scrape , if I could without bringing Meg in .
As I couldn &apos;t , I held my tongue , and bore the scolding till the old gentleman <unk> me .
Then I got angry , and bolted , for fear I should forget myself . &quot;
&quot; It wasn &apos;t nice , but he &apos;s sorry , I know ; so go down and make up .
I &apos;ll help you . &quot;
&quot; <unk> if I do !
I &apos;m not going to be lectured and <unk> by every one , just for a bit of a frolic .
I _ was _ sorry about Meg , and begged pardon like a man ; but I won &apos;t do it again , when I wasn &apos;t in the wrong . &quot;
&quot; He didn &apos;t know that . &quot;
&quot; He ought to trust me , and not act as if I was a baby .
It &apos;s no use , Jo ; he &apos;s got to learn that I &apos;m able to take care of myself , and don &apos;t need any one &apos;s <unk> to hold on by . &quot;
&quot; What <unk> you are ! &quot;
sighed Jo .
&quot; How do you mean to settle this affair ? &quot;
&quot; Well , he ought to beg pardon , and believe me when I say I can &apos;t tell him what the fuss &apos;s about . &quot;
&quot; Bless you !
he won &apos;t do that . &quot;
&quot; I won &apos;t go down till he does . &quot;
&quot; Now , Teddy , be sensible ; let it pass , and I &apos;ll explain what I can .
You can &apos;t stay here , so what &apos;s the use of being melodramatic ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t intend to stay here long , any way .
I &apos;ll slip off and take a journey somewhere , and when grandpa <unk> me he &apos;ll come round fast enough . &quot;
&quot; I dare say ; but you ought not to go and worry him . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t preach .
I &apos;ll go to Washington and see Brooke ; it &apos;s gay there , and I &apos;ll enjoy myself after the troubles . &quot;
&quot; What fun you &apos;d have !
I wish I could run off too , &quot; said Jo , forgetting her part of <unk> in lively visions of <unk> life at the capital .
&quot; Come on , then !
Why not ?
You go and surprise your father , and I &apos;ll stir up old Brooke .
It would be a glorious joke ; let &apos;s do it , Jo .
We &apos;ll leave a letter saying we are all right , and <unk> off at once .
I &apos;ve got money enough ; it will do you good , and be no harm , as you go to your father . &quot;
For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree ; for , wild as the plan was , it just suited her .
She was tired of care and confinement , longed for change , and thoughts of her father <unk> <unk> with the novel charms of <unk> and <unk> , liberty and fun .
Her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window , but they fell on the old house opposite , and she shook her head with sorrowful decision .
&quot; If I was a boy , we &apos;d run away together , and have a capital time ; but as I &apos;m a miserable girl , I must be proper , and stop at home .
Don &apos;t <unk> me , Teddy , it &apos;s a crazy plan . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s the fun of it , &quot; began Laurie , who had got a wilful fit on him , and was possessed to break out of <unk> in some way .
&quot; Hold your tongue ! &quot;
cried Jo , covering her ears .
&quot; &apos; <unk> and <unk> &apos; are my doom , and I may as well make up my mind to it .
I came here to <unk> , not to hear about things that make me <unk> to think of . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : &quot; Hold your tongue ! &quot;
cried Jo , covering her ears &#93; &quot; I know Meg would <unk> such a <unk> , but I thought you had more spirit , &quot; began Laurie <unk> .
&quot; <unk> boy , be quiet !
Sit down and think of your own sins , don &apos;t go making me add to mine .
If I get your grandpa to <unk> for the shaking , will you give up running away ? &quot;
asked Jo seriously .
&quot; Yes , but you won &apos;t do it , &quot; answered Laurie , who wished &quot; to make up , &quot; but felt that his <unk> dignity must be appeased first .
&quot; If I can manage the young one I can the old one , &quot; muttered Jo , as she walked away , leaving Laurie bent over a <unk> <unk> , with his head <unk> up on both hands .
&quot; Come in ! &quot;
and Mr. Laurence &apos;s gruff voice sounded <unk> than ever , as Jo <unk> at his door .
&quot; It &apos;s only me , sir , come to return a book , &quot; she said blandly , as she entered .
&quot; Want any more ? &quot;
asked the old gentleman , looking grim and <unk> , but trying not to show it .
&quot; Yes , please .
I like old Sam so well , I think I &apos;ll try the second volume , &quot; returned Jo , hoping to <unk> him by accepting a second <unk> of <unk> &apos;s &quot; <unk> , &quot; as he had <unk> that lively work .
The <unk> eyebrows <unk> a little , as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the <unk> literature was placed .
Jo skipped up , and , sitting on the top step , affected to be <unk> for her book , but was really wondering how best to <unk> the dangerous object of her visit .
Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was <unk> in her mind ; for , after taking several brisk turns about the room , he <unk> round on her , speaking so abruptly that &quot; <unk> &quot; tumbled face <unk> on the floor .
&quot; What has that boy been about ?
Don &apos;t try to shield him .
I know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home .
I can &apos;t get a word from him ; and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs , and locked himself into his room . &quot;
&quot; He did do wrong , but we forgave him , and all promised not to say a word to any one , &quot; began Jo reluctantly .
&quot; That won &apos;t do ; he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you <unk> girls .
If he &apos;s done anything amiss , he shall confess , beg pardon , and be punished .
Out with it , Jo , I won &apos;t be kept in the dark . &quot;
Mr. Laurence looked so <unk> and spoke so sharply that Jo would have gladly run away , if she could , but she was perched <unk> on the steps , and he stood at the foot , a lion in the path , so she had to stay and brave it out .
&#91; Illustration : He stood at the foot , like a lion in the path &#93; &quot; Indeed , sir , I cannot tell ; mother forbade it .
Laurie has confessed , asked pardon , and been punished quite enough .
We don &apos;t keep silence to shield him , but some one else , and it will make more trouble if you interfere .
Please don &apos;t ; it was partly my fault , but it &apos;s all right now ; so let &apos;s forget it , and talk about the &apos; <unk> , &apos; or something pleasant . &quot;
&quot; Hang the &apos; <unk> ! &apos;
come down and give me your word that this harum-scarum boy of mine hasn &apos;t done anything ungrateful or impertinent .
If he has , after all your kindness to him , I &apos;ll <unk> him with my own hands . &quot;
The <unk> sounded awful , but did not alarm Jo , for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson , whatever he might say to the contrary .
She obediently <unk> , and made as light of the prank as she could without <unk> Meg or forgetting the truth .
&quot; <unk> , if the boy held his tongue because he promised , and not from obstinacy , I &apos;ll forgive him .
He &apos;s a <unk> fellow , and hard to manage , &quot; said Mr. Laurence , <unk> up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a <unk> , and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief .
&quot; So am I ; but a kind word will <unk> me when all the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men couldn &apos;t , &quot; said Jo , trying to say a kind word for her friend , who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another .
&quot; You think I &apos;m not kind to him , hey ? &quot;
was the sharp answer .
&quot; Oh , dear , no , sir ; you are rather too kind sometimes , and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience .
Don &apos;t you think you are ? &quot;
Jo was determined to have it out now , and tried to look quite placid , though she <unk> a little after her bold speech .
To her great relief and surprise , the old gentleman only threw his spectacles on to the table with a rattle , and exclaimed frankly , -- &quot; You &apos;re right , girl , I am !
I love the boy , but he tries my patience past bearing , and I don &apos;t know how it will end , if we go on so . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you , he &apos;ll run away . &quot;
Jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made ; she meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear much <unk> , and hoped he would be more <unk> with the lad .
Mr. Laurence &apos;s ruddy face changed suddenly , and he sat down , with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man , which hung over his table .
It was Laurie &apos;s father , who _ had _ run away in his youth , and married against the <unk> old man &apos;s will .
Jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past , and she wished she had held her tongue .
&quot; He won &apos;t do it unless he is very much worried , and only <unk> it sometimes , when he gets tired of studying .
I often think I should like to , especially since my hair was cut ; so , if you ever miss us , you may <unk> for two boys , and look among the ships bound for <unk> . &quot;
She laughed as she spoke , and Mr. Laurence looked relieved , evidently taking the whole as a joke .
&quot; You <unk> , how dare you talk in that way ?
Where &apos;s your respect for me , and your proper bringing up ?
Bless the boys and girls !
What <unk> they are ; yet we can &apos;t do without them , &quot; he said , <unk> her cheeks <unk> .
&quot; Go and bring that boy down to his dinner , tell him it &apos;s all right , and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather .
I won &apos;t bear it . &quot;
&quot; He won &apos;t come , sir ; he feels badly because you didn &apos;t believe him when he said he couldn &apos;t tell .
I think the shaking hurt his feelings very much . &quot;
Jo tried to look pathetic , but must have failed , for Mr. Laurence began to laugh , and she knew the day was won .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry for that , and ought to thank him for not shaking _ me _ , I suppose .
What the dickens does the fellow expect ? &quot;
and the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own <unk> .
&quot; If I were you , I &apos;d write him an apology , sir .
He says he won &apos;t come down till he has one , and talks about Washington , and goes on in an absurd way .
A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is , and bring him down quite amiable .
Try it ; he likes fun , and this way is better than talking .
I &apos;ll carry it up , and teach him his duty . &quot;
Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look , and put on his spectacles , saying slowly , &quot; You &apos;re a sly <unk> , but I don &apos;t mind being managed by you and Beth .
Here , give me a bit of paper , and let us have done with this nonsense . &quot;
The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult .
Jo dropped a kiss on the top of Mr. Laurence &apos;s <unk> head , and ran up to slip the apology under Laurie &apos;s door , <unk> him , through the <unk> , to be submissive , decorous , and a few other agreeable <unk> .
<unk> the door locked again , she left the note to do its work , and was going quietly away , when the young gentleman <unk> down the banisters , and waited for her at the bottom , saying , with his most virtuous expression of countenance , &quot; What a good fellow you are , Jo !
Did you get blown up ? &quot;
he added , laughing .
&quot; No ; he was pretty mild , on the whole . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
I got it all round ; even you cast me off over there , and I felt just ready to go to the deuce , &quot; he began <unk> .
&quot; Don &apos;t talk in that way ; turn over a new leaf and begin again , Teddy , my son . &quot;
&quot; I keep turning over new leaves , and spoiling them , as I used to spoil my <unk> ; and I make so many <unk> there never will be an end , &quot; he said <unk> .
&quot; Go and eat your dinner ; you &apos;ll feel better after it .
Men always croak when they are hungry , &quot; and Jo whisked out at the front door after that .
&quot; That &apos;s a &apos; <unk> &apos; on my &apos; <unk> , &apos; &quot; answered Laurie , quoting Amy , as he went to partake of <unk> dutifully with his grandfather , who was quite saintly in temper and <unk> respectful in manner all the rest of the day .
Every one thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over ; but the mischief was done , for , though others forgot it , Meg remembered .
She never alluded to a certain person , but she thought of him a good deal , dreamed dreams more than ever ; and once Jo , rummaging her sister &apos;s desk for <unk> , found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words , &quot; Mrs. John Brooke ; &quot; <unk> she groaned tragically , and cast it into the fire , feeling that Laurie &apos;s prank had <unk> the evil day for her .
&#91; Illustration : Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day &#93; <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Like sunshine after storm were the peaceful weeks which followed .
The invalids improved rapidly , and Mr. March began to talk of returning early in the new year .
Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day , amusing herself with the <unk> cats , at first , and , in time , with doll &apos;s sewing , which had fallen sadly <unk> .
Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her a daily airing about the house in her strong arms .
Meg cheerfully <unk> and burnt her white hands cooking delicate messes for &quot; the dear ; &quot; while Amy , a <unk> slave of the ring , <unk> her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could <unk> on her sisters to accept .
As Christmas approached , the usual <unk> began to haunt the house , and Jo frequently convulsed the family by <unk> utterly impossible or <unk> absurd ceremonies , in honor of this unusually merry Christmas .
Laurie was equally <unk> , and would have had <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , if he had had his own way .
After many skirmishes and <unk> , the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched , and went about with forlorn faces , which were rather <unk> by <unk> of laughter when the two got together .
<unk> days of unusually mild weather <unk> <unk> in a splendid Christmas Day .
Hannah &quot; felt in her <unk> &quot; that it was going to be an unusually fine day , and she proved herself a true <unk> , for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success .
To begin with , Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them ; then Beth felt uncommonly well that morning , and , being dressed in her mother &apos;s gift , --a soft crimson <unk> <unk> , <unk> borne in triumph to the window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie .
The <unk> had done their best to be worthy of the name , for , like elves , they had worked by night , and <unk> up a comical surprise .
Out in the garden stood a stately <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand , a great roll of new music in the other , a perfect <unk> of an <unk> round her chilly shoulders , and a Christmas <unk> issuing from her lips , on a pink paper <unk> : -- &quot; THE <unk> TO BETH .
&quot; God bless you , dear Queen <unk> !
May nothing you dismay , But health and peace and happiness Be yours , this Christmas Day .
&quot; Here &apos;s fruit to feed our busy <unk> , And flowers for her nose ; Here &apos;s music for her <unk> , An <unk> for her toes .
&quot; A <unk> of Joanna , see , By Raphael No .
2 , Who labored with great <unk> To make it fair and true .
&quot; <unk> a ribbon red , I beg , For Madam <unk> &apos;s tail ; And ice-cream made by lovely <unk> , -- A <unk> <unk> in a pail .
&quot; <unk> dearest love my <unk> laid <unk> my breast of snow : <unk> it , and the <unk> maid , From Laurie and from Jo . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : The Jungfrau &#93; How Beth laughed when she saw it , how Laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts , and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented them !
&quot; I &apos;m so full of happiness , that , if father was only here , I couldn &apos;t hold one drop more , &quot; said Beth , quite <unk> with <unk> as Jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement , and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the &quot; Jungfrau &quot; had sent her .
&quot; So am I , &quot; added Jo , <unk> the pocket <unk> reposed the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
&quot; I &apos;m sure I am , &quot; echoed Amy , <unk> over the <unk> copy of the <unk> and <unk> , which her mother had given her , in a pretty frame .
&quot; Of course I am ! &quot;
cried Meg , smoothing the silvery folds of her first silk dress ; for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it .
&quot; How can _ I _ be otherwise ? &quot;
said Mrs. March gratefully , as her eyes went from her husband &apos;s letter to Beth &apos;s smiling face , and her hand caressed the <unk> made of gray and golden , chestnut and dark brown hair , which the girls had just fastened on her breast .
Now and then , in this <unk> world , things do happen in the delightful story-book fashion , and what a comfort that is .
Half an hour after every one had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more , the drop came .
Laurie opened the parlor door , and popped his head in very quietly .
He might just as well have turned a <unk> and uttered an Indian <unk> ; for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so <unk> joyful , that every one jumped up , though he only said , in a queer , <unk> voice , &quot; Here &apos;s another Christmas present for the March family . &quot;
Before the words were well out of his mouth , he was whisked away somehow , and in his place appeared a tall man , muffled up to the eyes , leaning on the arm of another tall man , who tried to say something and couldn &apos;t .
Of course there was a general <unk> ; and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits , for the <unk> things were done , and no one said a word .
Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms ; Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away , and had to be <unk> by Laurie in the china-closet ; Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake , as he somewhat <unk> explained ; and Amy , the dignified , tumbled over a stool , and , never stopping to get up , hugged and cried over her father &apos;s boots in the most touching manner .
Mrs. March was the first to recover herself , and held up her hand with a warning , &quot; Hush !
remember Beth ! &quot;
But it was too late ; the study door flew open , the little red <unk> appeared on the threshold , <unk> put strength into the feeble limbs , --and Beth ran straight into her father &apos;s arms .
Never mind what happened just after that ; for the full hearts <unk> , washing away the bitterness of the past , and leaving only the sweetness of the present .
It was not at all romantic , but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again , for Hannah was discovered behind the door , sobbing over the fat turkey , which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen .
As the laugh subsided , Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for his faithful care of her husband , at which Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest , and , <unk> Laurie , he precipitately retired .
Then the two invalids were ordered to repose , which they did , by both sitting in one big chair , and talking hard .
Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them , and how , when the fine weather came , he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it ; how devoted Brooke had been , and how he was altogether a most <unk> and <unk> young man .
Why Mr. March paused a minute just there , and , after a glance at Meg , who was violently poking the fire , looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows , I leave you to imagine ; also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head , and asked , rather abruptly , if he wouldn &apos;t have something to eat .
Jo saw and understood the look ; and she stalked <unk> away to get wine and <unk> , <unk> to herself , as she <unk> the door , &quot; I hate <unk> young men with brown eyes ! &quot;
There never _ was _ such a Christmas dinner as they had that day .
The fat turkey was a sight to behold , when Hannah sent him up , stuffed , <unk> , and <unk> ; so was the <unk> , which quite <unk> in one &apos;s mouth ; likewise the <unk> , in which Amy revelled like a fly in a <unk> .
Everything turned out well , which was a mercy , Hannah said , &quot; For my mind was that <unk> , mum , that it &apos;s a <unk> I didn &apos;t <unk> the pudding , and stuff the turkey with raisins , let alone <unk> &apos; of it in a cloth . &quot;
Mr. Laurence and his grandson <unk> with them , also Mr. Brooke , --at whom Jo glowered darkly , to Laurie &apos;s infinite amusement .
Two <unk> stood side by side at the head of the table , in which sat Beth and her father , <unk> modestly on chicken and a little fruit .
They drank <unk> , told stories , sung songs , &quot; <unk> , &quot; as the old folks say , and had a thoroughly good time .
A <unk> had been planned , but the girls would not leave their father ; so the guests departed early , and , as twilight gathered , the happy family sat together round the fire .
&quot; Just a year ago we were <unk> over the dismal Christmas we expected to have .
Do you remember ? &quot;
asked Jo , breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things .
&quot; Rather a pleasant year on the whole ! &quot;
said Meg , smiling at the fire , and <unk> herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity .
&quot; I think it &apos;s been a pretty hard one , &quot; observed Amy , watching the light shine on her ring , with thoughtful eyes .
&quot; I &apos;m glad it &apos;s over , because we &apos;ve got you back , &quot; whispered Beth , who sat on her father &apos;s knee .
&quot; Rather a rough road for you to travel , my little pilgrims , especially the latter part of it .
But you have got on bravely ; and I think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon , &quot; said Mr. March , looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him .
&quot; How do you know ?
Did mother tell you ? &quot;
asked Jo .
&quot; Not much ; <unk> show which way the wind blows , and I &apos;ve made several discoveries to-day . &quot;
&quot; Oh , tell us what they are ! &quot;
cried Meg , who sat beside him .
&quot; Here is one ; &quot; and taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair , he pointed to the <unk> <unk> , a burn on the back , and two or three little hard <unk> on the palm .
&quot; I remember a time when this hand was white and smooth , and your first care was to keep it so .
It was very pretty then , but to me it is much prettier now , --for in these seeming blemishes I read a little history .
A <unk> has been made of vanity ; this <unk> palm has earned something better than <unk> ; and I &apos;m sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time , so much good-will went into the stitches .
Meg , my dear , I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments .
I &apos;m proud to shake this good , <unk> little hand , and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away . &quot;
If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor , she received it in the hearty <unk> of her father &apos;s hand and the approving smile he gave her .
&quot; What about Jo ?
Please say something nice ; for she has tried so hard , and been so very , very good to me , &quot; said Beth , in her father &apos;s ear .
He laughed , and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite , with an unusually mild expression in her brown face .
&quot; In spite of the curly crop , I don &apos;t see the &apos; son Jo &apos; whom I left a year ago , &quot; said Mr. March .
&quot; I see a young lady who pins her collar straight , <unk> her boots neatly , and neither <unk> , talks slang , nor lies on the rug as she used to do .
Her face is rather thin and pale , just now , with watching and anxiety ; but I like to look at it , for it has grown <unk> , and her voice is lower ; she doesn &apos;t bounce , but <unk> quietly , and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me .
I rather miss my wild girl ; but if I get a strong , helpful , tender-hearted woman in her place , I shall feel quite satisfied .
I don &apos;t know whether the <unk> <unk> our black sheep , but I do know that in all Washington I couldn &apos;t find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars which my good girl sent me . &quot;
Jo &apos;s keen eyes were rather dim for a minute , and her thin face grew rosy in the <unk> , as she received her father &apos;s praise , feeling that she did deserve a <unk> of it .
&quot; Now Beth , &quot; said Amy , longing for her turn , but ready to wait .
&quot; There &apos;s so little of her , I &apos;m afraid to say much , for fear she will slip away altogether , though she is not so shy as she used to be , &quot; began their father cheerfully ; but <unk> how nearly he _ had _ lost her , he held her close , saying tenderly , with her cheek against his own , &quot; I &apos;ve got you safe , my Beth , and I &apos;ll keep you so , please God . &quot;
After a minute &apos;s silence , he looked down at Amy , who sat on the cricket at his feet , and said , with a <unk> of the shining hair , -- &quot; I observed that Amy took <unk> at dinner , ran errands for her mother all the afternoon , gave Meg her place to-night , and has waited on every one with patience and <unk> .
I also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass , and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears ; so I <unk> that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less , and has decided to try and mould her character as carefully as she <unk> her little clay figures .
I am glad of this ; for though I should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her , I shall be infinitely prouder of a <unk> daughter , with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others . &quot;
&quot; What are you thinking of , Beth ? &quot;
asked Jo , when Amy had thanked her father and told about her ring .
&quot; I read in &apos; Pilgrim &apos;s Progress &apos; to-day , how , after many troubles , Christian and <unk> came to a pleasant green <unk> , where lilies bloomed all the year round , and there they rested happily , as we do now , before they went on to their journey &apos;s end , &quot; answered Beth ; adding , as she slipped out of her father &apos;s arms , and went slowly to the instrument , &quot; It &apos;s singing time now , and I want to be in my old place .
I &apos;ll try to sing the song of the <unk> which the <unk> heard .
I made the music for father , because he likes the verses . &quot;
So , sitting at the dear little piano , Beth softly touched the keys , and , in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again , sung to her own <unk> the quaint hymn , which was a <unk> fitting song for her : -- &quot; He that is down need fear no fall , He that is low no pride ; He that is humble ever shall Have God to be his guide .
&quot; I am content with what I have , Little be it or much ; And , Lord !
<unk> still I <unk> , Because Thou <unk> such .
&quot; <unk> to them a burden is , That go on pilgrimage ; Here little , and <unk> bliss , Is best from age to age ! &quot;
<unk> .
AUNT MARCH <unk> THE <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> in her head now and then &#93; Like bees <unk> after their queen , mother and daughters hovered about Mr. March the next day , <unk> everything to look at , wait upon , and listen to the new invalid , who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness .
As he sat <unk> up in a big chair by Beth &apos;s sofa , with the other three close by , and Hannah popping in her head now and then , &quot; to <unk> at the dear man , &quot; nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness .
But something _ was _ needed , and the elder ones felt it , though none confessed the fact .
Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression , as their eyes followed Meg .
Jo had sudden fits of <unk> , and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke &apos;s umbrella , which had been left in the hall ; Meg was absent-minded , shy , and silent , started when the bell rang , and colored when John &apos;s name was mentioned ; Amy said &quot; Every one seemed waiting for something , and couldn &apos;t settle down , which was queer , since father was safe at home , &quot; and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn &apos;t run over as usual .

--Page <unk> . &#93;
Laurie went by in the afternoon , and , seeing Meg at the window , seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit , for he fell down upon one knee in the snow , beat his breast , tore his hair , and clasped his hands imploringly , as if begging some <unk> ; and when Meg told him to behave himself and go away , he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief , and <unk> round the corner as if in utter despair .
&quot; What does the goose mean ? &quot;
said Meg , laughing , and trying to look unconscious .
&quot; He &apos;s showing you how your John will go on by and by .
<unk> , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
answered Jo scornfully .
&quot; Don &apos;t say _ my John _ , it isn &apos;t proper or true ; &quot; but Meg &apos;s voice <unk> over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her .
&quot; Please don &apos;t plague me , Jo ; I &apos;ve told you I don &apos;t care _ much _ about him , and there isn &apos;t to be anything said , but we are all to be friendly , and go on as before . &quot;
&quot; We can &apos;t , for something _ has _ been said , and Laurie &apos;s mischief has spoilt you for me .
I see it , and so does mother ; you are not like your old self a bit , and seem ever so far away from me .
I don &apos;t mean to plague you , and will bear it like a man , but I do wish it was all settled .
I hate to wait ; so if you mean ever to do it , make haste and have it over quickly , &quot; said Jo <unk> .
&quot; _ I _ can &apos;t say or do anything till he speaks , and he won &apos;t , because father said I was too young , &quot; began Meg , bending over her work , with a queer little smile , which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point .
&quot; If he did speak , you wouldn &apos;t know what to say , but would cry or blush , or let him have his own way , instead of giving a good , decided , No . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not so silly and weak as you think .
I know just what I should say , for I &apos;ve planned it all , so I needn &apos;t be taken <unk> ; there &apos;s no knowing what may happen , and I wished to be prepared . &quot;
Jo couldn &apos;t help smiling at the important air which Meg had unconsciously assumed , and which was as becoming as the pretty color <unk> in her cheeks .
&quot; Would you mind telling me what you &apos;d say ? &quot;
asked Jo more respectfully .
&quot; Not at all ; you are sixteen now , quite old enough to be my confidant , and my experience will be useful to you by and by , perhaps , in your own affairs of this sort . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t mean to have any ; it &apos;s fun to watch other people <unk> , but I should feel like a fool doing it myself , &quot; said Jo , looking alarmed at the thought .
&quot; I think not , if you liked any one very much , and he liked you . &quot;
Meg spoke as if to herself , and glanced out at the <unk> , where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight .
&quot; I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man , &quot; said Jo , <unk> <unk> her sister &apos;s little reverie .
&quot; Oh , I should merely say , quite calmly and decidedly , &apos; Thank you , Mr. Brooke , you are very kind , but I agree with father that I am too young to enter into any engagement at present ; so please say no more , but let us be friends as we were . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Hum !
that &apos;s stiff and cool enough .
I don &apos;t believe you &apos;ll ever say it , and I know he won &apos;t be satisfied if you do .
If he goes on like the <unk> lovers in books , you &apos;ll give in , rather than hurt his feelings . &quot;
&quot; No , I won &apos;t .
I shall tell him I &apos;ve made up my mind , and shall walk out of the room with dignity . &quot;
Meg rose as she spoke , and was just going to <unk> the dignified <unk> , when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat , and begin to sew as if her life depended on finishing that particular <unk> in a given time .
Jo <unk> a laugh at the sudden change , and , when some one gave a modest tap , opened the door with a grim aspect , which was anything but hospitable .
&quot; Good afternoon .
I came to get my umbrella , --that is , to see how your father finds himself to-day , &quot; said Mr. Brooke , getting a trifle <unk> as his eye went from one <unk> face to the other .
&quot; It &apos;s very well , he &apos;s in the rack , I &apos;ll get him , and tell it you are here , &quot; and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply , Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity .
But the instant she vanished , Meg began to <unk> towards the door , murmuring , -- &quot; Mother will like to see you .
Pray sit down , I &apos;ll call her . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t go ; are you afraid of me , Margaret ? &quot;
and Mr. Brooke looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude .
She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead , for he had never called her Margaret before , and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it .
<unk> to appear friendly and at her ease , she put out her hand with a confiding gesture , and said gratefully , -- &quot; How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to father ?
I only wish I could thank you for it . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Shall I tell you how ? &#93;
&quot; Shall I tell you how ? &quot;
asked Mr. Brooke , holding the small hand fast in both his own , and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown eyes , that her heart began to flutter , and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen .
&quot; Oh no , please don <unk> &apos;d rather not , &quot; she said , trying to <unk> her hand , and looking frightened in spite of her <unk> .
&quot; I won &apos;t trouble you , I only want to know if you care for me a little , Meg .
I love you so much , dear , &quot; added Mr. Brooke tenderly .
This was the moment for the calm , proper speech , but Meg didn &apos;t make it ; she forgot every word of it , hung her head , and answered , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; so softly , that John had to <unk> down to catch the foolish little reply .
He seemed to think it was worth the trouble , for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied , pressed the plump hand gratefully , and said , in his most persuasive tone , &quot; Will you try and find out ?
I want to know _ so _ much ; for I can &apos;t go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am to have my reward in the end or not . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m too young , &quot; faltered Meg , wondering why she was so <unk> , yet rather enjoying it .
&quot; I &apos;ll wait ; and in the meantime , you could be learning to like me .
Would it be a very hard lesson , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Not if I chose to learn it , <unk> &quot; &quot; Please choose to learn , Meg .
I love to teach , and this is easier than German , &quot; broke in John , getting possession of the other hand , so that she had no way of hiding her face , as he bent to look into it .
His tone was properly <unk> ; but , <unk> a shy look at him , Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender , and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success .
This nettled her ; Annie Moffat &apos;s foolish lessons in <unk> came into her mind , and the love of power , which sleeps in the <unk> of the best of little women , woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her .
She felt excited and strange , and , not knowing what else to do , followed a <unk> impulse , and , <unk> her hands , said petulantly , &quot; I _ don &apos;t _ choose .
Please go away and let me be ! &quot;
Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears , for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before , and it rather bewildered him .
&quot; Do you really mean that ? &quot;
he asked anxiously , following her as she walked away .
&quot; Yes , I do ; I don &apos;t want to be worried about such things .
Father says I needn &apos;t ; it &apos;s too soon and I &apos;d rather not . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;t I hope you &apos;ll change your mind by and by ?
I &apos;ll wait , and say nothing till you have had more time .
Don &apos;t play with me , Meg .
I didn &apos;t think that of you . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t think of me at all .
I &apos;d rather you wouldn &apos;t , &quot; said Meg , taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover &apos;s patience and her own power .
He was grave and pale now , and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired ; but he neither <unk> his forehead nor tramped about the room , as they did ; he just stood looking at her so wistfully , so tenderly , that she found her heart <unk> in spite of her .
What would have happened next I cannot say , if Aunt March had not come <unk> in at this interesting minute .
The old lady couldn &apos;t resist her longing to see her nephew ; for she had met Laurie as she took her airing , and , hearing of Mr. March &apos;s <unk> , drove straight out to see him .
The family were all busy in the back part of the house , and she had made her way quietly in , hoping to surprise them .
She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she had seen a ghost , and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study .
&quot; Bless me , what &apos;s all this ? &quot;
cried the old lady , with a rap of her cane , as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady .
&#91; Illustration : Bless me , what &apos;s all this ? &#93;
&quot; It &apos;s father &apos;s friend .
I &apos;m _ so _ surprised to see you ! &quot;
stammered Meg , feeling that she was in for a lecture now .
&quot; That &apos;s evident , &quot; returned Aunt March , sitting down .
&quot; But what is father &apos;s friend saying to make you look like a <unk> ?
There &apos;s mischief going on , and I <unk> upon knowing what it is , &quot; with another rap .
&quot; We were merely talking .
Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella , &quot; began Meg , wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house .
&quot; Brooke ?
That boy &apos;s tutor ?
Ah !
I understand now .
I know all about it .
Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your father &apos;s letters , and I made her tell me .
You haven &apos;t gone and accepted him , child ? &quot;
cried Aunt March , looking scandalized .
&quot; Hush !
he &apos;ll hear .
<unk> &apos;n&apos;t I call mother ? &quot;
said Meg , much troubled .
&quot; Not yet .
I &apos;ve something to say to you , and I must free my mind at once .
Tell me , do you mean to marry this <unk> ?
If you do , not one penny of my money ever goes to you .
Remember that , and be a sensible girl , &quot; said the old lady impressively .
Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the <unk> people , and enjoyed doing it .
The best of us have a spice of perversity in us , especially when we are young and in love .
If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke , she would probably have declared she couldn &apos;t think of it ; but as she was <unk> ordered _ not _ to like him , she immediately made up her mind that she would .
<unk> as well as perversity made the decision easy , and , being already much excited , Meg <unk> the old lady with unusual spirit .
&quot; I shall marry whom I please , Aunt March , and you can leave your money to any one you like , &quot; she said , nodding her head with a resolute air .
&quot; <unk> <unk> !
Is that the way you take my advice , miss ?
You &apos;ll be sorry for it , by and by , when you &apos;ve tried love in a <unk> , and found it a failure . &quot;
&quot; It can &apos;t be a worse one than some people find in big houses , &quot; retorted Meg .
Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl , for she did not know her in this new mood .
Meg hardly knew herself , she felt so brave and independent , --so glad to defend John , and assert her right to love him , if she liked .
Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong , and , after a little pause , made a fresh start , saying , as <unk> as she could , &quot; Now , Meg , my dear , be reasonable , and take my advice .
I mean it kindly , and don &apos;t want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning .
You ought to marry well , and help your family ; it &apos;s your duty to make a rich match , and it ought to be impressed upon you . &quot;
&quot; Father and mother don &apos;t think so ; they like John , though he _ is _ poor . &quot;
&quot; Your parents , my dear , have no more worldly wisdom than two babies . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad of it , &quot; cried Meg stoutly .
Aunt March took no notice , but went on with her lecture .
&quot; This <unk> is poor , and hasn &apos;t got any rich relations , has he ? &quot;
&quot; No ; but he has many warm friends . &quot;
&quot; You can &apos;t live on friends ; try it , and see how cool they &apos;ll grow .
He hasn &apos;t any business , has he ? &quot;
&quot; Not yet ; Mr. Laurence is going to help him . &quot;
&quot; That won &apos;t last long .
<unk> Laurence is a crotchety old fellow , and not to be depended on .
So you intend to marry a man without money , position , or business , and go on working harder than you do now , when you might be comfortable all your days by <unk> me and doing better ?
I thought you had more sense , Meg . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t do better if I waited half my life !
John is good and wise ; he &apos;s got heaps of talent ; he &apos;s willing to work , and sure to get on , he &apos;s so energetic and brave .
Every one likes and respects him , and I &apos;m proud to think he cares for me , though I &apos;m so poor and young and silly , &quot; said Meg , looking prettier than ever in her earnestness .
&quot; He knows _ you _ have got rich relations , child ; that &apos;s the secret of his liking , I suspect . &quot;
&quot; Aunt March , how dare you say such a thing ?
John is above such <unk> , and I won &apos;t listen to you a minute if you talk so , &quot; cried Meg indignantly , forgetting everything but the <unk> of the old lady &apos;s suspicions .
&quot; My John wouldn &apos;t marry for money , <unk> than I would .
We are willing to work , and we mean to wait .
I &apos;m not afraid of being poor , for I &apos;ve been happy so far , and I know I shall be with him , because he loves me , and <unk> &quot; Meg stopped there , remembering all of a sudden that she hadn &apos;t made up her mind ; that she had told &quot; her John &quot; to go away , and that he might be <unk> her <unk> remarks .
Aunt March was very angry , for she had set her heart on having her pretty <unk> make a fine match , and something in the girl &apos;s happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour .
&quot; Well , I wash my hands of the whole affair !
You are a wilful child , and you &apos;ve lost more than you know by this piece of folly .
No , I won &apos;t stop ; I &apos;m disappointed in you , and haven &apos;t spirits to see your father now .
Don &apos;t expect anything from me when you are married ; your Mr. Book &apos;s friends must take care of you .
I &apos;m done with you forever . &quot;
And , slamming the door in Meg &apos;s face , Aunt March drove off in high <unk> .
She seemed to take all the girl &apos;s courage with her ; for , when left alone , Meg stood a moment , undecided whether to laugh or cry .
Before she could make up her mind , she was taken possession of by Mr. Brooke , who said , all in one breath , &quot; I couldn &apos;t help hearing , Meg .
Thank you for <unk> me , and Aunt March for proving that you _ do _ care for me a little bit . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t know how much , till she <unk> you , &quot; began Meg .
&quot; And I needn &apos;t go away , but may stay and be happy , may I , dear ? &quot;
Here was another fine chance to make the <unk> speech and the stately <unk> , but Meg never thought of doing either , and disgraced herself forever in Jo &apos;s eyes by meekly whispering , &quot; Yes , John , &quot; and hiding her face on Mr. Brooke &apos;s waistcoat .
<unk> minutes after Aunt March &apos;s departure , Jo came softly down stairs , paused an instant at the parlor door , and , hearing no sound within , nodded and smiled , with a satisfied expression , saying to herself , &quot; She has sent him away as we planned , and that affair is settled .
I &apos;ll go and hear the fun , and have a good laugh over it . &quot;
But poor Jo never got her laugh , for she was <unk> upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there , staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes .
Going in to exult over a fallen enemy , and to praise a strong-minded sister for the <unk> of an <unk> lover , it certainly _ was _ a shock to behold the <unk> enemy <unk> sitting on the sofa , with the strong-minded sister <unk> upon his knee , and wearing an expression of the most abject <unk> .
Jo gave a sort of <unk> , as if a cold <unk> had suddenly fallen upon her , --for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away .
At the odd sound , the lovers turned and saw her .
Meg jumped up , looking both proud and shy ; but &quot; that man , &quot; as Jo called him , actually laughed , and said <unk> , as he kissed the astonished new-comer , &quot; <unk> Jo , congratulate us ! &quot;
That was adding insult to <unk> , --it was altogether too much , --and , making some wild <unk> with her hands , Jo vanished without a word .
<unk> upstairs , she startled the invalids by exclaiming tragically , as she burst into the room , &quot; Oh , _ do _ somebody go down quick ; John Brooke is acting dreadfully , and Meg likes it ! &quot;
Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed ; and , <unk> herself upon the bed , Jo cried and scolded <unk> as she told the awful news to Beth and Amy .
The little girls , however , considered it a most agreeable and interesting event , and Jo got little comfort from them ; so she went up to her refuge in the garret , and confided her troubles to the <unk> .
Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon ; but a great deal of talking was done , and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit , told his plans , and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it .
The tea-bell rang before he had finished <unk> the paradise which he meant to earn for Meg , and he proudly took her in to supper , both looking so happy that Jo hadn &apos;t the heart to be jealous or dismal .
Amy was very much impressed by John &apos;s devotion and Meg &apos;s dignity .
Beth beamed at them from a distance , while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident Aunt March was right in calling them as &quot; unworldly as a pair of babies . &quot;
No one ate much , but every one looked very happy , and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there .
&quot; You can &apos;t say nothing pleasant ever happens now , can you , Meg ? &quot;
said Amy , trying to decide how she would group the lovers in the sketch she was planning to take .
&quot; No , I &apos;m sure I can &apos;t .
How much has happened since I said that !
It seems a year ago , &quot; answered Meg , who was in a blissful dream , lifted far above such common things as bread and butter .
&quot; The joys come close upon the sorrows this time , and I rather think the changes have begun , &quot; said Mrs. March .
&quot; In most families there comes , now and then , a year full of events ; this has been such an one , but it ends well , after all . &quot;
&quot; Hope the next will end better , &quot; muttered Jo , who found it very hard to see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face ; for Jo loved a few persons very dearly , and dreaded to have their affection lost or lessened in any way .
&quot; I hope the third year from this _ will _ end better ; I mean it shall , if I live to work out my plans , &quot; said Mr. Brooke , smiling at Meg , as if everything had become possible to him now .
&quot; Doesn &apos;t it seem very long to wait ? &quot;
asked Amy , who was in a hurry for the wedding .
&quot; I &apos;ve got so much to learn before I shall be ready , it seems a short time to me , &quot; answered Meg , with a sweet gravity in her face , never seen there before .
&quot; You have only to wait ; _ I _ am to do the work , &quot; said John , beginning his labors by picking up Meg &apos;s napkin , with an expression which caused Jo to shake her head , and then say to herself , with an air of relief , as the front door <unk> , &quot; Here comes Laurie .
Now we shall have a little sensible conversation . &quot;
But Jo was mistaken ; for Laurie came prancing in , <unk> with spirits , bearing a great <unk> bouquet for &quot; Mrs. John Brooke , &quot; and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management .
&#91; Illustration : For Mrs. John Brooke &#93; &quot; I knew Brooke would have it all his own way , he always does ; for when he makes up his mind to <unk> anything , it &apos;s done , though the sky falls , &quot; said Laurie , when he had presented his offering and his congratulations .
&quot; Much obliged for that <unk> .
I take it as a good omen for the future , and invite you to my wedding on the spot , &quot; answered Mr. Brooke , who felt at peace with all mankind , even his mischievous pupil .
&quot; I &apos;ll come if I &apos;m at the ends of the earth ; for the sight of Jo &apos;s face alone , on that occasion , would be worth a long journey .
You don &apos;t look festive , ma &apos;am ; what &apos;s the matter ? &quot;
asked Laurie , following her into a corner of the parlor , whither all had <unk> to greet Mr. Laurence .
&quot; I don &apos;t approve of the match , but I &apos;ve made up my mind to bear it , and shall not say a word against it , &quot; said Jo solemnly .
&quot; You can &apos;t know how hard it is for me to give up Meg , &quot; she continued , with a little quiver in her voice .
&quot; You don &apos;t give her up .
You only go halves , &quot; said Laurie consolingly .
&quot; It never can be the same again .
I &apos;ve lost my dearest friend , &quot; sighed Jo .
&quot; You &apos;ve got me , <unk> .
I &apos;m not good for much , I know ; but I &apos;ll stand by you , Jo , all the days of my life ; upon my word I will ! &quot;
and Laurie meant what he said .
&quot; I know you will , and I &apos;m ever so much obliged ; you are always a great comfort to me , Teddy , &quot; returned Jo , gratefully shaking hands .
&quot; Well , now , don &apos;t be dismal , there &apos;s a good fellow .
It &apos;s all right , you see .
Meg is happy ; Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately ; grandpa will attend to him , and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her own little house .
We &apos;ll have capital times after she is gone , for I shall be through college before long , and then we &apos;ll go abroad , or some nice trip or other .
Wouldn &apos;t that console you ? &quot;
&quot; I rather think it would ; but there &apos;s no knowing what may happen in three years , &quot; said Jo thoughtfully .
&quot; That &apos;s true .
Don &apos;t you wish you could take a look forward , and see where we shall all be then ?
I do , &quot; returned Laurie .
&quot; I think not , for I might see something sad ; and every one looks so happy now , I don &apos;t believe they could be much improved , &quot; and Jo &apos;s eyes went slowly round the room , brightening as they looked , for the prospect was a pleasant one .
Father and mother sat together , quietly <unk> the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago .
Amy was drawing the lovers , who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own , the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy .
Beth lay on her sofa , talking <unk> with her old friend , who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked .
Jo lounged in her favorite low seat , with the grave , quiet look which best became her ; and Laurie , leaning on the back of her chair , his chin on a <unk> with her curly head , smiled with his friendliest aspect , and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both .
* * * * * So <unk> , the curtain falls upon Meg , Jo , Beth , and Amy .
Whether it ever <unk> again , depends upon the reception given to the first act of the domestic <unk> called &quot; LITTLE WOMEN . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Home of the Little Women &#93; The <unk> Part &#91; Illustration : The <unk> <unk> &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
In order that we may start <unk> , and go to Meg &apos;s wedding with free minds , it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches .
And here let me <unk> , that if any of the elders think there is too much &quot; lovering &quot; in the story , as I fear they may ( I &apos;m not afraid the young folks will make that objection ) , I can only say with Mrs. March , &quot; What _ can _ you expect when I have four gay girls in the house , and a dashing young neighbor over the way ? &quot;
The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family .
The war is over , and Mr. March safely at home , busy with his books and the small <unk> which found in him a minister by nature as by grace , --a quiet , studious man , rich in the wisdom that is better than learning , the charity which calls all mankind &quot; brother , &quot; the <unk> that <unk> into character , making it <unk> and lovely .
These <unk> , in spite of poverty and the <unk> <unk> which shut him out from the more worldly successes , attracted to him many <unk> persons , as naturally as sweet <unk> draw bees , and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had <unk> no bitter drop .
<unk> young men found the <unk> scholar as young at heart as they ; thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts and sorrows to him , sure of finding the <unk> sympathy , the wisest <unk> ; sinners told their sins to the <unk> old man , and were both <unk> and saved ; gifted men found a companion in him ; ambitious men caught glimpses of <unk> <unk> than their own ; and even <unk> confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true , although &quot; they wouldn &apos;t pay . &quot;
To <unk> , the five energetic women seemed to rule the house , and so they did in many things ; but the quiet scholar , sitting among his books , was still the head of the family , the household conscience , <unk> , and <unk> ; for to him the busy , anxious women always turned in <unk> times , finding him , in the <unk> sense of those sacred words , husband and father .
The girls gave their hearts into their mother &apos;s keeping , their souls into their father &apos;s ; and to both parents , who lived and labored so faithfully for them , they gave a love that grew with their <unk> , and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which <unk> life and <unk> death .
Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery , though rather <unk> , than when we saw her last , and just now so absorbed in Meg &apos;s affairs that the <unk> and homes , still full of wounded &quot; boys &quot; and soldiers &apos; <unk> , decidedly miss the motherly <unk> &apos;s visits .
John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year , got wounded , was sent home , and not allowed to return .
He received no stars or bars , but he deserved them , for he cheerfully <unk> all he had ; and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom .
<unk> resigned to his <unk> , he devoted himself to getting well , preparing for business , and <unk> a home for Meg .
With the good sense and <unk> independence that <unk> him , he refused Mr. Laurence &apos;s more generous offers , and accepted the place of <unk> feeling better satisfied to begin with an <unk> salary , than by running any <unk> with borrowed money .
Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting , growing womanly in character , wise in housewifely <unk> , and prettier than ever ; for love is a great <unk> .
She had her girlish <unk> and hopes , and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin .
Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner , and Meg couldn &apos;t help <unk> their fine house and carriage , many gifts , and splendid <unk> , with her own , and secretly wishing she could have the same .
But somehow envy and <unk> soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little home <unk> her ; and when they sat together in the twilight , talking over their small plans , the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot Sallie &apos;s splendor , and felt herself the <unk> , happiest girl in <unk> .
Jo never went back to Aunt March , for the old lady took such a fancy to Amy that she <unk> her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going ; and for the sake of this advantage , Amy would have served a far harder mistress .
So she gave her <unk> to duty , her afternoons to pleasure , and <unk> finely .
Jo , meantime , devoted herself to literature and Beth , who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past .
Not an invalid exactly , but never again the rosy , healthy creature she had been ; yet always hopeful , happy , and serene , busy with the quiet duties she loved , every one &apos;s friend , and an angel in the house , long before those who loved her most had learned to know it .
As long as &quot; The Spread Eagle &quot; paid her a dollar a <unk> for her &quot; rubbish , &quot; as she called it , Jo felt herself a woman of means , and spun her little romances diligently .
But great plans <unk> in her busy brain and ambitious mind , and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript , which was one day to place the name of March upon the roll of fame .
Laurie , having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather , was now getting through it in the <unk> possible manner to please himself .
A <unk> favorite , thanks to money , manners , much talent , and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them , he stood in great danger of being spoilt , and probably would have been , like many another promising boy , if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success , the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son , and last , but not least by any means , the knowledge that four innocent girls loved , admired , and believed in him with all their hearts .
Being only &quot; a glorious human boy , &quot; of course he frolicked and flirted , grew <unk> , <unk> , sentimental , or <unk> , as college fashions <unk> ; <unk> and was <unk> , talked slang , and more than once came <unk> near <unk> and <unk> .
But as high spirits and the love of fun were the <unk> of these pranks , he always managed to save himself by frank <unk> , honorable <unk> , or the irresistible power of <unk> which he possessed in perfection .
In fact , he rather prided himself on his narrow <unk> , and liked to thrill the girls with <unk> accounts of his <unk> over wrathful <unk> , dignified <unk> , and <unk> enemies .
The &quot; men of my class &quot; were heroes in the eyes of the girls , who never wearied of the <unk> of &quot; our fellows , &quot; and were frequently allowed to <unk> in the smiles of these great creatures , when Laurie brought them home with him .
Amy especially enjoyed this high honor , and became quite a belle among them ; for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of <unk> with which she was <unk> .
Meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular John to care for any other lords of creation , and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them , and wonder how Amy dared to order them about so ; but Jo felt quite in her element , and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes , phrases , and <unk> , which seemed more natural to her than the <unk> <unk> for young ladies .
They all liked Jo immensely , but never fell in love with her , though very few escaped without paying the <unk> of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy &apos;s shrine .
And speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the &quot; Dove-cote . &quot;
That was the name of the little brown house which Mr. Brooke had prepared for Meg &apos;s first home .
Laurie had <unk> it , saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers , who &quot; went on together like a pair of turtle-doves , with first a bill and then a <unk> . &quot;
It was a tiny house , with a little garden behind , and a lawn about as big as a <unk> in front .
Here Meg meant to have a fountain , <unk> , and a <unk> of lovely flowers ; though just at present , the fountain was represented by a <unk> <unk> , very like a dilapidated <unk> ; the <unk> <unk> of several young <unk> , undecided whether to live or die ; and the <unk> of flowers was merely hinted by <unk> of sticks , to show where <unk> were <unk> .
But inside , it was altogether charming , and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar .
To be sure , the hall was so narrow , it was fortunate that they had no piano , for one never could have been got in whole ; the dining-room was so small that six people were a tight fit ; and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of <unk> both servants and china pell-mell into the <unk> .
But once get used to these slight blemishes , and nothing could be more complete , for good sense and good taste had presided over the <unk> , and the result was highly satisfactory .
There were no <unk> tables , long <unk> , or lace curtains in the little parlor , but simple furniture , plenty of books , a fine picture or two , a stand of flowers in the <unk> , and , scattered all about , the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands , and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought .
I don &apos;t think the <unk> <unk> Laurie gave lost any of its beauty because John put up the <unk> it stood upon ; that any <unk> could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy &apos;s artistic hand ; or that any <unk> was ever better provided with good wishes , merry words , and happy hopes , than that in which Jo and her mother put away Meg &apos;s few boxes , <unk> , and bundles ; and I am <unk> certain that the <unk> kitchen never _ could _ have looked so cosey and neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and <unk> a dozen times over , and laid the fire all ready for <unk> , the minute &quot; <unk> .
Brooke came home . &quot;
I also doubt if any young <unk> ever began life with so rich a supply of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; for Beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round , and invented three different kinds of <unk> for the express service of the bridal china .
People who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose ; for the <unk> tasks get beautified if loving hands do them , and Meg found so many proofs of this , that everything in her small nest , from the kitchen <unk> to the silver vase on her parlor table , was eloquent of home love and tender forethought .
What happy times they had planning together , what solemn shopping <unk> ; what funny mistakes they made , and what <unk> of laughter arose over Laurie &apos;s ridiculous <unk> .
In his love of jokes , this young gentleman , though nearly through college , was as much of a boy as ever .
His last <unk> had been to bring with him , on his weekly visits , some new , useful , and <unk> article for the young housekeeper .
Now a bag of remarkable <unk> ; next , a wonderful <unk> , which fell to pieces at the first trial ; a <unk> that spoilt all the <unk> ; or a <unk> that picked the nap neatly off the carpet , and left the dirt ; <unk> soap that took the skin off one &apos;s hands ; <unk> <unk> which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the <unk> <unk> ; and every kind of <unk> , from a <unk> <unk> for odd <unk> , to a wonderful <unk> which would wash articles in its own <unk> , with every prospect of <unk> in the process .
In vain Meg begged him to stop .
John laughed at him , and Jo called him &quot; Mr.
<unk> . &quot;
He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee <unk> , and seeing his friends <unk> furnished forth .
So each week beheld some fresh <unk> .
Everything was done at last , even to Amy &apos;s arranging different colored <unk> to match the different colored rooms , and Beth &apos;s setting the table for the first <unk> .
&quot; Are you satisfied ?
Does it seem like home , and do you feel as if you should be happy here ? &quot;
asked Mrs. March , as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom , arm-in-arm ; for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever .
&quot; Yes , mother , perfectly satisfied , thanks to you all , and _ so _ happy that I can &apos;t talk about it , &quot; answered Meg , with a look that was better than words .
&quot; If she only had a servant or two it would be all right , &quot; said Amy , coming out of the parlor , where she had been trying to decide whether the <unk> <unk> looked best on the <unk> or the <unk> .
&quot; Mother and I have talked that over , and I have made up my mind to try her way first .
There will be so little to do , that , with Lotty to run my errands and help me here and there , I shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick , &quot; answered Meg <unk> .
&quot; Sallie Moffat has four , &quot; began Amy .
&quot; If Meg had four the house wouldn &apos;t hold them , and master and <unk> would have to camp in the garden , &quot; broke in Jo , who , enveloped in a big blue pinafore , was giving the last polish to the <unk> .
&quot; Sallie isn &apos;t a poor man &apos;s wife , and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment .
Meg and John begin humbly , but I have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one .
It &apos;s a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress , give orders , and gossip .
When I was first married , I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn , so that I might have the pleasure of mending them ; for I got heartily sick of doing fancy work and <unk> my pocket handkerchief . &quot;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you go into the kitchen and make messes , as Sallie says she does , to amuse herself , though they never turn out well , and the servants laugh at her , &quot; said Meg .
&quot; I did , after a while ; not to &apos; mess , &apos; but to learn of Hannah how things should be done , that my servants need _ not _ laugh at me .
It was play then ; but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls , and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help .
You begin at the other end , Meg , dear ; but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you by and by , when John is a richer man , for the mistress of a house , however splendid , should know how work ought to be done , if she wishes to be well and honestly served . &quot;
&quot; Yes , mother , I &apos;m sure of that , &quot; said Meg , listening respectfully to the little lecture ; for the best of women will hold forth upon the all-absorbing subject of housekeeping .
&quot; Do you know I like this room most of all in my <unk> , &quot; added Meg , a minute after , as they went upstairs , and she looked into her <unk> <unk> .
Beth was there , laying the snowy piles smoothly on the <unk> , and <unk> over the <unk> array .
All three laughed as Meg spoke ; for that <unk> was a joke .
You see , having said that if Meg married &quot; that Brooke &quot; she shouldn &apos;t have a <unk> of her money , Aunt March was rather in a <unk> , when time had appeased her wrath and made her <unk> her <unk> .
She never broke her word , and was much <unk> in her mind how to get round it , and at last <unk> a plan <unk> she could satisfy herself .
Mrs. Carrol , <unk> &apos;s mamma , was ordered to buy , have made , and marked , a generous supply of house and table linen , and send it as _ her _ present , all of which was faithfully done ; but the secret <unk> out , and was greatly enjoyed by the family ; for Aunt March tried to look utterly unconscious , and insisted that she could give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls , long promised to the first bride .
&quot; That &apos;s a housewifely taste which I am glad to see .
I had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets , but she had finger <unk> for company , and that satisfied her , &quot; said Mrs. March , patting the <unk> <unk> , with a truly feminine <unk> of their <unk> .
&quot; I haven &apos;t a single <unk> , but this is a &apos; set out &apos; that will last me all my days , Hannah says ; &quot; and Meg looked quite contented , as well she might .
&quot; <unk> is coming , &quot; cried Jo from below ; and they all went down to meet Laurie , whose weekly visit was an important event in their quiet lives .
A tall , <unk> young fellow , with a <unk> head , a <unk> of a hat , and a fly-away coat , came tramping down the road at a great pace , walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate , straight up to Mrs. March , with both hands out , and a <unk> &quot; Here I am , mother !
Yes , it &apos;s all right . &quot;
The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him ; a kindly <unk> look , which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed , as usual , with a motherly kiss .
&quot; For Mrs. John Brooke , with the <unk> &apos;s congratulations and compliments .
Bless you , Beth !
What a refreshing spectacle you are , Jo .
Amy , you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady . &quot;
As Laurie spoke , he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg , pulled Beth &apos;s <unk> , stared at Jo &apos;s big pinafore , and fell into an attitude of <unk> rapture before Amy , then shook hands all round , and every one began to talk .
&quot; Where is John ? &quot;
asked Meg anxiously .
&quot; <unk> to get the license for to-morrow , ma &apos;am . &quot;
&quot; Which side won the last match , Teddy ? &quot;
inquired Jo , who persisted in feeling an interest in manly <unk> , <unk> her nineteen years .
&quot; <unk> , of course .
Wish you &apos;d been there to see . &quot;
&quot; How is the lovely Miss Randal ? &quot;
asked Amy , with a <unk> smile .
&quot; More cruel than ever ; don &apos;t you see how I &apos;m pining away ? &quot;
and Laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and <unk> a melodramatic sigh .
&quot; What &apos;s the last joke ?
<unk> the bundle and see , Meg , &quot; said Beth , eying the knobby parcel with curiosity .
&quot; It &apos;s a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or <unk> , &quot; observed Laurie , as a watchman &apos;s rattle appeared , <unk> the laughter of the girls .
&#91; Illustration : A small watchman &apos;s rattle &#93; &quot; Any time when John is away , and you get frightened , Mrs. Meg , just swing that out of the front window , and it will <unk> the neighborhood in a jiffy .
Nice thing , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
and Laurie gave them a <unk> of its powers that made them cover up their ears .
&quot; There &apos;s gratitude for you !
and speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your <unk> from <unk> .
I saw it going into your house as I came by , and if she hadn &apos;t defended it manfully I &apos;d have had a pick at it , for it looked like a remarkably <unk> one . &quot;
&quot; I wonder if you will ever grow up , Laurie , &quot; said Meg , in a matronly tone .
&quot; I &apos;m doing my best , ma &apos;am , but can &apos;t get much higher , I &apos;m afraid , as six feet is about all men can do in these <unk> days , &quot; <unk> the young gentleman , whose head was about <unk> with the little <unk> .
&quot; I suppose it would be <unk> to eat anything in this <unk> and <unk> new bower , so , as I &apos;m tremendously hungry , I propose an <unk> , &quot; he added presently .
&quot; Mother and I are going to wait for John .
There are some last things to settle , &quot; said Meg , <unk> away .
&quot; Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant &apos;s to get more flowers for to-morrow , &quot; added Amy , <unk> a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls , and enjoying the effect as much as anybody .
&quot; Come , Jo , don &apos;t desert a fellow .
I &apos;m in such a state of <unk> I can &apos;t get home without help .
Don &apos;t take off your apron , whatever you do ; it &apos;s peculiarly becoming , &quot; said Laurie , as Jo <unk> his especial aversion in her <unk> pocket , and offered him her arm to support his feeble steps .
&quot; Now , Teddy , I want to talk seriously to you about to-morrow , &quot; began Jo , as they strolled away together .
&quot; You _ must _ promise to behave well , and not cut up any pranks , and spoil our plans . &quot;
&quot; Not a prank . &quot;
&quot; And don &apos;t say funny things when we ought to be sober . &quot;
&quot; I never do ; you are the one for that . &quot;
&quot; And I <unk> you not to look at me during the ceremony ; I shall certainly laugh if you do . &quot;
&quot; You won &apos;t see me ; you &apos;ll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will <unk> the prospect . &quot;
&quot; I never cry unless for some great affliction . &quot;
&quot; Such as fellows going to college , hey ? &quot;
cut in Laurie , with a suggestive laugh .
&quot; Don &apos;t be a peacock .
I only <unk> a trifle to keep the girls company . &quot;
&quot; <unk> .
I say , Jo , how is grandpa this week ; pretty amiable ? &quot;
&quot; Very ; why , have you got into a scrape , and want to know how he &apos;ll take it ? &quot;
asked Jo rather sharply .
&quot; Now , Jo , do you think I &apos;d look your mother in the face , and say &apos; All right , &apos; if it wasn &apos;t ? &quot;
and Laurie stopped short , with an injured air .
&quot; No , I don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; Then don &apos;t go and be suspicious ; I only want some money , &quot; said Laurie , walking on again , appeased by her hearty tone .
&quot; You spend a great deal , Teddy . &quot;
&quot; Bless you , _ I _ don &apos;t spend it ; it <unk> itself , somehow , and is gone before I know it . &quot;
&quot; You are so generous and <unk> that you let people borrow , and can &apos;t say &apos; No &apos; to any one .
We heard about <unk> , and all you did for him .
If you always spent money in that way , no one would blame you , &quot; said Jo warmly .
&quot; Oh , he made a mountain out of a <unk> .
You wouldn &apos;t have me let that fine fellow work himself to death , just for the want of a little help , when he is worth a dozen of us lazy <unk> , would you ? &quot;
&quot; Of course not ; but I don &apos;t see the use of your having seventeen <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and a new hat every time you come home .
I thought you &apos;d got over the <unk> period ; but every now and then it breaks out in a new spot .
Just now it &apos;s the fashion to be <unk> , --to make your head look like a <unk> , wear a <unk> , <unk> gloves , and <unk> , <unk> boots .
If it was cheap <unk> , I &apos;d say nothing ; but it costs as much as the other , and I don &apos;t get any satisfaction out of it . &quot;
Laurie threw back his head , and laughed so heartily at this attack , that the <unk> fell off , and Jo walked on it , which insult only afforded him an opportunity for <unk> on the <unk> of a <unk> costume , as he folded up the <unk> hat , and stuffed it into his pocket .
&quot; Don &apos;t lecture any more , there &apos;s a good soul !
I have enough all through the week , and like to enjoy myself when I come home .
I &apos;ll get myself up regardless of expense , to-morrow , and be a satisfaction to my friends . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll leave you in peace if you &apos;ll _ only _ let your hair grow .
I &apos;m not aristocratic , but I do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young <unk> , &quot; observed Jo <unk> .
&quot; This <unk> style <unk> study ; that &apos;s why we <unk> it , &quot; returned Laurie , who certainly could not be accused of vanity , having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for <unk> <unk> .
&quot; By the way , Jo , I think that little Parker is really getting desperate about Amy .
He talks of her constantly , writes poetry , and <unk> about in a most suspicious manner .
He &apos;d better <unk> his little passion in the <unk> , hadn &apos;t he ? &quot;
added Laurie , in a confidential , <unk> tone , after a minute &apos;s silence .
&quot; Of course he had ; we don &apos;t want any more <unk> in this family for years to come .
Mercy on us , what _ are _ the children thinking of ? &quot;
and Jo looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in their teens .
&quot; It &apos;s a fast age , and I don &apos;t know what we are coming to , ma &apos;am .
You are a mere infant , but you &apos;ll go next , Jo , and we &apos;ll be left <unk> , &quot; said Laurie , shaking his head over the <unk> of the times .
&quot; Don &apos;t be alarmed ; I &apos;m not one of the agreeable sort .
Nobody will want me , and it &apos;s a mercy , for there should always be one old maid in a family . &quot;
&quot; You won &apos;t give any one a chance , &quot; said Laurie , with a <unk> glance , and a little more color than before in his <unk> face .
&quot; You won &apos;t show the soft side of your character ; and if a fellow gets a peep at it by accident , and can &apos;t help showing that he likes it , you treat him as Mrs. <unk> did her <unk> , <unk> cold water over him , --and get so thorny no one <unk> touch or look at you . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t like that sort of thing ; I &apos;m too busy to be worried with nonsense , and I think it &apos;s dreadful to break up families so .
Now don &apos;t say any more about it ; Meg &apos;s wedding has turned all our heads , and we talk of nothing but lovers and such <unk> .
I don &apos;t wish to get cross , so let &apos;s change the subject ; &quot; and Jo looked quite ready to <unk> cold water on the slightest <unk> .
Whatever his feelings might have been , Laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle , and the fearful <unk> , as they parted at the gate , &quot; <unk> my words , Jo , you &apos;ll go next . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : The First <unk> &#93; <unk> .
THE <unk> <unk> .
The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that morning , rejoicing with all their hearts in the <unk> sunshine , like friendly little neighbors , as they were .
Quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces , as they swung in the wind , whispering to one another what they had seen ; for some peeped in at the dining-room windows , where the feast was spread , some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride , others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden , porch , and hall , and all , from the <unk> <unk> flower to the <unk> <unk> , offered their <unk> of beauty and <unk> to the gentle mistress who had loved and <unk> them so long .
Meg looked very like a rose herself ; for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day , making it fair and tender , with a charm more beautiful than beauty .
Neither silk , lace , nor <unk> would she have .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to look strange or fixed up to-day , &quot; she said .
&quot; I don &apos;t want a fashionable wedding , but only those about me whom I love , and to them I wish to look and be my familiar self . &quot;
So she made her wedding gown herself , sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart .
Her sisters <unk> up her pretty hair , and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley , which &quot; her John &quot; liked best of all the flowers that grew .
&quot; You _ do _ look just like our own dear Meg , only so very sweet and lovely that I should hug you if it wouldn &apos;t <unk> your dress , &quot; cried Amy , surveying her with delight , when all was done .
&quot; Then I am satisfied .
But please hug and kiss me , every one , and don &apos;t mind my dress ; I want a great many <unk> of this sort put into it to-day ; &quot; and Meg opened her arms to her sisters , who clung about her with April faces for a minute , feeling that the new love had not changed the old .
&quot; Now I &apos;m going to tie John &apos;s <unk> for him , and then to stay a few minutes with father quietly in the study ; &quot; and Meg ran down to perform these little ceremonies , and then to follow her mother wherever she went , conscious that , in spite of the smiles on the motherly face , there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest .
As the younger girls stand together , giving the last touches to their simple <unk> , it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance ; for all are looking their best just now .
Jo &apos;s <unk> are much softened ; she has learned to carry herself with ease , if not grace .
The curly crop has <unk> into a thick <unk> , more becoming to the small head <unk> of the tall figure .
There is a fresh color in her brown cheeks , a soft shine in her eyes , and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue to-day .
Beth has grown slender , pale , and more quiet than ever ; the beautiful , kind eyes are <unk> , and in them lies an expression that <unk> one , although it is not sad itself .
It is the shadow of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience ; but Beth seldom <unk> , and always speaks hopefully of &quot; being better soon . &quot;
Amy is with truth considered &quot; the flower of the family ; &quot; for at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a <unk> <unk> beautiful , but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace .
One saw it in the lines of her figure , the make and motion of her hands , the <unk> of her dress , the <unk> of her hair , <unk> , yet <unk> , and as attractive to many as beauty itself .
Amy &apos;s nose still afflicted her , for it never _ would _ grow <unk> ; so did her mouth , being too wide , and having a decided chin .
These <unk> <unk> gave character to her whole face , but she never could see it , and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair <unk> , keen blue eyes , and curls , more golden and <unk> than ever .
All three wore suits of thin silver gray ( their best gowns for the summer ) , with <unk> in hair and bosom ; and all three looked just what they were , <unk> , happy-hearted girls , pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood .
There were to be no <unk> performances , everything was to be as natural and homelike as possible ; so when Aunt March arrived , she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in , to find the bridegroom <unk> up a garland that had fallen down , and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave countenance , and a <unk> under each arm .
&quot; Upon my word , here &apos;s a state of things ! &quot;
cried the old lady , taking the seat of honor prepared for her , and settling the folds of her lavender _ <unk> _ with a great rustle .
&quot; You <unk> &apos;t to be seen till the last minute , child . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not a show , aunty , and no one is coming to stare at me , to <unk> my dress , or count the cost of my luncheon .
I &apos;m too happy to care what any one says or thinks , and I &apos;m going to have my little wedding just as I like it .
John , dear , here &apos;s your <unk> ; &quot; and away went Meg to help &quot; that man &quot; in his highly improper <unk> .
Mr. Brooke didn &apos;t even say &quot; Thank you , &quot; but as he stooped for the unromantic <unk> , he kissed his little bride behind the <unk> , with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her <unk> , with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes .
A crash , a cry , and a laugh from Laurie , accompanied by the <unk> exclamation , &quot; Jupiter <unk> !
Jo &apos;s upset the cake again ! &quot;
caused a momentary flurry , which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived , and &quot; the party came in , &quot; as Beth used to say when a child .
&quot; Don &apos;t let that young giant come near me ; he worries me worse than <unk> , &quot; whispered the old lady to Amy , as the rooms filled , and Laurie &apos;s black head <unk> above the rest .
&quot; He has promised to be very good to-day , and he _ can _ be perfectly elegant if he likes , &quot; returned Amy , <unk> away to warn <unk> to <unk> of the <unk> , which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her .
There was no bridal procession , but a sudden silence fell upon the room as Mr. March and the young pair took their places under the green arch .
Mother and sisters gathered close , as if <unk> to give Meg up ; the fatherly voice broke more than once , which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn ; the bridegroom &apos;s hand trembled <unk> , and no one heard his <unk> ; but Meg looked straight up in her husband &apos;s eyes , and said , &quot; I will ! &quot;
with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mother &apos;s heart rejoiced , and Aunt March sniffed <unk> .
Jo did _ not _ cry , though she was very near it once , and was only saved from a <unk> by the consciousness that Laurie was staring <unk> at her , with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes .
Beth kept her face hidden on her mother &apos;s shoulder , but Amy stood like a graceful statue , with a most becoming <unk> of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair .
It wasn &apos;t at all the thing , I &apos;m afraid , but the minute she was fairly married , Meg cried , &quot; The first kiss for Marmee ! &quot;
and , turning , gave it with her heart on her lips .
During the next fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever , for every one <unk> themselves of their <unk> to the fullest extent , from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah , who , adorned with a <unk> <unk> and wonderfully made , fell upon her in the hall , crying , with a sob and a <unk> , &quot; Bless you , deary , a hundred times !
The cake ain &apos;t hurt a mite , and everything looks lovely . &quot;
Everybody cleared up after that , and said something brilliant , or tried to , which did just as well , for laughter is ready when hearts are light .
There was no display of gifts , for they were already in the little house , nor was there an <unk> breakfast , but a <unk> lunch of cake and fruit , dressed with flowers .
Mr. Laurence and Aunt March <unk> and smiled at one another when water , lemonade , and coffee were found to be the only sorts of <unk> which the three <unk> carried round .
No one said anything , however , till Laurie , who insisted on <unk> the bride , appeared before her , with a loaded <unk> in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face .
&quot; Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident ? &quot;
he whispered , &quot; or am I merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this morning ? &quot;
&quot; No ; your grandfather kindly offered us his best , and Aunt March actually sent some , but father put away a little for Beth , and despatched the rest to the <unk> &apos; Home .
You know he thinks that wine should be used only in illness , and mother says that neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof . &quot;
Meg spoke seriously , and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh ; but he did neither , for after a quick look at her , he said , in his impetuous way , &quot; I like that !
for I &apos;ve seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do . &quot;
&quot; You are not made wise by experience , I hope ? &quot;
and there was an anxious accent in Meg &apos;s voice .
&quot; No ; I give you my word for it .
Don &apos;t think too well of me , either ; this is not one of my temptations .
Being brought up where wine is as common as water , and almost as harmless , I don &apos;t care for it ; but when a pretty girl offers it , one doesn &apos;t like to refuse , you see . &quot;
&quot; But you will , for the sake of others , if not for your own .
Come , Laurie , promise , and give me one more reason to call this the happiest day of my life . &quot;
A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man <unk> a moment , for <unk> is often harder to bear than self-denial .
Meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs ; and , feeling her power , used it as a woman may for her friend &apos;s good .
She did not speak , but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness , and a smile which said , &quot; No one can refuse me anything to-day . &quot;
Laurie certainly could not ; and , with an <unk> smile , he gave her his hand , saying heartily , &quot; I promise , Mrs.
Brooke ! &quot;
&quot; I thank you , very , very much . &quot;
&quot; And I drink &apos; long life to your resolution , &apos; Teddy , &quot; cried Jo , <unk> him with a splash of lemonade , as she waved her glass , and beamed approvingly upon him .
So the toast was drunk , the <unk> made , and <unk> kept , in spite of many temptations ; for , with <unk> wisdom , the girls had seized a happy moment to do their friend a service , for which he thanked them all his life .
After lunch , people strolled about , by <unk> and <unk> , through house and garden , enjoying the sunshine without and within .
Meg and John happened to be standing together in the middle of the <unk> , when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to this <unk> wedding .
&quot; All the married people take hands and dance round the <unk> husband and wife , as the Germans do , while we <unk> and <unk> <unk> in couples outside ! &quot;
cried Laurie , <unk> down the path with Amy , with such <unk> spirit and skill that every one else followed their example without a murmur .
Mr. and Mrs. March , Aunt and Uncle Carrol , began it ; others rapidly joined in ; even Sallie Moffat , after a moment &apos;s <unk> , threw her train over her arm , and whisked Ned into the ring .
But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March ; for when the stately old gentleman _ <unk> ? <unk> _ solemnly up to the old lady , she just tucked her cane under her arm , and <unk> briskly away to join hands with the rest , and dance about the bridal pair , while the young folks pervaded the garden , like <unk> on a midsummer day .
Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close , and then people began to go .
&quot; I wish you well , my dear , I heartily wish you well ; but I think you &apos;ll be sorry for it , &quot; said Aunt March to Meg , adding to the bridegroom , as he led her to the carriage , &quot; You &apos;ve got a treasure , young man , see that you deserve it . &quot;
&quot; That is the prettiest wedding I &apos;ve been to for an age , Ned , and I don &apos;t see why , for there wasn &apos;t a bit of style about it , &quot; observed Mrs. Moffat to her husband , as they drove away .
&quot; Laurie , my lad , if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing , get one of those little girls to help you , and I shall be perfectly satisfied , &quot; said Mr. Laurence , settling himself in his easy-chair to rest , after the excitement of the morning .
&quot; I &apos;ll do my best to <unk> you , sir , &quot; was Laurie &apos;s unusually dutiful reply , as he carefully <unk> the posy Jo had put in his button-hole .
The little house was not far away , and the only bridal journey Meg had was the quiet walk with John , from the old home to the new .
When she came down , looking like a pretty <unk> in her dove-colored suit and <unk> bonnet tied with white , they all gathered about her to say &quot; good-by , &quot; as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour .
&quot; Don &apos;t feel that I am separated from you , Marmee dear , or that I love you any the less for loving John so much , &quot; she said , clinging to her mother , with full eyes , for a moment .
&quot; I shall come every day , father , and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts , though I _ am _ married .
Beth is going to be with me a great deal , and the other girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles .
Thank you all for my happy <unk> .
Good-by , good-by ! &quot;
They stood watching her , with faces full of love and hope and tender pride , as she walked away , leaning on her husband &apos;s arm , with her hands full of flowers , and the June sunshine brightening her happy face , --and so Meg &apos;s married life began .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> <unk> &#93; <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and genius , especially ambitious young men and women .
Amy was learning this <unk> through much <unk> ; for , <unk> enthusiasm for inspiration , she <unk> every <unk> of art with youthful audacity .
For a long time there was a lull in the &quot; <unk> &quot; business , and she devoted herself to the finest <unk> drawing , in which she showed such taste and skill that her graceful <unk> proved both pleasant and profitable .
But <unk> eyes soon caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at <unk> .
While this attack lasted , the family lived in constant fear of a <unk> ; for the <unk> of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours ; smoke issued from <unk> and shed with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> lay about <unk> , and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the <unk> at her door , in case of fire .
Raphael &apos;s face was found boldly <unk> on the under side of the <unk> , and <unk> on the head of a <unk> ; a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the <unk> , and attempts to <unk> <unk> and <unk> supplied <unk> for some time .
From fire to <unk> was a natural <unk> for burnt fingers , and Amy fell to <unk> with <unk> ardor .
An artist friend fitted her out with his <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and colors ; and she <unk> away , producing <unk> and <unk> views such as were never seen on land or sea .
Her <unk> in the way of <unk> would have taken <unk> at an <unk> fair ; and the perilous <unk> of her <unk> would have produced <unk> in the most <unk> <unk> , if the utter <unk> to all known rules of <unk> and <unk> had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance .
<unk> boys and <unk> <unk> , staring at you from one corner of the <unk> , suggested <unk> ; <unk> <unk> of faces , with a <unk> streak in the wrong place , meant <unk> ; <unk> ladies and <unk> infants , <unk> ; and <unk> appeared in <unk> of blue <unk> , <unk> <unk> , brown rain , and purple clouds , with a <unk> splash in the middle , which might be the sun or a <unk> , a <unk> &apos;s <unk> or a king &apos;s <unk> , as the <unk> pleased .
<unk> portraits came next ; and the entire family hung in a row , looking as wild and <unk> as if just <unk> from a <unk> .
<unk> into <unk> sketches , they did better ; for the <unk> were good , and Amy &apos;s hair , Jo &apos;s nose , Meg &apos;s mouth , and Laurie &apos;s eyes were pronounced &quot; wonderfully fine . &quot;
A return to clay and plaster followed , and <unk> <unk> of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house , or tumbled off <unk> on to people &apos;s heads .
Children were <unk> in as models , till their <unk> accounts of her mysterious <unk> caused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young <unk> .
Her efforts in this line , however , were brought to an <unk> close by an <unk> accident , which quenched her ardor .
Other models failing her for a time , she undertook to cast her own pretty foot , and the family were one day alarmed by an <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and running to the rescue , found the young <unk> <unk> wildly about the shed , with her foot held fast in a <unk> of plaster , which had <unk> with unexpected rapidity .
With much difficulty and some danger she was <unk> out ; for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she <unk> , that her <unk> went too far , cut the poor foot , and left a <unk> <unk> of one artistic attempt , at least .
&#91; Illustration : Her foot held fast in a <unk> of plaster &#93; After this Amy subsided , till a mania for sketching from nature set her to <unk> river , field , and wood , for picturesque <unk> , and <unk> for ruins to copy .
She caught <unk> <unk> sitting on damp grass to book &quot; a delicious bit , &quot; composed of a stone , a <unk> , one <unk> , and a broken <unk> , or &quot; a heavenly <unk> of clouds , &quot; that looked like a <unk> display of <unk> when done .
She sacrificed her <unk> floating on the river in the midsummer sun , to study light and shade , and got a <unk> over her nose , trying after &quot; points of sight , &quot; or whatever the <unk> performance is called .
If &quot; genius is <unk> patience , &quot; as <unk> <unk> <unk> , Amy certainly had some claim to the divine <unk> , for she <unk> in spite of all obstacles , failures , and <unk> , firmly believing that in time she should do something worthy to be called &quot; high art . &quot;
She was learning , doing , and enjoying other things , meanwhile , for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman , even if she never became a great artist .
Here she succeeded better ; for she was one of those happily created beings who please without effort , make friends everywhere , and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky <unk> .
Everybody liked her , for among her good gifts was tact .
She had an <unk> sense of what was pleasing and proper , always said the right thing to the right person , did just what suited the time and place , and was so <unk> that her sisters used to say , &quot; If Amy went to <unk> without any <unk> beforehand , she &apos;d know exactly what to do . &quot;
One of her <unk> was a desire to move in &quot; our best society , &quot; without being quite sure what the _ best _ really was .
Money , position , fashionable accomplishments , and elegant manners were most desirable things in her eyes , and she liked to associate with those who possessed them , often <unk> the <unk> for the true , and admiring what was not <unk> .
Never forgetting that by <unk> she was a gentlewoman , she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings , so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty now <unk> her .
&quot; My lady , &quot; as her friends called her , sincerely desired to be a genuine lady , and was so at heart , but had yet to learn that money cannot buy <unk> of nature , that rank does not always <unk> nobility , and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of <unk> <unk> .
&quot; I want to ask a favor of you , mamma , &quot; Amy said , coming in , with an important air , one day .
&quot; Well , little girl , what is it ? &quot;
replied her mother , in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained &quot; the baby . &quot;
&quot; Our drawing class breaks up next week , and before the girls separate for the summer , I want to ask them out here for a day .
They are wild to see the river , sketch the broken bridge , and copy some of the things they admire in my book .
They have been very kind to me in many ways , and I am grateful , for they are all rich , and know I am poor , yet they never made any difference . &quot;
&quot; Why should they ? &quot;
and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls called her &quot; <unk> <unk> air . &quot;
&quot; You know as well as I that it _ does _ make a difference with nearly every one , so don &apos;t <unk> up , like a dear , motherly <unk> , when your <unk> get <unk> by <unk> birds ; the ugly <unk> turned out a <unk> , you know ; &quot; and Amy smiled without bitterness , for she possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit .
Mrs. March laughed , and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked , -- &quot; Well , my <unk> , what is your plan ? &quot;
&quot; I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week , to take them a drive to the places they want to see , a row on the river , perhaps , and make a little artistic _ f ? te _ for them . &quot;
&quot; That looks <unk> .
What do you want for lunch ?
<unk> , <unk> , fruit , and coffee will be all that is necessary , I suppose ? &quot;
&quot; Oh dear , no !
we must have cold tongue and chicken , French chocolate and ice-cream , <unk> .
The girls are used to such things , and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant , though I _ do _ work for my living . &quot;
&quot; How many young ladies are there ? &quot;
asked her mother , beginning to look sober .
&quot; <unk> or <unk> in the class , but I dare say they won &apos;t all come . &quot;
&quot; Bless me , child , you will have to <unk> an omnibus to carry them about . &quot;
&quot; Why , mother , how _ can _ you think of such a thing ?
Not more than six or eight will probably come , so I shall hire a <unk> , and borrow Mr. Laurence &apos;s cherry-bounce . &quot;
( Hannah &apos;s pronunciation of _ <unk> ? <unk> _ . )
&quot; All this will be <unk> , Amy . &quot;
&quot; Not very ; I &apos;ve <unk> the cost , and I &apos;ll pay for it myself . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you think , dear , that as these girls are used to such things , and the best we can do will be nothing new , that some <unk> plan would be pleasanter to them , as a change , if nothing more , and much better for us than buying or <unk> what we don &apos;t need , and <unk> a style not in keeping with our circumstances ? &quot;
&quot; If I can &apos;t have it as I like , I don &apos;t care to have it at all .
I know that I can carry it out perfectly well , if you and the girls will help a little ; and I don &apos;t see why I can &apos;t if I &apos;m willing to pay for it , &quot; said Amy , with the decision which opposition was apt to change into obstinacy .
Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher , and when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she would gladly have made easier , if they had not objected to taking advice as much as they did <unk> and <unk> .
&quot; Very well , Amy ; if your heart is set upon it , and you see your way through without too great an <unk> of money , time , and temper , I &apos;ll say no more .
Talk it over with the girls , and <unk> way you decide , I &apos;ll do my best to help you . &quot;
&quot; Thanks , mother ; you are always _ so _ kind ; &quot; and away went Amy to lay her plan before her sisters .
Meg agreed at once , and promised her <unk> , gladly offering anything she possessed , from her little house itself to her very best <unk> .
But Jo frowned upon the whole <unk> , and would have nothing to do with it at first .
&quot; Why in the world should you spend your money , worry your family , and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don &apos;t care a <unk> for you ?
I thought you had too much pride and sense to <unk> to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and rides in a _ <unk> ? _ , &quot; said Jo , who , being called from the tragical climax of her novel , was not in the best mood for social <unk> .
&quot; I _ don &apos;t _ <unk> , and I hate being <unk> as much as you do ! &quot;
returned Amy indignantly , for the two still <unk> when such questions arose .
&quot; The girls do care for me , and I for them , and there &apos;s a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them , in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense .
You don &apos;t care to make people like you , to go into good society , and <unk> your manners and tastes .
I do , and I mean to make the most of every chance that comes .
_ You _ can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air , and call it independence , if you like .
That &apos;s not my way . &quot;
When Amy <unk> her tongue and <unk> her mind she usually got the best of it , for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side , while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of <unk> to such an <unk> extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an argument .
Amy &apos;s <unk> of Jo &apos;s idea of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing , and the discussion took a more amiable turn .
Much against her will , Jo at length consented to sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy , and help her sister through what she regarded as &quot; a nonsensical business . &quot;
The <unk> were sent , nearly all accepted , and the following Monday was set apart for the grand event .
Hannah was out of humor because her week &apos;s work was <unk> , and <unk> that &quot; ef the <unk> &apos; and <unk> &apos; warn &apos;t done <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos; would go well <unk> . &quot;
This <unk> in the <unk> of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the whole <unk> ; but Amy &apos;s motto was &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and having made up her mind what to do , she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles .
To begin with , Hannah &apos;s cooking didn &apos;t turn out well : the chicken was <unk> , the tongue too salt , and the chocolate wouldn &apos;t <unk> properly .
Then the cake and ice cost more than Amy expected , so did the <unk> ; and various other expenses , which seemed trifling at the <unk> , <unk> up rather <unk> afterward .
Beth got cold and took to her bed , Meg had an unusual number of <unk> to keep her at home , and Jo was in such a <unk> state of mind that her <unk> , accidents , and mistakes were uncommonly <unk> , serious , and trying .
&quot; If it hadn &apos;t been for mother I never should have got through , &quot; as Amy declared afterward , and gratefully remembered when &quot; the best joke of the season &quot; was entirely forgotten by everybody else .
If it was not fair on Monday , the young ladies were to come on Tuesday , <unk> arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree .
On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more exasperating than a steady <unk> .
It <unk> a little , shone a little , blew a little , and didn &apos;t make up its mind till it was too late for any one else to make up theirs .
Amy was up at dawn , <unk> people out of their <unk> and through their <unk> , that the house might be got in order .
The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby ; but without stopping to sigh for what she had not , she skilfully made the best of what she had , arranging chairs over the worn places in the carpet , covering <unk> on the walls with pictures <unk> in ivy , and filling up empty corners with <unk> <unk> , which gave an artistic air to the room , as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about .
The lunch looked charmingly ; and as she surveyed it , she sincerely hoped it would taste well , and that the borrowed glass , china , and silver would get safely home again .
The carriages were promised , Meg and mother were all ready to do the <unk> , Beth was able to help Hannah behind the scenes , Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind , an aching head , and a very decided <unk> of everybody and everything would allow , and , as she <unk> dressed , Amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment , when , lunch safely over , she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights ; for the &quot; cherry-bounce &quot; and the broken bridge were her strong points .
Then came two hours of suspense , during which she <unk> from parlor to porch , while public opinion <unk> like the weathercock .
A smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve , for nobody came ; and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the feast , that nothing might be lost .
&quot; No doubt about the weather to-day ; they will certainly come , so we must fly round and be ready for them , &quot; said Amy , as the sun woke her next morning .
She spoke briskly , but in her secret soul she wished she had said nothing about Tuesday , for her interest , like her cake , was getting a little <unk> .
&quot; I can &apos;t get any <unk> , so you will have to do without salad to-day , &quot; said Mr. March , coming in half an hour later , with an expression of placid despair .
&quot; Use the chicken , then ; the <unk> won &apos;t matter in a salad , &quot; advised his wife .
&quot; Hannah left it on the <unk> a minute , and the kittens got at it .
I &apos;m very sorry , Amy , &quot; added Beth , who was still a <unk> of cats .
&quot; Then I _ must _ have a lobster , for tongue alone won &apos;t do , &quot; said Amy decidedly .
&quot; Shall I rush into town and demand one ? &quot;
asked Jo , with the <unk> of a martyr .
&quot; You &apos;d come bringing it home under your arm , without any paper , just to try me .
I &apos;ll go myself , &quot; answered Amy , whose temper was beginning to fail .
<unk> in a thick veil and armed with a <unk> <unk> , she departed , feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit , and fit her for the labors of the day .
After some delay , the object of her desire was <unk> , likewise a bottle of dressing , to prevent further loss of time at home , and off she drove again , well pleased with her own forethought .
As the omnibus contained only one other <unk> , a sleepy old lady , Amy <unk> her veil , and <unk> the <unk> of the way by trying to find out where all her money had gone to .
So busy was she with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a new-comer , who entered without stopping the <unk> , till a masculine voice said , &quot; <unk> , Miss March , &quot; and , looking up , she beheld one of Laurie &apos;s most elegant college friends .
<unk> hoping that he would get out before she did , Amy utterly <unk> the basket at her feet , and , <unk> herself that she had on her new travelling dress , returned the young man &apos;s greeting with her usual <unk> and spirit .
They got on excellently ; for Amy &apos;s chief care was soon set at rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first , and she was chatting away in a peculiarly <unk> strain , when the old lady got out .
In <unk> to the door , she upset the basket , <unk> , <unk> ! --the lobster , in all its vulgar size and brilliancy , was <unk> to the <unk> eyes of a Tudor .
&quot; By <unk> , she &apos;s forgotten her dinner ! &quot;
cried the unconscious youth , poking the scarlet <unk> into its place with his cane , and preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady .
&quot; Please don <unk> <unk> &apos;s mine , &quot; murmured Amy , with a face nearly as red as her fish .
&#91; Illustration : Please don &apos;t , it &apos;s mine &#93; &quot; Oh , really , I beg pardon ; it &apos;s an uncommonly fine one , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
said Tudor , with great presence of mind , and an air of sober interest that did credit to his breeding .
Amy recovered herself in a breath , set her basket boldly on the seat , and said , laughing , -- &quot; Don &apos;t you wish you were to have some of the salad he &apos;s to make , and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat it ? &quot;
Now that was tact , for two of the <unk> <unk> of the masculine mind were touched : the lobster was <unk> surrounded by a <unk> of pleasing <unk> , and curiosity about &quot; the charming young ladies &quot; diverted his mind from the comical mishap .
&quot; I suppose he &apos;ll laugh and joke over it with Laurie , but I sha &apos;n&apos;t see them ; that &apos;s a comfort , &quot; thought Amy , as Tudor bowed and departed .
She did not mention this meeting at home ( though she discovered that , thanks to the upset , her new dress was much damaged by the <unk> of dressing that <unk> down the skirt ) , but went through with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before ; and at twelve o &apos;clock all was ready again .
Feeling that the neighbors were interested in her <unk> , she wished to <unk> the memory of yesterday &apos;s failure by a grand success to-day ; so she ordered the &quot; cherry-bounce , &quot; and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the <unk> .
&quot; There &apos;s the <unk> , they &apos;re coming !
I &apos;ll go into the porch to meet them ; it looks hospitable , and I want the poor child to have a good time after all her trouble , &quot; said Mrs. March , <unk> the <unk> to the word .
But after one glance , she retired , with an indescribable expression , for , looking quite lost in the big carriage , sat Amy and one young lady .
&quot; <unk> , Beth , and help Hannah clear half the things off the table ; it will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl , &quot; cried Jo , hurrying away to the lower <unk> , too excited to stop even for a laugh .
In came Amy , quite calm , and delightfully cordial to the one guest who had kept her promise ; the rest of the family , being of a dramatic turn , played their parts equally well , and Miss <unk> found them a most <unk> set ; for it was impossible to entirely control the merriment which possessed them .
The <unk> lunch being gayly <unk> of , the <unk> and garden <unk> , and art <unk> with enthusiasm , Amy ordered a <unk> ( alas for the elegant cherry-bounce ! )
and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset , when &quot; the party went out . &quot;
As she came walking in , looking very tired , but as composed as ever , she observed that every <unk> of the unfortunate _ f ? te _ had disappeared , except a suspicious <unk> about the corners of Jo &apos;s mouth .
&quot; You &apos;ve had a lovely afternoon for your drive , dear , &quot; said her mother , as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come .
&quot; Miss <unk> is a very sweet girl , and seemed to enjoy herself , I thought , &quot; observed Beth , with unusual warmth .
&quot; Could you spare me some of your cake ?
I really need some , I have so much company , and I can &apos;t make such delicious stuff as yours , &quot; asked Meg soberly .
&quot; Take it all ; I &apos;m the only one here who likes sweet things , and it will mould before I can <unk> of it , &quot; answered Amy , thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this .
&quot; It &apos;s a pity Laurie isn &apos;t here to help us , &quot; began Jo , as they sat down to ice-cream and salad for the second time in two days .
A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks , and the whole family ate in heroic silence , till Mr. March <unk> observed , &quot; <unk> was one of the favorite dishes of the <unk> , and <unk> &quot; <unk> a general explosion of laughter cut short the &quot; history of <unk> , &quot; to the great surprise of the learned gentleman .
&quot; <unk> everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels : Germans like messes .
I &apos;m sick of the sight of this ; and there &apos;s no reason you should all die of a <unk> because I &apos;ve been a fool , &quot; cried Amy , <unk> her eyes .
&quot; I thought I _ should _ have died when I saw you two girls rattling about in the <unk> , like two little <unk> in a very big <unk> , and mother waiting in state to receive the throng , &quot; sighed Jo , quite spent with laughter .
&quot; I &apos;m very sorry you were disappointed , dear , but we all did our best to satisfy you , &quot; said Mrs. March , in a tone full of motherly regret .
&quot; I _ am _ satisfied ; I &apos;ve done what I undertook , and it &apos;s not my fault that it failed ; I comfort myself with that , &quot; said Amy , with a little quiver in her voice .
&quot; I thank you all very much for helping me , and I &apos;ll thank you still more if you won &apos;t <unk> to it for a month , at least . &quot;
No one did for several months ; but the word &quot; _ f ? te _ &quot; always produced a general smile , and Laurie &apos;s birthday gift to Amy was a tiny <unk> lobster in the shape of a charm for her <unk> .

<unk> <unk> .
<unk> suddenly smiled upon Jo , and dropped a <unk> penny in her path .
Not a golden penny , exactly , but I doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness than did the little sum that came to her in this wise .
Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room , put on her scribbling suit , and &quot; fall into a <unk> , &quot; as she expressed it , writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul , for till that was finished she could find no peace .
Her &quot; scribbling suit &quot; <unk> of a black <unk> pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will , and a cap of the same material , adorned with a cheerful red bow , into which she bundled her hair when the <unk> were cleared for <unk> .
This cap was a <unk> to the inquiring eyes of her family , who during these <unk> kept their distance , merely popping in their heads <unk> , to ask , with interest , &quot; Does genius burn , Jo ? &quot;
They did not always venture even to ask this question , but took an observation of the cap , and <unk> <unk> .
If this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead , it was a sign that hard work was going on ; in exciting moments it was pushed <unk> <unk> ; and when despair seized the author it was plucked <unk> off , and cast upon the floor .
At such times the <unk> silently <unk> ; and not until the red bow was seen gayly erect upon the gifted brow , did any one dare address Jo .
She did not think herself a genius by any means ; but when the writing fit came on , she gave herself up to it with entire <unk> , and led a blissful life , unconscious of want , care , or bad weather , while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world , full of friends almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh .
<unk> <unk> her eyes , meals stood <unk> , day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times , and made these hours worth living , even if they bore no other fruit .
The divine <unk> usually lasted a week or two , and then she emerged from her &quot; <unk> , &quot; hungry , sleepy , cross , or despondent .
She was just <unk> from one of these <unk> when she was prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture , and in return for her virtue was <unk> with a new idea .
It was a People &apos;s <unk> , the lecture on the <unk> , and Jo rather wondered at the <unk> of such a subject for such an audience , but took it for granted that some great social evil would be <unk> or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories of the <unk> to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of <unk> and <unk> , and whose lives were spent in trying to <unk> harder <unk> than that of the <unk> .
They were early ; and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her <unk> , Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who <unk> the seat with them .
On her left were two matrons , with massive <unk> , and bonnets to match , discussing <unk> &apos;s <unk> and making <unk> .
<unk> sat a pair of humble lovers , <unk> holding each other by the hand , a <unk> spinster eating <unk> out of a paper bag , and an old gentleman taking his <unk> nap behind a yellow <unk> .
On her right , her only neighbor was a <unk> lad absorbed in a newspaper .
It was a <unk> sheet , and Jo examined the work of art nearest her , <unk> wondering what <unk> <unk> of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume , tumbling over a <unk> with a <unk> at his throat , while two <unk> young gentlemen , with <unk> small feet and big eyes , were <unk> each other close by , and a dishevelled <unk> was flying away in the <unk> with her mouth wide open .
<unk> to turn a page , the lad saw her looking , and , with boyish <unk> , offered half his paper , saying <unk> , &quot; Want to read it ?
That &apos;s a <unk> story . &quot;
Jo accepted it with a smile , for she had never <unk> her liking for lads , and soon found herself <unk> in the usual <unk> of love , mystery , and <unk> , for the story belonged to that class of light literature in which the passions have a holiday , and when the author &apos;s invention fails , a grand <unk> <unk> the stage of one half the _ <unk> person ? _ , leaving the other half to exult over their <unk> .
&quot; <unk> , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
asked the boy , as her eye went down the last paragraph of her <unk> .
&quot; I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried , &quot; returned Jo , amused at his admiration of the trash .
&quot; I should think I was a pretty lucky <unk> if I could .
She makes a good living out of such stories , they say ; &quot; and he pointed to the name of Mrs. S. L. A. N. <unk> <unk> , under the title of the tale .
&quot; Do you know her ? &quot;
asked Jo , with sudden interest .
&quot; No ; but I read all her pieces , and I know a fellow who works in the office where this paper is printed . &quot;
&quot; Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this ? &quot;
and Jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and <unk> <unk> that adorned the page .
&quot; <unk> she does !
She knows just what folks like , and gets paid well for writing it . &quot;
Here the lecture began , but Jo heard very little of it , for while <unk> <unk> was <unk> away about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , she was <unk> taking down the address of the paper , and boldly resolving to try for the <unk> prize offered in its <unk> for a sensational story .
By the time the lecture ended and the audience <unk> , she had built up a splendid fortune for herself ( not the first <unk> upon paper ) , and was already deep in the <unk> of her story , being <unk> to decide whether the <unk> should come before the <unk> or after the <unk> .
She said nothing of her plan at home , but fell to work next day , much to the <unk> of her mother , who always looked a little anxious when &quot; genius took to burning . &quot;
Jo had never tried this style before , <unk> herself with very mild romances for the &quot; Spread Eagle . &quot;
Her <unk> experience and <unk> reading were of service now , for they gave her some idea of dramatic effect , and supplied plot , language , and costumes .
Her story was as full of <unk> and despair as her limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions <unk> her to make it , and , having located it in <unk> , she wound up with an earthquake , as a striking and appropriate _ d ? <unk> _ .
The manuscript was privately despatched , accompanied by a note , modestly saying that if the tale didn &apos;t get the prize , which the writer hardly dared expect , she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth .
Six weeks is a long time to wait , and a still longer time for a girl to keep a secret ; but Jo did both , and was just beginning to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again , when a letter arrived which almost took her breath away ; for on opening it , a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap .
For a minute she stared at it as if it had been a <unk> , then she read her letter and began to cry .
If the amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a <unk> , I think he would devote his leisure hours , if he has any , to that amusement ; for Jo valued the letter more than the money , because it was encouraging ; and after years of effort it was _ so _ pleasant to find that she had learned to do something , though it was only to write a sensation story .
&#91; Illustration : A check for one hundred dollars &#93; A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she , when , having composed herself , she electrified the family by <unk> before them with the letter in one hand , the check in the other , <unk> that she had won the prize .
Of course there was a great <unk> , and when the story came every one read and praised it ; though after her father had told her that the language was good , the romance fresh and hearty , and the tragedy quite thrilling , he shook his head , and said in his unworldly way , -- &quot; You can do better than this , Jo .
<unk> at the highest , and never mind the money . &quot;
&quot; _ I _ think the money is the best part of it .
What _ will _ you do with such a fortune ? &quot;
asked Amy , regarding the magic slip of paper with a <unk> eye .
&quot; Send Beth and mother to the <unk> for a month or two , &quot; answered Jo promptly .
&quot; Oh , how splendid !
No , I can &apos;t do it , dear , it would be so selfish , &quot; cried Beth , who had clapped her thin hands , and taken a long breath , as if pining for fresh <unk> ; then stopped herself , and <unk> away the check which her sister waved before her .
&quot; Ah , but you shall go , I &apos;ve set my heart on it ; that &apos;s what I tried for , and that &apos;s why I succeeded .
I never get on when I think of myself alone , so it will help me to work for you , don &apos;t you see ?
Besides , Marmee needs the change , and she won &apos;t leave you , so you _ must _ go .
Won &apos;t it be fun to see you come home plump and rosy again ?
Hurrah for Dr. Jo , who always <unk> her <unk> ! &quot;
To the sea side they went , after much discussion ; and though Beth didn &apos;t come home as plump and rosy as could be desired , she was much better , while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger ; so Jo was satisfied with the <unk> of her prize money , and fell to work with a cheery spirit , bent on <unk> more of those delightful <unk> .
She did earn several that year , and began to feel herself a power in the house ; for by the magic of a pen , her &quot; rubbish &quot; turned into comforts for them all .
&quot; The Duke &apos;s <unk> &quot; paid the butcher &apos;s bill , &quot; A <unk> <unk> &quot; put down a new carpet , and the &quot; <unk> of the <unk> &quot; proved the blessing of the Marches in the way of <unk> and gowns .
<unk> is certainly a most desirable thing , but poverty has its sunny side , and one of the sweet <unk> of <unk> is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand ; and to the inspiration of <unk> , we owe half the wise , beautiful , and useful blessings of the world .
Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction , and ceased to envy richer girls , taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants , and need ask no one for a penny .
Little notice was taken of her stories , but they found a market ; and , <unk> by this fact , she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and fortune .
Having copied her novel for the fourth time , read it to all her confidential friends , and <unk> it with fear and trembling to three <unk> , she at last disposed of it , on condition that she would cut it down one third , and <unk> all the parts which she particularly admired .
&quot; Now I must either bundle it back into my <unk> to mould , pay for <unk> it myself , or <unk> it up to suit <unk> , and get what I can for it .
<unk> is a very good thing to have in the house , but <unk> is more <unk> ; so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important subject , &quot; said Jo , calling a family <unk> .
&quot; Don &apos;t spoil your book , my girl , for there is more in it than you know , and the idea is well worked out .
Let it wait and ripen , &quot; was her father &apos;s advice ; and he practised as he preached , having waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen , and being in no haste to gather it , even now , when it was sweet and mellow .
&quot; It seems to me that Jo will <unk> more by making the trial than by waiting , &quot; said Mrs. March .
&quot; <unk> is the best test of such work , for it will show her both <unk> <unk> and faults , and help her to do better next time .
We are too <unk> ; but the praise and blame of <unk> will prove useful , even if she gets but little money . &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; said Jo , knitting her brows , &quot; that &apos;s just it ; I &apos;ve been fussing over the thing so long , I really don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s good , bad , or indifferent .
It will be a great help to have cool , <unk> persons take a look at it , and tell me what they think of it . &quot;
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t leave out a word of it ; you &apos;ll spoil it if you do , for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the <unk> of the people , and it will be all a muddle if you don &apos;t explain as you go on , &quot; said Meg , who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable novel ever written .
&quot; But Mr. <unk> says , &apos; Leave out the <unk> , make it brief and dramatic , and let the characters tell the story , &apos; &quot; interrupted Jo , turning to the <unk> &apos;s note .
&quot; Do as he tells you ; he knows what will sell , and we don &apos;t .
Make a good , popular book , and get as much money as you can .
By and by , when , you &apos;ve got a name , you can afford to <unk> , and have philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels , &quot; said Amy , who took a <unk> <unk> view of the subject .
&quot; Well , &quot; said Jo , laughing , &quot; if my people _ are _ &apos; philosophical and metaphysical , &apos; it isn &apos;t my fault , for I know nothing about such things , except what I hear father say , sometimes .
If I &apos;ve got some of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance , so much the better for me .
Now , Beth , what do you say ? &quot;
&quot; I should so like to see it printed _ soon _ , &quot; was all Beth said , and smiled in saying it ; but there was an unconscious <unk> on the last word , and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their <unk> <unk> , which <unk> Jo &apos;s heart , for a minute , with a <unk> fear , and decided her to make her little venture &quot; soon . &quot;
So , with <unk> <unk> , the young authoress laid her <unk> on her table , and <unk> it up as <unk> as any <unk> .
In the hope of pleasing every one , she took every one &apos;s advice ; and , like the old man and his <unk> in the fable , suited nobody .
Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got into it ; so that was allowed to remain , though she had her doubts about it .
Her mother thought that there _ was _ a trifle too much description ; out , therefore , it nearly all came , and with it many necessary links in the story .
Meg admired the tragedy ; so Jo piled up the <unk> to suit her , while Amy objected to the fun , and , with the best intentions in life , Jo quenched the sprightly scenes which relieved the <unk> character of the story .
Then , to complete the ruin , she cut it down one third , and confidingly sent the poor little romance , like a picked <unk> , out into the big , busy world , to try its fate .
Well , it was printed , and she got three hundred dollars for it ; likewise plenty of praise and blame , both so much greater than she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment , from which it took her some time to recover .
&quot; You said , mother , that <unk> would help me ; but how can it , when it &apos;s so <unk> that I don &apos;t know whether I &apos;ve written a promising book or broken all the ten <unk> ? &quot;
cried poor Jo , turning over a heap of <unk> , the <unk> of which filled her with pride and joy one minute , wrath and <unk> dismay the next .
&quot; This man says &apos; An <unk> book , full of truth , beauty , and earnestness ; all is sweet , <unk> , and healthy , &apos; &quot; continued the <unk> authoress .
&quot; The next , &apos; The theory of the book is bad , full of <unk> fancies , <unk> ideas , and <unk> characters . &apos;
Now , as I had no theory of any kind , don &apos;t believe in <unk> , and copied my characters from life , I don &apos;t see how this <unk> _ can _ be right .
Another says , &apos; It &apos;s one of the best American novels which has appeared for years &apos; ( I know better than that ) ; and the next <unk> that &apos; though it is original , and written with great force and feeling , it is a dangerous book . &apos;
<unk> &apos;t !
Some make fun of it , some <unk> , and nearly all <unk> that I had a deep theory to <unk> , when I only wrote it for the pleasure and the money .
I wish I &apos;d printed it whole or not at all , for I do hate to be so <unk> . &quot;
Her family and friends administered comfort and <unk> <unk> ; yet it was a hard time for <unk> , <unk> Jo , who meant so well , and had apparently done so ill .
But it did her good , for those whose opinion had real value gave her the <unk> which is an author &apos;s best education ; and when the first <unk> was over , she could laugh at her poor little book , yet believe in it still , and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the <unk> she had received .
&quot; Not being a genius , like <unk> , it won &apos;t kill me , &quot; she said stoutly ; &quot; and I &apos;ve got the joke on my side , after all ; for the parts that were taken straight out of real life are <unk> as impossible and absurd , and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced &apos; charmingly natural , tender , and true . &apos;
So I &apos;ll comfort myself with that ; and when I &apos;m ready , I &apos;ll up again and take another . &quot;

<unk> <unk> .
Like most other young matrons , Meg began her married life with the <unk> to be a model housekeeper .
John should find home a paradise ; he should always see a smiling face , should fare <unk> every day , and never know the loss of a button .
She brought so much love , energy , and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but succeed , in spite of some obstacles .
Her paradise was not a tranquil one ; for the little woman fussed , was <unk> to please , and <unk> about like a true <unk> , <unk> with many cares .
She was too tired , sometimes , even to smile ; John grew <unk> after a course of dainty dishes , and <unk> demanded plain fare .
As for buttons , she soon learned to wonder where they went , to shake her head over the <unk> of men , and to <unk> to make him sew them on himself , and then see if _ his _ work would stand impatient <unk> and clumsy fingers any better than hers .
They were very happy , even after they discovered that they couldn &apos;t live on love alone .
John did not find Meg &apos;s beauty <unk> , though she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee-pot ; nor did Meg miss any of the romance from the daily parting , when her husband followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry , &quot; Shall I send home <unk> or <unk> for dinner , darling ? &quot;
The little house ceased to be a glorified bower , but it became a home , and the young couple soon felt that it was a change for the better .
At first they played <unk> , and frolicked over it like children ; then John took steadily to business , feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders ; and Meg laid by her <unk> <unk> , put on a big apron , and fell to work , as before said , with more energy than discretion .
While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. <unk> &apos;s <unk> Book as if it were a <unk> exercise , working out the <unk> with patience and care .
Sometimes her family were invited in to help eat up a too <unk> feast of successes , or Lotty would be privately despatched with a <unk> of failures , which were to be concealed from all eyes in the <unk> <unk> of the little Hummels .
An evening with John over the <unk> usually produced a <unk> lull in the <unk> enthusiasm , and a <unk> fit would <unk> , during which the poor man was put through a course of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> coffee , which tried his soul , although he bore it with praiseworthy <unk> .
Before the golden mean was found , however , Meg added to her domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without , --a family jar .
<unk> with a housewifely wish to see her <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , she undertook to put up her own <unk> jelly .
John was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots , and an extra quantity of sugar , for their own <unk> were ripe , and were to be <unk> to at once .
As John firmly believed that &quot; my wife &quot; was equal to anything , and took a natural pride in her skill , he resolved that she should be gratified , and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use .
Home came four dozen delightful little pots , half a <unk> of sugar , and a small boy to pick the <unk> for her .
With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap , arms <unk> to the <unk> , and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib , the young <unk> fell to work , feeling no doubts about her success ; for hadn &apos;t she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times ?
The array of pots rather amazed her at first , but John was so fond of jelly , and the nice little <unk> would look so well on the top shelf , that Meg resolved to fill them all , and spent a long day picking , <unk> , <unk> , and fussing over her jelly .
She did her best ; she asked advice of Mrs. <unk> ; she <unk> her brain to remember what Hannah did that she had left <unk> ; she <unk> , <unk> , and restrained , but that dreadful stuff wouldn &apos;t &quot; _ <unk> _ . &quot;
She longed to run home , bib and all , and ask mother to lend a hand , but John and she had agreed that they would never <unk> any one with their private worries , experiments , or quarrels .
They had laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most <unk> one ; but they had held to their resolve , and whenever they could get on without help they did so , and no one <unk> , for Mrs. March had advised the plan .
So Meg <unk> alone with the refractory <unk> all that hot summer day , and at five o &apos;clock sat down in her topsy-turvy kitchen , wrung her <unk> hands , lifted up her voice and wept .
Now , in the first flush of the new life , she had often said , -- &quot; My husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he likes .
I shall always be prepared ; there shall be no flurry , no scolding , no <unk> , but a neat house , a cheerful wife , and a good dinner .
John , dear , never stop to ask my leave , invite whom you please , and be sure of a welcome from me . &quot;
How charming that was , to be sure !
John quite glowed with pride to hear her say it , and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior wife .
But , although they had had company from time to time , it never happened to be unexpected , and Meg had never had an opportunity to <unk> herself till now .
It always happens so in this <unk> of tears ; there is an <unk> about such things which we can only wonder at , <unk> , and bear as we best can .
If John had not forgotten all about the jelly , it really would have been <unk> in him to choose that day , of all the days in the year , to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly .
<unk> himself that a handsome <unk> had been ordered that morning , feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute , and <unk> in pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce , when his pretty wife came running out to meet him , he escorted his friend to his mansion , with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband .
It is a world of <unk> , as John discovered when he reached the Dove-cote .
The front door usually stood <unk> open ; now it was not only shut , but locked , and yesterday &apos;s mud still adorned the steps .
The <unk> were closed and curtained , no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the <unk> , in white , with a distracting little bow in her hair , or a bright-eyed <unk> , smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest .
Nothing of the sort , for not a soul appeared , but a <unk> boy asleep under the <unk> .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid something has happened .
<unk> into the garden , Scott , while I look up Mrs. Brooke , &quot; said John , alarmed at the silence and solitude .
<unk> the house he hurried , led by a <unk> smell of burnt sugar , and Mr. Scott strolled after him , with a queer look on his face .
He paused <unk> at a distance when Brooke disappeared ; but he could both see and hear , and , being a <unk> , enjoyed the prospect <unk> .
In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair ; one edition of jelly was <unk> from pot to pot , another lay upon the floor , and a third was burning gayly on the stove .
Lotty , with <unk> <unk> , was calmly eating bread and <unk> wine , for the jelly was still in a <unk> <unk> state , while Mrs. Brooke , with her apron over her head , sat sobbing dismally .
&quot; My dearest girl , what is the matter ? &quot;
cried John , rushing in , with awful visions of <unk> hands , sudden news of affliction , and secret <unk> at the thought of the guest in the garden .
&quot; O John , I _ am _ so tired and hot and cross and worried !
I &apos;ve been at it till I &apos;m all worn out .
Do come and help me or I _ shall _ die ! &quot;
and the exhausted <unk> cast herself upon his breast , giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word , for her pinafore had been <unk> at the same time as the floor .
&quot; What worries you , dear ?
Has anything dreadful happened ? &quot;
asked the anxious John , tenderly kissing the <unk> of the little cap , which was all <unk> .
&quot; Yes , &quot; sobbed Meg despairingly .
&quot; Tell me quick , then .
Don &apos;t cry , I can bear anything better than that .
Out with it , love . &quot;
&quot; <unk> jelly won &apos;t <unk> and I don &apos;t know what to do ! &quot;
John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward ; and the <unk> Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty <unk> , which put the finishing stroke to poor Meg &apos;s woe .
&quot; Is that all ?
<unk> it out of window , and don &apos;t bother any more about it .
I &apos;ll buy you quarts if you want it ; but for heaven &apos;s sake don &apos;t have <unk> , for I &apos;ve brought Jack Scott home to dinner , and-- &quot; John got no further , for Meg cast him off , and clasped her hands with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair , exclaiming in a tone of mingled indignation , reproach , and dismay , -- &quot; A man to dinner , and everything in a mess !
John Brooke , how _ could _ you do such a thing ? &quot;
&quot; Hush , he &apos;s in the garden !
I forgot the confounded jelly , but it can &apos;t be helped now , &quot; said John , surveying the prospect with an anxious eye .
&quot; You ought to have sent word , or told me this morning , and you ought to have remembered how busy I was , &quot; continued Meg petulantly ; for even turtle-doves will peck when ruffled .
&quot; I didn &apos;t know it this morning , and there was no time to send word , for I met him on the way out .
I never thought of asking leave , when you have always told me to do as I liked .
I never tried it before , and hang me if I ever do again ! &quot;
added John , with an <unk> air .
&quot; I should hope not !
Take him away at once ; I can &apos;t see him , and there isn &apos;t any dinner . &quot;
&quot; Well , I like that !
Where &apos;s the beef and <unk> I sent home , and the pudding you promised ? &quot;
cried John , rushing to the <unk> .
&quot; I hadn &apos;t time to cook anything ; I meant to <unk> at mother &apos;s .
I &apos;m sorry , but I was _ so _ busy ; &quot; and Meg &apos;s tears began again .
John was a mild man , but he was human ; and after a long day &apos;s work , to come home tired , hungry , and hopeful , to find a chaotic house , an empty table , and a cross wife was not exactly <unk> to repose of mind or manner .
He restrained himself , however , and the little <unk> would have blown over , but for one <unk> word .
&quot; It &apos;s a scrape , I <unk> ; but if you will lend a hand , we &apos;ll pull through , and have a good time yet .
Don &apos;t cry , dear , but just exert yourself a bit , and knock us up something to eat .
We &apos;re both as hungry as <unk> , so we sha &apos;n&apos;t mind what it is .
Give us the cold <unk> , and bread and <unk> ; we won &apos;t ask for jelly . &quot;
He meant it for a good-natured joke ; but that one word sealed his fate .
Meg thought it was _ too _ cruel to hint about her sad failure , and the last <unk> of patience vanished as he spoke .
&quot; You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can ; I &apos;m too used up to &apos; exert &apos; myself for any one .
It &apos;s like a man to propose a <unk> and vulgar bread and <unk> for company .
I won &apos;t have anything of the sort in my house .
Take that Scott up to mother &apos;s , and tell him I &apos;m away , sick , dead , <unk> .
I won &apos;t see him , and you two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like : you won &apos;t have anything else here ; &quot; and having delivered her <unk> all in one breath , Meg cast away her pinafore , and precipitately left the field to <unk> herself in her own room .
What those two creatures did in her absence , she never knew ; but Mr. Scott was not taken &quot; up to mother &apos;s , &quot; and when Meg <unk> , after they had strolled away together , she found <unk> of a <unk> lunch which filled her with <unk> .
Lotty <unk> that they had eaten &quot; a much , and greatly laughed , and the master bid her throw away all the sweet stuff , and hide the pots . &quot;
Meg longed to go and tell mother ; but a sense of shame at her own short-comings , of loyalty to John , &quot; who might be cruel , but nobody should know it , &quot; restrained her ; and after a <unk> <unk> up , she dressed herself prettily , and sat down to wait for John to come and be forgiven .
Unfortunately , John didn &apos;t come , not seeing the matter in that light .
He had carried it off as a good joke with Scott , <unk> his little wife as well as he could , and played the host so <unk> that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner , and promised to come again .
But John was angry , though he did not show it ; he felt that Meg had got him into a scrape , and then deserted him in his hour of need .
&quot; It wasn &apos;t fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time , with perfect freedom , and when he took you at your word , to <unk> up and blame him , and leave him in the <unk> , to be laughed at or pitied .
No , by George , it wasn &apos;t !
and Meg must know it . &quot;
He had <unk> <unk> during the feast , but when the flurry was over , and he strolled home , after seeing Scott off , a <unk> mood came over him .
&quot; Poor little thing !
it was hard upon her when she tried so heartily to please me .
She was wrong , of course , but then she was young .
I must be patient and teach her . &quot;
He hoped she had not gone <unk> hated gossip and <unk> .
For a minute he was ruffled again at the mere thought of it ; and then the fear that Meg would cry herself sick softened his heart , and sent him on at a <unk> pace , resolving to be calm and kind , but firm , quite firm , and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse .
Meg likewise resolved to be &quot; calm and kind , but firm , &quot; and show _ him _ his duty .
She longed to run to meet him , and beg pardon , and be kissed and comforted , as she was sure of being ; but , of course , she did nothing of the sort , and when she saw John coming , began to hum quite naturally , as she rocked and sewed , like a lady of leisure in her best parlor .
John was a little disappointed not to find a tender <unk> ; but , feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology , he made none , only came leisurely in , and laid himself upon the sofa , with the <unk> <unk> remark , -- &quot; We are going to have a new moon , my dear . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve no objection , &quot; was Meg &apos;s equally soothing remark .
A few other <unk> of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke , and <unk> by Mrs. Brooke , and conversation <unk> .
John went to one window , <unk> his paper , and wrapped himself in it , <unk> speaking .
Meg went to the other window , and sewed as if new <unk> for her slippers were among the <unk> of life .
Neither spoke ; both looked quite &quot; calm and firm , &quot; and both felt desperately uncomfortable .
&#91; Illustration : Both felt desperately uncomfortable &#93; &quot; Oh dear , &quot; thought Meg , &quot; married life is very trying , and does need infinite patience , as well as love , as mother says . &quot;
The word &quot; mother &quot; suggested other maternal <unk> , given long ago , and received with <unk> <unk> .
&quot; John is a good man , but he has his faults , and you must learn to see and bear with them , remembering your own .
He is very decided , but never will be <unk> , if you reason kindly , not <unk> impatiently .
He is very <unk> , and particular about the <unk> good <unk> , though you call him &apos; fussy . &apos;
Never deceive him by look or word , Meg , and he will give you the confidence you deserve , the support you need .
He has a temper , not like ours , --one flash , and then all over , --but the white , still anger , that is seldom stirred , but once kindled , is hard to <unk> .
Be careful , very careful , not to wake this anger against yourself , for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect .
<unk> yourself , be the first to ask pardon if you both <unk> , and guard against the little <unk> , <unk> , and hasty words that often <unk> the way for bitter sorrow and regret . &quot;
These words came back to Meg , as she sat sewing in the sunset , especially the last .
This was the first serious <unk> ; her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and <unk> , as she recalled them , her own anger looked childish now , and thoughts of poor John coming home to such a scene quite <unk> her heart .
She glanced at him with tears in her eyes , but he did not see them ; she put down her work and got up , thinking , &quot; I _ will _ be the first to say , &apos; Forgive me , &apos; &quot; but he did not seem to hear her ; she went very slowly across the room , for pride was hard to <unk> , and stood by him , but he did not turn his head .
For a minute she felt as if she really couldn &apos;t do it ; then came the thought , &quot; This is the beginning , I &apos;ll do my part , and have nothing to reproach myself with , &quot; and stooping down , she softly kissed her husband on the forehead .
Of course that settled it ; the penitent kiss was better than a world of words , and John had her on his knee in a minute , saying tenderly , -- &quot; It was too bad to laugh at the poor little <unk> .
Forgive me , dear , I never will again ! &quot;
But he did , oh bless you , yes , hundreds of times , and so did Meg , both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made ; for family peace was <unk> in that little family jar .
After this , Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation , and served him up a pleasant feast without a <unk> wife for the first course ; on which occasion she was so gay and gracious , and made everything go off so charmingly , that Mr. Scott told John he was a happy fellow , and shook his head over the hardships of <unk> all the way home .
In the autumn , new trials and experiences came to Meg .
Sallie Moffat <unk> her friendship , was always running out for a dish of gossip at the little house , or inviting &quot; that poor dear &quot; to come in and spend the day at the big house .
It was pleasant , for in dull weather Meg often felt lonely ; all were busy at home , John absent till night , and nothing to do but sew , or read , or <unk> about .
So it naturally fell out that Meg got into the way of <unk> and <unk> with her friend .
Seeing Sallie &apos;s pretty things made her long for such , and pity herself because she had not got them .
Sallie was very kind , and often offered her the coveted trifles ; but Meg declined them , knowing that John wouldn &apos;t like it ; and then this foolish little woman went and did what John disliked infinitely worse .
She knew her husband &apos;s <unk> , and she loved to feel that he trusted her , not only with his happiness , but what some men seem to value more , <unk> money .
She knew where it was , was free to take what she liked , and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny , pay bills once a month , and remember that she was a poor man &apos;s wife .
<unk> now , she had done well , been prudent and <unk> , kept her little <unk> neatly , and showed them to him <unk> without fear .
But that autumn the <unk> got into Meg &apos;s paradise , and tempted her , like many a <unk> Eve , not with apples , but with dress .
Meg didn &apos;t like to be pitied and made to feel poor ; it irritated her , but she was ashamed to confess it , and now and then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty , so that Sallie needn &apos;t think she had to <unk> .
She always felt wicked after it , for the pretty things were seldom <unk> ; but then they cost so little , it wasn &apos;t worth worrying about ; so the trifles increased unconsciously , and in the shopping <unk> she was no longer a <unk> <unk> .
But the trifles cost more than one would imagine ; and when she cast up her accounts at the end of the month , the sum <unk> rather <unk> her .
John was busy that month , and left the bills to her ; the next month he was absent ; but the third he had a grand <unk> settling up , and Meg never forgot it .
A few days before she had done a dreadful thing , and it weighed upon her conscience .
Sallie had been buying <unk> , and Meg longed for a new one , <unk> a handsome light one for parties , her black silk was so common , and thin things for evening wear were only proper for girls .
Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year ; that was only a month to wait , and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain , and she had the money , if she only dared to take it .
John always said what was his was hers ; but would he think it right to spend not only the <unk> five-and-twenty , but another five-and-twenty out of the household <unk> ?
That was the question .
Sallie had <unk> her to do it , had offered to <unk> the money , and with the best intentions in life , had tempted Meg beyond her strength .
In an evil moment the <unk> held up the lovely , <unk> folds , and said , &quot; A bargain , I assure you , ma &apos;am . &quot;
She answered , &quot; I &apos;ll take it ; &quot; and it was cut off and paid for , and Sallie had exulted , and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no <unk> , and driven away , feeling as if she had <unk> something , and the <unk> were after her .
&#91; Illustration : A bargain , I assure you , ma &apos;am &#93; When she got home , she tried to <unk> the <unk> of remorse by <unk> forth the lovely silk ; but it looked less silvery now , didn &apos;t become her , after all , and the words &quot; fifty dollars &quot; seemed <unk> like a pattern down each breadth .
She put it away ; but it haunted her , not delightfully , as a new dress should , but dreadfully , like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid .
When John got out his books that night , Meg &apos;s heart <unk> , and for the first time in her married life , she was afraid of her husband .
The kind , brown eyes looked as if they could be stern ; and though he was unusually merry , she fancied he had found her out , but didn &apos;t mean to let her know it .
The <unk> were all paid , the books all in order .
John had praised her , and was <unk> the old <unk> which they called the &quot; bank , &quot; when Meg , knowing that it was quite empty , stopped his hand , saying nervously , -- &quot; You haven &apos;t seen my private expense book yet . &quot;
John never asked to see it ; but she always insisted on his doing so , and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted , and made him guess what &quot; piping &quot; was , demand <unk> the meaning of a &quot; <unk> , &quot; or wonder how a little thing composed of three <unk> , a bit of velvet , and a pair of strings , could <unk> be a bonnet , and cost five or six dollars .
That night he looked as if he would like the fun of <unk> her figures and pretending to be horrified at her <unk> , as he often did , being particularly proud of his prudent wife .
The little book was brought slowly out , and laid down before him .
Meg got behind his chair under pretence of smoothing the <unk> out of his tired forehead , and standing there , she said , with her panic increasing with every word , -- &quot; John , dear , I &apos;m ashamed to show you my book , for I &apos;ve really been dreadfully <unk> lately .
I go about so much I must have things , you know , and Sallie advised my getting it , so I did ; and my New-Year &apos;s money will partly pay for it : but I was sorry after I &apos;d done it , for I knew you &apos;d think it wrong in me . &quot;
John laughed , and drew her round beside him , saying <unk> , &quot; Don &apos;t go and hide .
I won &apos;t beat you if you _ have _ got a pair of <unk> boots ; I &apos;m rather proud of my wife &apos;s feet , and don &apos;t mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots , if they are good ones . &quot;
That had been one of her last &quot; trifles , &quot; and John &apos;s eye had fallen on it as he spoke .
&quot; Oh , what _ will _ he say when he comes to that awful fifty dollars ! &quot;
thought Meg , with a shiver .
&quot; It &apos;s worse than boots , it &apos;s a silk dress , &quot; she said , with the <unk> of <unk> , for she wanted the worst over .
&quot; Well , dear , what is the &apos; <unk> &apos;d <unk> , &apos; as Mr. <unk> says ? &quot;
That didn &apos;t sound like John , and she knew he was looking up at her with the <unk> look that she had always been ready to meet and answer with one as frank till now .
She turned the page and her head at the same time , pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough without the fifty , but which was <unk> to her with that added .
For a minute the room was very still ; then John said slowly , --but she could feel it cost him an effort to express no <unk> , -- &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know that fifty is much for a dress , with all the furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days . &quot;
&quot; It isn &apos;t made or trimmed , &quot; sighed Meg <unk> , for a sudden recollection of the cost still to be <unk> quite <unk> her .
&quot; <unk> <unk> of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman , but I &apos;ve no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat &apos;s when she gets it on , &quot; said John <unk> .
&quot; I know you are angry , John , but I can &apos;t help it .
I don &apos;t mean to waste your money , and I didn &apos;t think those little things would count up so .
I can &apos;t resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants , and <unk> me because I don &apos;t .
I try to be contented , but it is hard , and I &apos;m tired of being poor . &quot;
The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them , but he did , and they wounded him deeply , for he had <unk> himself many pleasures for Meg &apos;s sake .
She could have <unk> her tongue out the minute she had said it , for John pushed the books away , and got up , saying , with a little quiver in his voice , &quot; I was afraid of this ; I do my best , Meg . &quot;
If he had scolded her , or even shaken her , it would not have broken her heart like those few words .
She ran to him and held him close , crying , with <unk> tears , &quot; O John , my dear , kind , <unk> boy , I didn &apos;t mean it !
It was so wicked , so <unk> and ungrateful , how could I say it !
Oh , how could I say it ! &quot;
He was very kind , forgave her <unk> , and did not utter one reproach ; but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be forgotten soon , although he might never <unk> to it again .
She had promised to love him for better for worse ; and then she , his wife , had <unk> him with his poverty , after spending his earnings <unk> .
It was dreadful ; and the worst of it was John went on so quietly afterward , just as if nothing had happened , except that he stayed in town later , and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep .
A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick ; and the discovery that John had <unk> the order for his new great-coat <unk> her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold .
He had simply said , in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change , &quot; I can &apos;t afford it , my dear . &quot;
Meg said no more , but a few minutes after he found her in the hall , with her face buried in the old great-coat , crying as if her heart would break .
They had a long talk that night , and Meg learned to love her husband better for his poverty , because it seemed to have made a man of him , given him the strength and courage to fight his own way , and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural <unk> and failures of those he loved .
Next day she put her pride in her pocket , went to Sallie , told the truth , and asked her to buy the silk as a favor .
The good-natured Mrs. Moffat <unk> did so , and had the <unk> not to make her a present of it immediately afterward .
Then Meg ordered home the great-coat , and , when John arrived , she put it on , and asked him how he liked her new silk gown .
One can imagine what answer he made , how he received his present , and what a blissful state of things <unk> .
John came home early , Meg <unk> no more ; and that great-coat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband , and taken off at night by a most devoted little wife .
So the year rolled round , and at midsummer there came to Meg a new experience , --the deepest and tenderest of a woman &apos;s life .
Laurie came <unk> into the kitchen of the Dove-cote , one Saturday , with an excited face , and was received with the <unk> of <unk> ; for Hannah clapped her hands with a <unk> in one and the cover in the other .
&quot; How &apos;s the little mamma ?
Where is everybody ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell me before I came home ? &quot;
began Laurie , in a loud whisper .
&quot; Happy as a queen , the dear !
Every soul of &apos; em is upstairs a <unk> &apos; ; we didn &apos;t want no <unk> round .
Now you go into the parlor , and I &apos;ll send &apos; em down to you , &quot; with which somewhat <unk> reply Hannah vanished , <unk> <unk> .
Presently Jo appeared , proudly bearing a <unk> bundle laid forth upon a large pillow .
Jo &apos;s face was very sober , but her eyes twinkled , and there was an odd sound in her voice of <unk> emotion of some sort .
&quot; Shut your eyes and hold out your arms , &quot; she said invitingly .
Laurie <unk> precipitately into a corner , and put his hands behind him with an imploring gesture : &quot; No , thank you , I &apos;d rather not .
I shall drop it or <unk> it , as sure as fate . &quot;
&quot; Then you sha &apos;n&apos;t see your nevvy , &quot; said Jo decidedly , turning as if to go .
&quot; I will , I will !
only you must be <unk> for damages ; &quot; and , <unk> orders , Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms .
A <unk> of laughter from Jo , Amy , Mrs. March , Hannah , and John caused him to open them the next minute , to find himself <unk> with two babies instead of one .
&#91; Illustration : Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms &#93; No wonder they laughed , for the expression of his face was droll enough to <unk> a <unk> , as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious <unk> to the <unk> spectators , with such dismay that Jo sat down on the floor and screamed .
&quot; <unk> , by Jupiter ! &quot;
was all he said for a minute ; then , turning to the women with an appealing look that was <unk> <unk> , he added , &quot; Take &apos; em quick , somebody !
I &apos;m going to laugh , and I shall drop &apos; em . &quot;
John rescued his babies , and marched up and down , with one on each arm , as if already <unk> into the <unk> of <unk> , while Laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks .
&quot; It &apos;s the best joke of the season , isn &apos;t it ?
I wouldn &apos;t have you told , for I set my heart on <unk> you , and I flatter myself I &apos;ve done it , &quot; said Jo , when she got her breath .
&quot; I never was more <unk> in my life .
Isn &apos;t it fun ?
Are they boys ?
What are you going to name them ?
Let &apos;s have another look .
Hold me up , Jo ; for upon my life it &apos;s one too many for me , &quot; returned Laurie , regarding the infants with the air of a big , <unk> <unk> looking at a pair of <unk> kittens .
&quot; <unk> and girl .
Aren &apos;t they <unk> ? &quot;
said the proud papa , beaming upon the little , red <unk> as if they were <unk> angels .
&quot; Most remarkable children I ever saw .
Which is which ? &quot;
and Laurie bent like a <unk> to examine the <unk> .
&quot; Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl , French fashion , so you can always tell .
Besides , one has blue eyes and one brown .
Kiss them , Uncle Teddy , &quot; said wicked Jo .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid they <unk> &apos;t like it , &quot; began Laurie , with unusual <unk> in such matters .
&quot; Of course they will ; they are used to it now .
Do it this minute , sir ! &quot;
commanded Jo , fearing he might propose a <unk> .
Laurie <unk> up his face , and obeyed with a <unk> peck at each little cheek that produced another laugh , and made the babies <unk> .
&quot; There , I knew they didn &apos;t like it !
That &apos;s the boy ; see him <unk> ; he <unk> out with his <unk> like a good one .
Now then , young Brooke , <unk> into a man of your own size , will you ? &quot;
cried Laurie , delighted with a <unk> in the face from a tiny fist , flapping <unk> about .
&quot; He &apos;s to be named John Laurence , and the girl Margaret , after mother and grandmother .
We shall call her Daisy , so as not to have two <unk> , and I suppose the <unk> will be Jack , unless we find a better name , &quot; said Amy , with <unk> interest .
&quot; <unk> him <unk> , and call him &apos; Demi &apos; for short , &quot; said Laurie .
&quot; Daisy and Demi , <unk> the thing !
I _ knew _ Teddy would do it , &quot; cried Jo , <unk> her hands .
Teddy certainly had done it that time , for the babies were &quot; Daisy &quot; and &quot; Demi &quot; to the end of the chapter .
<unk> .
<unk> .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> &#93; &quot; Come , Jo , it &apos;s time . &quot;
&quot; For what ? &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me to-day ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve done a good many rash and foolish things in my life , but I don &apos;t think I ever was mad enough to say I &apos;d make six calls in one day , when a single one <unk> me for a week . &quot;
&quot; Yes , you did ; it was a bargain between us .
I was to finish the <unk> of Beth for you , and you were to go properly with me , and return our neighbors &apos; visits . &quot;
&quot; If it was <unk> was in the <unk> ; and I stand to the letter of my <unk> , <unk> .
There is a pile of clouds in the east ; it &apos;s _ not _ fair , and I don &apos;t go . &quot;
&quot; Now , that &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s a lovely day , no prospect of rain , and you pride yourself on keeping promises ; so be honorable ; come and do your duty , and then be at peace for another six months . &quot;
At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in <unk> ; for she was <unk> general to the family , and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen .
It was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first <unk> , and ordered out to make calls in her best array , on a warm <unk> day .
She hated calls of the formal sort , and never made any till Amy <unk> her with a bargain , bribe , or promise .
In the present <unk> , there was no escape ; and having clashed her <unk> rebelliously , while <unk> that she <unk> <unk> , she gave in , put away her work , and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation , told Amy the victim was ready .
&quot; Jo March , you are perverse enough to <unk> a saint !
You don &apos;t intend to make calls in that state , I hope , &quot; cried Amy , surveying her with amazement .
&quot; Why not ?
I &apos;m neat and cool and comfortable ; quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day .
If people care more for my clothes than they do for me , I don &apos;t wish to see them .
You can dress for both , and be as elegant as you please : it <unk> for you to be fine ; it doesn &apos;t for me , and furbelows only worry me . &quot;
&quot; Oh dear ! &quot;
sighed Amy ; &quot; now she &apos;s in a contrary fit , and will drive me distracted before I can get her properly ready .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s no pleasure to me to go to-day , but it &apos;s a debt we owe society , and there &apos;s no one to pay it but you and me .
I &apos;ll do anything for you , Jo , if you &apos;ll only dress yourself nicely , and come and help me do the civil .
You can talk so well , look so aristocratic in your best things , and behave so beautifully , if you try , that I &apos;m proud of you .
I &apos;m afraid to go alone ; do come and take care of me . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re an artful little <unk> to flatter and <unk> your cross old sister in that way .
The idea of my being aristocratic and well-bred , and your being afraid to go anywhere alone !
I don &apos;t know which is the most absurd .
Well , I &apos;ll go if I must , and do my best .
You shall be <unk> of the <unk> , and I &apos;ll obey blindly ; will that satisfy you ? &quot;
said Jo , with a sudden change from perversity to <unk> <unk> .
&quot; You &apos;re a perfect cherub !
Now put on all your best things , and I &apos;ll tell you how to behave at each place , so that you will make a good impression .
I want people to like you , and they would if you &apos;d only try to be a little more agreeable .
Do your hair the pretty way , and put the pink rose in your bonnet ; it &apos;s becoming , and you look too sober in your plain suit .
Take your light gloves and the <unk> handkerchief .
We &apos;ll stop at Meg &apos;s , and borrow her white <unk> , and then you can have my dove-colored one . &quot;
While Amy dressed , she issued her orders , and Jo obeyed them ; not without <unk> her <unk> , however , for she sighed as she rustled into her new <unk> , frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet strings in an <unk> bow , <unk> <unk> with pins as she put on her collar , wrinkled up her <unk> <unk> as she shook out the handkerchief , whose <unk> was as <unk> to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings ; and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a <unk> , as the last touch of elegance , she turned to Amy with an <unk> expression of countenance , saying meekly , -- &quot; I &apos;m perfectly miserable ; but if you consider me <unk> , I die happy . &quot;
&quot; You are highly satisfactory ; turn slowly round , and let me get a careful view . &quot;
Jo <unk> , and Amy gave a touch here and there , then fell back , with her head on one side , observing graciously , &quot; Yes , you &apos;ll do ; your head is all I could ask , for that white bonnet _ with _ the rose is quite <unk> .
Hold back your shoulders , and carry your hands easily , no matter if your gloves do pinch .
There &apos;s one thing you can do well , Jo , that is , wear a <unk> can &apos;t ; but it &apos;s very nice to see you , and I &apos;m so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one ; it &apos;s simple , but handsome , and those folds over the arm are really artistic .
Is the point of my <unk> in the middle , and have I <unk> my dress <unk> ?
I like to show my boots , for my feet _ are _ pretty , though my nose isn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever , &quot; said Jo , looking through her hand with the air of a <unk> at the blue feather against the gold hair .
&quot; Am I to drag my best dress through the dust , or <unk> it up , please , ma &apos;am ? &quot;
&quot; Hold it up when you walk , but drop it in the house ; the sweeping style suits you best , and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully .
You haven &apos;t half <unk> one <unk> ; do it at once .
You &apos;ll never look finished if you are not careful about the little <unk> , for they make up the pleasing whole . &quot;
Jo sighed , and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove , in doing up her <unk> ; but at last both were ready , and sailed away , looking as &quot; pretty as <unk> , &quot; Hannah said , as she hung out of the upper window to watch them .
&quot; Now , Jo dear , the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people , so I want you to put on your best deportment .
Don &apos;t make any of your <unk> remarks , or do anything odd , will you ?
Just be calm , cool , and quiet , --that &apos;s safe and ladylike ; and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes , &quot; said Amy , as they approached the first place , having borrowed the white parasol and been <unk> by Meg , with a baby on each arm .
&quot; Let me see .
<unk> , cool , and quiet , &apos; <unk> , I think I can promise that .
I &apos;ve played the part of a prim young lady on the stage , and I &apos;ll try it off .
My powers are great , as you shall see ; so be easy in your mind , my child . &quot;
Amy looked relieved , but naughty Jo took her at her word ; for , during the first call , she sat with every <unk> gracefully composed , every fold <unk> draped , calm as a summer sea , cool as a <unk> , and as silent as a <unk> .
In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her &quot; charming novel , &quot; and the <unk> Chester introduced parties , <unk> , the opera , and the fashions ; each and all were answered by a smile , a bow , and a <unk> &quot; Yes &quot; or &quot; No , &quot; with the <unk> on .
In vain Amy telegraphed the word &quot; Talk , &quot; tried to draw her out , and administered <unk> <unk> with her foot .
Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all , with deportment like <unk> &apos;s face , &quot; <unk> regular , splendidly <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What a haughty , uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is ! &quot;
was the unfortunately <unk> remark of one of the ladies , as the door closed upon their guests .
Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall , but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her <unk> , and very naturally laid the blame upon Jo .
&quot; How could you mistake me so ?
I merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed , and you made yourself a perfect stock and stone .
Try to be sociable at the Lambs &apos; , gossip as other girls do , and be interested in dress and <unk> and whatever nonsense comes up .
They move in the best society , are valuable persons for us to know , and I wouldn &apos;t fail to make a good impression there for anything . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll be agreeable ; I &apos;ll gossip and <unk> , and have <unk> and <unk> over any trifle you like .
I rather enjoy this , and now I &apos;ll imitate what is called &apos; a charming girl ; &apos; I can do it , for I have May Chester as a model , and I &apos;ll improve upon her .
See if the Lambs don &apos;t say , &apos; What a lively , nice creature that Jo March is ! &apos; &quot;
Amy felt anxious , as well she might , for when Jo turned <unk> there was no knowing where she would stop .
Amy &apos;s face was a study when she saw her sister <unk> into the next drawing-room , kiss all the young ladies with <unk> , beam graciously upon the young gentlemen , and join in the <unk> with a spirit which amazed the <unk> .
Amy was taken possession of by Mrs. Lamb , with whom she was a favorite , and forced to hear a long account of <unk> &apos;s last attack , while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near , waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her .
So <unk> , she was <unk> to check Jo , who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief , and talked away as <unk> as the old lady .
A <unk> of heads gathered about her , and Amy <unk> her ears to hear what was going on ; for broken <unk> filled her with alarm , round eyes and uplifted hands <unk> her with curiosity , and frequent <unk> of laughter made her wild to share the fun .
One may imagine her suffering on <unk> fragments of this sort of conversation : -- &quot; She rides splendidly , <unk> taught her ? &quot;
&quot; No one ; she used to practise <unk> , holding the reins , and sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree .
Now she rides anything , for she doesn &apos;t know what fear is , and the <unk> lets her have horses cheap , because she <unk> them to carry ladies so well .
She has such a passion for it , I often tell her if everything else fails she can be a <unk> , and get her living so . &quot;
At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty , for the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady , which was her especial aversion .
But what could she do ?
for the old lady was in the middle of her story , and long before it was done Jo was off again , making more droll <unk> , and <unk> still more fearful <unk> .
&quot; Yes , Amy was in despair that day , for all the good <unk> were gone , and of three left , one was lame , one blind , and the other so <unk> that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start .
Nice <unk> for a pleasure party , wasn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; Which did she choose ? &quot;
asked one of the laughing gentlemen , who enjoyed the subject .
&quot; None of them ; she heard of a young horse at the <unk> over the river , and , though a lady had never <unk> him , she resolved to try , because he was handsome and <unk> .
Her struggles were really pathetic ; there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle , so she took the saddle to the horse .
My dear creature , she actually rowed it over the river , put it on her head , and marched up to the <unk> to the utter amazement of the old man ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : She took the saddle to the horse &#93; &quot; Did she ride the horse ? &quot;
&quot; Of course she did , and had a capital time .
I expected to see her brought home in fragments , but she managed him perfectly , and was the life of the party . &quot;
&quot; Well , I call that <unk> ! &quot;
and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving glance upon Amy , wondering what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable .
She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after , when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress .
One of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty <unk> hat she wore to the picnic ; and stupid Jo , instead of <unk> the place where it was bought two years ago , must needs answer , with unnecessary frankness , &quot; Oh , Amy painted it ; you can &apos;t buy those soft <unk> , so we paint ours any color we like .
It &apos;s a great comfort to have an artistic sister . &quot;
&quot; Isn &apos;t that an original idea ? &quot;
cried Miss Lamb , who found Jo great fun .
&quot; That &apos;s nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances .
There &apos;s nothing the child can &apos;t do .
Why , she wanted a pair of blue boots for Sallie &apos;s party , so she just painted her <unk> white ones the <unk> shade of sky-blue you ever saw , and they looked exactly like satin , &quot; added Jo , with an air of pride in her sister &apos;s accomplishments that <unk> Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her <unk> at her .
&quot; We read a story of yours the other day , and enjoyed it very much , &quot; observed the elder Miss Lamb , wishing to compliment the literary lady , who did not look the character just then , it must be confessed .
Any mention of her &quot; works &quot; always had a bad effect upon Jo , who either grew <unk> and looked offended , or changed the subject with a _ <unk> _ remark , as now .
&quot; <unk> you could find nothing better to read .
I write that rubbish because it <unk> , and ordinary people like it .
Are you going to New York this winter ? &quot;
As Miss Lamb had &quot; enjoyed &quot; the story , this speech was not exactly grateful or <unk> .
The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake ; but , fearing to make the matter worse , suddenly remembered that it was for her to make the first move toward departure , and did so with an <unk> that left three people with half-finished <unk> in their mouths .
&quot; Amy , we _ must _ go .
_ Good _ <unk> , dear ; _ do _ come and see us ; we are _ pining _ for a visit .
I don &apos;t dare to ask _ you _ , Mr. Lamb ; but if you _ should _ come , I don &apos;t think I shall have the heart to send you away . &quot;
Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester &apos;s <unk> style that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible , feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time .
&quot; Didn &apos;t I do that well ? &quot;
asked Jo , with a satisfied air , as they walked away .
&quot; Nothing could have been worse , &quot; was Amy &apos;s <unk> reply .
&quot; What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle , and the hats and boots , and all the rest of it ? &quot;
&quot; Why , it &apos;s funny , and <unk> people .
They know we are poor , so it &apos;s no use pretending that we have grooms , buy three or four hats a season , and have things as easy and fine as they do . &quot;
&quot; You needn &apos;t go and tell them all our little <unk> , and <unk> our poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way .
You haven &apos;t a bit of proper pride , and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak , &quot; said Amy despairingly .
Poor Jo looked abashed , and silently <unk> the end of her nose with the stiff handkerchief , as if performing a <unk> for her <unk> .
&quot; How shall I behave here ? &quot;
she asked , as they approached the third mansion .
&quot; Just as you please ; I wash my hands of you , &quot; was Amy &apos;s short answer .
&quot; Then I &apos;ll enjoy myself .
The boys are at home , and we &apos;ll have a comfortable time .
<unk> knows I need a little change , for elegance has a bad effect upon my <unk> , &quot; returned Jo gruffly , being disturbed by her failures to suit .
An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children <unk> soothed her ruffled feelings ; and , leaving Amy to entertain the <unk> and Mr. Tudor , who happened to be calling likewise , Jo devoted herself to the young folks , and found the change refreshing .
She listened to college stories with deep interest , caressed <unk> and <unk> without a murmur , agreed heartily that &quot; <unk> Brown was a <unk> , &quot; regardless of the improper form of praise ; and when one lad proposed a visit to his <unk> , she went with an <unk> which caused mamma to smile upon her , as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a <unk> condition by <unk> <unk> , <unk> but affectionate , and dearer to her than the most <unk> _ <unk> _ from the hands of an inspired Frenchwoman .
Leaving her sister to her own devices , Amy proceeded to enjoy herself to her heart &apos;s content .
Mr. Tudor &apos;s uncle had married an English lady who was third cousin to a living lord , and Amy regarded the whole family with great respect ; for , in spite of her American <unk> and breeding , she possessed that reverence for titles which <unk> the best of us , --that <unk> loyalty to the early faith in <unk> which set the most <unk> nation under the sun in a <unk> at the coming of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , some years ago , and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old , like that of a big son for an <unk> little mother , who held him while she could , and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled .
But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant <unk> of the British nobility did not render Amy <unk> of time ; and when the proper number of minutes had passed , she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society , and looked about for Jo , <unk> hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of March .
&#91; Illustration : It might have been worse &#93; It might have been worse , but Amy considered it bad ; for Jo sat on the grass , with an <unk> of boys about her , and a <unk> dog <unk> on the skirt of her state and festival dress , as she <unk> one of Laurie &apos;s pranks to her admiring audience .
One small child was poking <unk> with Amy &apos;s cherished parasol , a second was eating gingerbread over Jo &apos;s best bonnet , and a third playing ball with her gloves .
But all were enjoying themselves ; and when Jo collected her damaged property to go , her escort accompanied her , begging her to come again , &quot; it was such fun to hear about Laurie &apos;s larks . &quot;
&quot; <unk> boys , aren &apos;t they ?
I feel quite young and brisk again after that , &quot; said Jo , <unk> along with her hands behind her , partly from <unk> , partly to conceal the <unk> parasol .
&quot; Why do you always avoid Mr.
Tudor ? &quot;
asked Amy , wisely <unk> from any <unk> upon Jo &apos;s dilapidated appearance .
&quot; Don &apos;t like him ; he <unk> on airs , <unk> his sisters , worries his father , and doesn &apos;t speak respectfully of his mother .
Laurie says he is fast , and _ I _ don &apos;t consider him a desirable acquaintance ; so I let him alone . &quot;
&quot; You might treat him <unk> , at least .
You gave him a cool nod ; and just now you bowed and smiled in the <unk> way to Tommy <unk> , whose father keeps a <unk> store .
If you had just <unk> the nod and the bow , it would have been right , &quot; said Amy reprovingly .
&quot; No , it wouldn &apos;t , &quot; returned perverse Jo ; &quot; I neither like , respect , nor admire Tudor , though his grandfather &apos;s uncle &apos;s nephew &apos;s <unk> _ was _ third cousin to a lord .
Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever ; I think well of him , and like to show that I do , for he _ is _ a gentleman in spite of the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s no use trying to <unk> with you , &quot; began Amy .
&quot; Not the least , my dear , &quot; interrupted Jo ; &quot; so let us look amiable , and drop a card here , as the Kings are evidently out , for which I &apos;m deeply grateful . &quot;
The family <unk> having done its duty , the girls walked on , and Jo uttered another <unk> on reaching the <unk> house , and being told that the young ladies were engaged .
&quot; Now let us go home , and never mind Aunt March to-day .
We can run down there any time , and it &apos;s really a pity to trail through the dust in our best <unk> and <unk> , when we are tired and cross . &quot;
&quot; <unk> for yourself , if you please .
Aunt likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style , and making a formal call ; it &apos;s a little thing to do , but it gives her pleasure , and I don &apos;t believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and <unk> boys spoil them .
<unk> down , and let me take the <unk> off of your bonnet . &quot;
&quot; What a good girl you are , Amy ! &quot;
said Jo , with a <unk> glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister , which was fresh and <unk> still .
&quot; I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to please people as it is for you .
I think of them , but it takes too much time to do them ; so I wait for a chance to <unk> a great favor , and let the small ones slip ; but they tell best in the end , I fancy . &quot;
Amy smiled , and was <unk> at once , saying with a maternal air , -- &quot; Women should learn to be agreeable , particularly poor ones ; for they have no other way of <unk> the <unk> they receive .
If you &apos;d remember that , and practise it , you &apos;d be better liked than I am , because there is more of you . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a crotchety old thing , and always shall be , but I &apos;m willing to own that you are right ; only it &apos;s easier for me to <unk> my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when I don &apos;t feel like it .
It &apos;s a great <unk> to have such strong likes and <unk> , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a greater not to be able to hide them .
I don &apos;t mind saying that I don &apos;t approve of Tudor any more than you do ; but I &apos;m not called upon to tell him so ; neither are you , and there is no use in making yourself disagreeable because he is . &quot;
&quot; But I think girls ought to show when they <unk> of young men ; and how can they do it except by their manners ?
<unk> does not do any good , as I know to my sorrow , since I &apos;ve had Teddy to manage ; but there are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word , and I say we _ ought _ to do it to others if we can . &quot;
&quot; Teddy is a remarkable boy , and can &apos;t be taken as a <unk> of other boys , &quot; said Amy , in a tone of solemn conviction , which would have convulsed the &quot; remarkable boy , &quot; if he had heard it .
&quot; If we were <unk> , or women of wealth and position , we might do something , perhaps ; but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don &apos;t approve of them , and smile upon another set because we do , wouldn &apos;t have a particle of effect , and we should only be considered odd and <unk> . &quot;
&quot; So we are to countenance things and people which we <unk> , merely because we are not <unk> and <unk> , are we ?
That &apos;s a nice sort of <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t <unk> about it , I only know that it &apos;s the way of the world ; and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their <unk> .
I don &apos;t like <unk> , and I hope you will never try to be one . &quot;
&quot; I do like them , and I shall be one if I can ; for in spite of the laughing , the world would never get on without them .
We can &apos;t agree about that , for you belong to the old set , and I to the new : you will get on the best , but I shall have the <unk> time of it .
I should rather enjoy the <unk> and <unk> , I think . &quot;
&quot; Well , compose yourself now , and don &apos;t worry aunt with your new ideas . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll try not to , but I &apos;m always possessed to burst out with some particularly blunt speech or <unk> sentiment before her ; it &apos;s my doom , and I can &apos;t help it . &quot;
They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady , both absorbed in some very interesting subject ; but they dropped it as the girls came in , with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their <unk> .
Jo was not in a good humor , and the perverse fit returned ; but Amy , who had <unk> done her duty , kept her temper , and pleased everybody , was in a most angelic frame of mind .
This amiable spirit was felt at once , and both the aunts &quot; my <unk> &quot; her <unk> , looking what they afterwards said <unk> , -- &quot; That child <unk> every day . &quot;
&quot; Are you going to help about the fair , dear ? &quot;
asked Mrs. Carrol , as Amy sat down beside her with the confiding air <unk> people like so well in the young .
&quot; Yes , aunt .
Mrs. Chester asked me if I would , and I offered to <unk> a table , as I have nothing but my time to give . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not , &quot; put in Jo decidedly .
&quot; I hate to be <unk> , and the Chesters think it &apos;s a great favor to allow us to help with their highly <unk> fair .
I wonder you consented , Amy : they only want you to work . &quot;
&quot; I am willing to work : it &apos;s for the <unk> as well as the Chesters , and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun .
<unk> does not trouble me when it is well meant . &quot;
&quot; Quite right and proper .
I like your grateful spirit , my dear ; it &apos;s a pleasure to help people who <unk> our efforts : some do not , and that is trying , &quot; observed Aunt March , looking over her spectacles at Jo , who sat apart , rocking herself , with a somewhat <unk> expression .
&#91; Illustration : The call at Aunt March &apos;s &#93; If Jo had only known what a great happiness was <unk> in the <unk> for one of them , she would have turned <unk> in a minute ; but , unfortunately , we don &apos;t have windows in our <unk> , and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends ; better for us that we cannot as a general thing , but now and then it would be such a comfort , such a saving of time and temper .
By her next speech , Jo <unk> herself of several years of pleasure , and received a <unk> lesson in the art of holding her tongue .
&quot; I don &apos;t like favors ; they <unk> and make me feel like a slave .
I &apos;d rather do everything for myself , and be perfectly independent . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> Aunt Carrol softly , with a look at Aunt March .
&quot; I told you so , &quot; said Aunt March , with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol .
<unk> unconscious of what she had done , Jo sat with her nose in the air , and a <unk> aspect which was anything but inviting .
&quot; Do you speak French , dear ? &quot;
asked Mrs. Carrol , laying her hand on Amy &apos;s .
&quot; <unk> well , thanks to Aunt March , who lets Esther talk to me as often as I like , &quot; replied Amy , with a grateful look , which caused the old lady to smile <unk> .
&quot; How are you about languages ? &quot;
asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo .
&quot; Don &apos;t know a word ; I &apos;m very stupid about studying anything ; can &apos;t bear French , it &apos;s such a <unk> , silly sort of language , &quot; was the _ <unk> _ reply .
Another look passed between the ladies , and Aunt March said to Amy , &quot; You are quite strong and well , now , dear , I believe ?
<unk> don &apos;t trouble you any more , do they ? &quot;
&quot; Not at all , thank you , ma &apos;am .
I &apos;m very well , and mean to do great things next winter , so that I may be ready for Rome , whenever that joyful time <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Good girl !
You deserve to go , and I &apos;m sure you will some day , &quot; said Aunt March , with an approving pat on the head , as Amy picked up her ball for her .
&quot; <unk> , draw the <unk> , Sit by the fire and <unk> , &quot; <unk> Polly , bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into Jo &apos;s face , with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing .
&quot; Most observing bird , &quot; said the old lady .
&quot; Come and take a walk , my dear ? &quot;
cried Polly , <unk> toward the china-closet , with a look suggestive of <unk> .
&quot; Thank you , I will .
Come , Amy ; &quot; and Jo brought the visit to an end , feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her <unk> .
She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner , but Amy kissed both the aunts , and the girls departed , leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine ; which impression caused Aunt March to say , as they vanished , -- &quot; You &apos;d better do it , Mary ; I &apos;ll supply the money , &quot; and Aunt Carrol to reply decidedly , &quot; I certainly will , if her father and mother consent . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : You shall have another table &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
Mrs. Chester &apos;s fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table , and every one was much interested in the matter .
Amy was asked , but Jo was not , which was fortunate for all parties , as her elbows were decidedly <unk> at this period of her life , and it took a good many hard <unk> to teach her how to get on easily .
The &quot; haughty , uninteresting creature &quot; was let <unk> alone ; but Amy &apos;s talent and taste were <unk> <unk> by the offer of the art-table , and she <unk> herself to prepare and <unk> appropriate and valuable contributions to it .
Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened ; then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid , when some five and twenty women , old and young , with all their private <unk> and <unk> , try to work together .
May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself , and , just at this time , several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling .
Amy &apos;s dainty <unk> work entirely <unk> May &apos;s painted vases , --that was one <unk> ; then the <unk> Tudor had danced four times with Amy , at a late party , and only once with May , --that was <unk> number two ; but the chief <unk> that <unk> in her soul , and gave her an excuse for her <unk> <unk> , was a <unk> which some obliging gossip had whispered to her , that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs &apos; .
All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo , for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape <unk> , and the <unk> Lambs had permitted the joke to escape .
No hint of this had reached the <unk> , however , and Amy &apos;s dismay can be imagined , when , the very evening before the fair , as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table , Mrs. Chester , who , of course , resented the supposed <unk> of her daughter , said , in a <unk> tone , but with a cold look , -- &quot; I find , dear , that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to any one but my girls .
As this is the most <unk> , and some say the most attractive table of all , and they are the chief <unk> of the fair , it is thought best for them to take this place .
I &apos;m sorry , but I know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little <unk> disappointment , and you shall have another table if you like . &quot;
Mrs. Chester had fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech ; but when the time came , she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally , with Amy &apos;s <unk> eyes looking straight at her , full of surprise and trouble .
Amy felt that there was something behind this , but could not guess what , and said quietly , feeling hurt , and showing that she did , -- &quot; Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all ? &quot;
&quot; Now , my dear , don &apos;t have any ill feeling , I beg ; it &apos;s merely a matter of <unk> , you see ; my girls will naturally take the lead , and this table is considered their proper place .
_ I _ think it very appropriate to you , and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty ; but we must give up our private wishes , of course , and I will see that you have a good place elsewhere .
Wouldn &apos;t you like the flower-table ?
The little girls undertook it , but they are <unk> .
You could make a charming thing of it , and the flower-table is always attractive , you know . &quot;
&quot; <unk> to gentlemen , &quot; added May , with a look which enlightened Amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor .
She colored angrily , but took no other notice of that girlish <unk> , and answered , with unexpected <unk> , -- &quot; It shall be as you please , Mrs. Chester .
I &apos;ll give up my place here at once , and attend to the flowers , if you like . &quot;
&quot; You can put your own things on your own table , if you prefer , &quot; began May , feeling a little <unk> , as she looked at the pretty <unk> , the painted <unk> , and quaint <unk> Amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged .
She meant it kindly , but Amy <unk> her meaning , and said quickly , -- &quot; Oh , certainly , if they are in your way ; &quot; and sweeping her contributions into her apron , pell-mell , she walked off , feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past <unk> .
&quot; Now she &apos;s mad .
Oh , dear , I wish I hadn &apos;t asked you to speak , mamma , &quot; said May , looking <unk> at the empty <unk> on her table .
&quot; Girls &apos; quarrels are soon over , &quot; returned her mother , feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one , as well she might .
The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight , which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit , and she fell to work , determined to succeed <unk> , if she could not artistically .
But everything seemed against her : it was late , and she was tired ; every one was too busy with their own affairs to help her ; and the little girls were only <unk> , for the dears fussed and chattered like so many <unk> , making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order .
The <unk> arch wouldn &apos;t stay firm after she got it up , but <unk> and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled ; her best <unk> got a splash of water , which left a <unk> tear on the <unk> &apos;s cheek ; she <unk> her hands with hammering , and got cold working in a <unk> , which last affliction filled her with <unk> for the <unk> .
Any <unk> who has suffered like <unk> will sympathize with poor Amy , and wish her well through with her task .
There was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening .
Her mother said it was a shame , but told her she had done right ; Beth declared she wouldn &apos;t go to the fair at all ; and Jo demanded why she didn &apos;t take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her .
&quot; Because they are mean is no reason why I should be .
I hate such things , and though I think I &apos;ve a right to be hurt , I don &apos;t intend to show it .
They will feel that more than angry speeches or <unk> <unk> , won &apos;t they , Marmee ? &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s the right spirit , my dear ; a kiss for a blow is always best , though it &apos;s not very easy to give it sometimes , &quot; said her mother , with the air of one who had learned the difference between <unk> and practising .
In spite of various very natural temptations to <unk> and <unk> , Amy <unk> to her resolution all the next day , bent on <unk> her enemy by kindness .
She began well , thanks to a silent <unk> that came to her unexpectedly , but most <unk> .
As she arranged her table that morning , while the little girls were in an <unk> filling the baskets , she took up her pet <unk> , --a little book , the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures , and in which , on leaves of <unk> , she had beautifully illuminated different <unk> .
As she turned the pages , rich in dainty devices , with very pardonable pride , her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think .
<unk> in a brilliant <unk> of scarlet , blue , and gold , with little spirits of good-will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers , were the words , &quot; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I ought , but I don &apos;t , &quot; thought Amy , as her eye went from the bright page to May &apos;s discontented face behind the big vases , that could not hide the <unk> her pretty work had once filled .
Amy stood a minute , turning the leaves in her hand , reading on each some sweet <unk> for all <unk> and <unk> of spirit .
Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious <unk> in street , school , office , or home ; even a <unk> may become a <unk> , if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season .
Amy &apos;s conscience preached her a little sermon from that <unk> , then and there ; and she did what many of us do not always do , <unk> the sermon to heart , and <unk> put it in practice .
A group of girls were standing about May &apos;s table , admiring the pretty things , and talking over the change of <unk> .
They dropped their voices , but Amy knew they were speaking of her , hearing one side of the story , and judging <unk> .
It was not pleasant , but a better spirit had come over her , and presently a chance offered for proving it .
She heard May say sorrowfully , -- &quot; It &apos;s too bad , for there is no time to make other things , and I don &apos;t want to fill up with <unk> and ends .
The table was just complete then : now it &apos;s spoilt . &quot;
&quot; I dare say she &apos;d put them back if you asked her , &quot; suggested some one .
&quot; How could I after all the fuss ? &quot;
began May , but she did not finish , for Amy &apos;s voice came across the hall , saying pleasantly , -- &quot; You may have them , and welcome , without asking , if you want them .
I was just thinking I &apos;d offer to put them back , for they belong to your table rather than mine .
Here they are ; please take them , and forgive me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night . &quot;
As she spoke , Amy returned her <unk> , with a nod and a smile , and hurried away again , feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it .
&quot; Now , I call that lovely of her , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
cried one girl .
May &apos;s answer was <unk> ; but another young lady , whose temper was evidently a little <unk> by making lemonade , added , with a disagreeable laugh , &quot; Very lovely ; for she knew she wouldn &apos;t sell them at her own table . &quot;
Now , that was hard ; when we make little sacrifices we like to have them <unk> , at least ; and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it , feeling that virtue was not always its own reward .
But it is , <unk> she presently discovered ; for her spirits began to rise , and her table to blossom under her <unk> hands ; the girls were very kind , and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly .
It was a very long day , and a hard one to Amy , as she sat behind her table , often quite alone , for the little girls deserted very soon : few cared to buy flowers in summer , and her bouquets began to <unk> long before night .
The art-table _ was _ the most attractive in the room ; there was a <unk> about it all day long , and the <unk> were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling <unk> .
Amy often looked wistfully across , longing to be there , where she felt at home and happy , instead of in a corner with nothing to do .
It might seem no <unk> to some of us ; but to a pretty , blithe young girl , it was not only <unk> , but very trying ; and the thought of being found there in the evening by her family , and Laurie and his friends , made it a real <unk> .
She did not go home till night , and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one , though she made no <unk> , and did not even tell what she had done .
Her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea , Beth helped her dress , and made a charming little wreath for her hair , while Jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care , and <unk> darkly that the tables were about to be turned .
&quot; Don &apos;t do anything rude , pray , Jo .
I won &apos;t have any fuss made , so let it all pass , and behave yourself , &quot; begged Amy , as she departed early , hoping to find a <unk> of flowers to refresh her poor little table .
&quot; I merely intend to make myself <unk> agreeable to every one I know , and to keep them in your corner as long as possible .
Teddy and his boys will lend a hand , and we &apos;ll have a good time yet , &quot; returned Jo , leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie .
Presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk , and she ran out to meet him .
&quot; Is that my boy ? &quot;
&quot; As sure as this is my girl ! &quot;
and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm , with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified .
&quot; O Teddy , such <unk> ! &quot;
and Jo told Amy &apos;s wrongs with sisterly <unk> .
&quot; A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by and by , and I &apos;ll be <unk> if I don &apos;t make them buy every flower she &apos;s got , and camp down before her table afterward , &quot; said Laurie , <unk> her cause with warmth .
&quot; The flowers are not at all nice , Amy says , and the fresh ones may not arrive in time .
I don &apos;t wish to be unjust or suspicious , but I shouldn &apos;t wonder if they never came at all .
When people do one mean thing they are very likely to do another , &quot; observed Jo , in a disgusted tone .
&quot; Didn &apos;t Hayes give you the best out of our gardens ?
I told him to . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t know that ; he forgot , I suppose ; and , as your grandpa was poorly , I didn &apos;t like to worry him by asking , though I did want some . &quot;
&quot; Now , Jo , how could you think there was any need of asking !
They are just as much yours as mine .
Don &apos;t we always go halves in everything ? &quot;
began Laurie , in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny .
&quot; <unk> , I hope not !
half of some of your things wouldn &apos;t suit me at all .
But we mustn &apos;t stand philandering here ; I &apos;ve got to help Amy , so you go and make yourself splendid ; and if you &apos;ll be so very kind as to let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall , I &apos;ll bless you forever . &quot;
&quot; Couldn &apos;t you do it now ? &quot;
asked Laurie , so <unk> that Jo shut the gate in his face with <unk> haste , and called through the bars , &quot; Go away , Teddy ; I &apos;m busy . &quot;
Thanks to the <unk> , the tables _ were _ turned that night ; for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers , with a lovely basket , arranged in his best manner , for a <unk> ; then the March family turned out _ en <unk> _ , and Jo <unk> herself to some purpose , for people not only came , but stayed , laughing at her nonsense , admiring Amy &apos;s taste , and apparently enjoying themselves very much .
Laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the <unk> , bought up the bouquets , <unk> before the table , and made that corner the <unk> spot in the room .
Amy was in her element now , and , out of gratitude , if nothing more , was as sprightly and gracious as possible , <unk> to the conclusion , about that time , that virtue _ was _ its own reward , after all .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> up the bouquets &#93; Jo behaved herself with <unk> propriety ; and when Amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor , Jo <unk> about the hall , picking up various bits of gossip , which enlightened her upon the subject of the Chester change of <unk> .
She <unk> herself for her share of the <unk> , and resolved to <unk> Amy as soon as possible ; she also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning , and considered her a model of <unk> .
As she passed the art-table , she glanced over it for her sister &apos;s things , but saw no signs of them .
&quot; <unk> away out of sight , I dare say , &quot; thought Jo , who could forgive her own wrongs , but <unk> resented any insult offered to her family .
&quot; Good evening , Miss Jo .
How does Amy get on ? &quot;
asked May , with a <unk> air , for she wanted to show that she also could be generous .
&quot; She has sold everything she had that was worth selling , and now she is enjoying herself .
The flower-table is always attractive , you know , &apos; especially to gentlemen . &apos; &quot;
Jo _ couldn &apos;t _ resist giving that little slap , but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after , and fell to <unk> the great vases , which still remained <unk> .
&quot; Is Amy &apos;s <unk> anywhere about ?
I took a fancy to buy that for father , &quot; said Jo , very anxious to learn the fate of her sister &apos;s work .
&quot; Everything of Amy &apos;s sold long ago ; I took care that the right people saw them , and they made a nice little sum of money for us , &quot; returned May , who had overcome sundry small temptations , as well as Amy , that day .
Much gratified , Jo rushed back to tell the good news ; and Amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of May &apos;s words and manner .
&quot; Now , gentlemen , I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by <unk> the art-table , &quot; she said , <unk> out &quot; Teddy &apos;s <unk> , &quot; as the girls called the college friends .
&quot; &apos; <unk> , Chester , charge ! &apos;
is the motto for that table ; but do your duty like men , and you &apos;ll get your money &apos;s worth of _ art _ in every sense of the word , &quot; said the irrepressible Jo , as the devoted <unk> prepared to take the field .
&quot; To hear is to obey , but March is fairer far than May , &quot; said little Parker , making a <unk> effort to be both witty and tender , and getting promptly quenched by Laurie , who said , &quot; Very well , my son , for a small boy ! &quot;
and walked him off , with a paternal pat on the head .
&quot; <unk> the vases , &quot; whispered Amy to Laurie , as a final <unk> of <unk> of fire on her enemy &apos;s head .
To May &apos;s great delight , Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases , but pervaded the hall with one under each arm .
The other gentlemen <unk> with equal <unk> in all sorts of frail trifles , and <unk> <unk> about afterward , <unk> with <unk> flowers , painted <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and other useful and appropriate <unk> .
Aunt Carrol was there , heard the story , looked pleased , and said something to Mrs. March in a corner , which made the latter lady beam with satisfaction , and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety , though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later .
The fair was pronounced a success ; and when May bade Amy good night , she did not &quot; <unk> &quot; as usual , but gave her an affectionate kiss , and a look which said , &quot; Forgive and forget . &quot;
That satisfied Amy ; and when she got home she found the vases <unk> on the parlor <unk> , with a great bouquet in each .
&quot; The reward of <unk> for a <unk> March , &quot; as Laurie announced with a flourish .
&quot; You &apos;ve a deal more <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of character than I ever gave you credit for , Amy .
You &apos;ve behaved sweetly , and I respect you with all my heart , &quot; said Jo warmly , as they brushed their hair together late that night .
&quot; Yes , we all do , and love her for being so ready to forgive .
It must have been dreadfully hard , after working so long , and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things .
I don &apos;t believe I could have done it as kindly as you did , &quot; added Beth from her pillow .
&quot; Why , girls , you needn &apos;t praise me so ; I only did as I &apos;d be done by .
You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady , but I mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners , and I try to do it as far as I know how .
I can &apos;t explain exactly , but I want to be above the little <unk> and <unk> and faults that spoil so many women .
I &apos;m far from it now , but I do my best , and hope in time to be what mother is . &quot;
Amy spoke earnestly , and Jo said , with a cordial hug , -- &quot; I understand now what you mean , and I &apos;ll never laugh at you again .
You are getting on <unk> than you think , and I &apos;ll take lessons of you in true <unk> , for you &apos;ve learned the secret , I believe .
Try away , deary ; you &apos;ll get your reward some day , and no one will be more delighted than I shall . &quot;
A week later Amy did get her reward , and poor Jo found it hard to be delighted .
A letter came from Aunt Carrol , and Mrs. March &apos;s face was illuminated to such a degree , when she read it , that Jo and Beth , who were with her , demanded what the glad <unk> were .
&quot; Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month , and <unk> &quot; &quot; Me to go with her ! &quot;
burst in Jo , flying out of her chair in an <unk> rapture .
&quot; No , dear , not you ; it &apos;s Amy . &quot;
&quot; O mother !
she &apos;s too young ; it &apos;s my turn first .
I &apos;ve wanted it so <unk> would do me so much good , and be so altogether <unk> _ must _ go . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s impossible , Jo .
Aunt says Amy , decidedly , and it is not for us to <unk> when she offers such a favor . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s always so .
Amy has all the fun and I have all the work .
It isn &apos;t fair , oh , it isn &apos;t fair ! &quot;
cried Jo passionately .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid it is partly your own fault , dear .
When Aunt spoke to me the other day , she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit ; and here she writes , as if quoting something you had said , -- &apos; I planned at first to ask Jo ; but as &quot; favors burden her , &quot; and she &quot; hates French , &quot; I think I won &apos;t venture to invite her .
Amy is more docile , will make a good companion for Flo , and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Oh , my tongue , my abominable tongue !
why can &apos;t I learn to keep it quiet ? &quot;
groaned Jo , remembering words which had been her <unk> .
When she had heard the explanation of the <unk> phrases , Mrs. March said sorrowfully , -- &quot; I wish you could have gone , but there is no hope of it this time ; so try to bear it cheerfully , and don &apos;t <unk> Amy &apos;s pleasure by <unk> or regrets . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll try , &quot; said Jo , winking hard , as she <unk> down to pick up the basket she had joyfully upset .
&quot; I &apos;ll take a leaf out of her book , and try not only to seem glad , but to be so , and not <unk> her one minute of happiness ; but it won &apos;t be easy , for it is a dreadful disappointment ; &quot; and poor Jo <unk> the little fat <unk> she held with several very bitter tears .
&quot; Jo , dear , I &apos;m very selfish , but I couldn &apos;t spare you , and I &apos;m glad you are not going quite yet , &quot; whispered Beth , <unk> her , basket and all , with such a clinging touch and loving face , that Jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears , and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor , and see how gratefully she would bear it .
By the time Amy came in , Jo was able to take her part in the family <unk> ; not quite as heartily as usual , perhaps , but without <unk> at Amy &apos;s good fortune .
The young lady herself received the news as <unk> of great joy , went about in a solemn sort of rapture , and began to sort her colors and <unk> her pencils that evening , leaving such trifles as clothes , money , and <unk> to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself .
&quot; It isn &apos;t a mere pleasure trip to me , girls , &quot; she said impressively , as she <unk> her best <unk> .
&quot; It will decide my <unk> ; for if I have any genius , I shall find it out in Rome , and will do something to prove it . &quot;
&quot; Suppose you haven &apos;t ? &quot;
said Jo , sewing away , with red eyes , at the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy .
&quot; Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living , &quot; replied the <unk> for fame , with philosophic <unk> ; but she made a wry face at the prospect , and <unk> away at her <unk> as if bent on <unk> <unk> before she gave up her hopes .
&quot; No , you won &apos;t ; you hate hard work , and you &apos;ll marry some rich man , and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days , &quot; said Jo .
&quot; Your <unk> sometimes come to pass , but I don &apos;t believe that one will .
I &apos;m sure I wish it would , for if I can &apos;t be an artist myself , I should like to be able to help those who are , &quot; said Amy , smiling , as if the part of Lady <unk> would suit her better than that of a poor <unk> .
&quot; Hum ! &quot;
said Jo , with a sigh ; &quot; if you wish it you &apos;ll have it , for your wishes are always <unk> never . &quot;
&quot; Would you like to go ? &quot;
asked Amy , thoughtfully patting her nose with her <unk> .
&quot; Rather ! &quot;
&quot; Well , in a year or two I &apos;ll send for you , and we &apos;ll dig in the <unk> for relics , and carry out all the plans we &apos;ve made so many times . &quot;
&quot; Thank you ; I &apos;ll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes , if it ever does , &quot; returned Jo , accepting the vague but <unk> offer as gratefully as she could .
There was not much time for preparation , and the house was in a <unk> till Amy was off .
Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished , when she retired to her refuge , the garret , and cried till she couldn &apos;t cry any more .
Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the <unk> sailed ; then , just as the <unk> was about to be <unk> , it suddenly came over her that a whole <unk> was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best , and she clung to Laurie , the last <unk> , saying with a sob , -- &quot; Oh , take care of them for me ; and if anything should <unk> &quot; &quot; I will , dear , I will ; and if anything happens , I &apos;ll come and comfort you , &quot; whispered Laurie , little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word .
So Amy sailed away to find the old world , which is always new and beautiful to young eyes , while her father and friend watched her from the shore , <unk> hoping that none but gentle fortunes would <unk> the happy-hearted girl , who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine <unk> on the sea .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : Flo and I ordered a <unk> &#93; <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> .
&quot; DEAREST <unk> , -- &quot; Here I really sit at a front window of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s not a fashionable place , but uncle stopped here years ago , and won &apos;t go anywhere else ; however , we don &apos;t mean to stay long , so it &apos;s no great matter .
Oh , I can &apos;t begin to tell you how I enjoy it all !
I never can , so I &apos;ll only give you bits out of my <unk> , for I &apos;ve done nothing but sketch and <unk> since I started .
&quot; I sent a line from <unk> , when I felt pretty miserable , but after that I got on delightfully , seldom ill , on <unk> all day , with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me .
Every one was very kind to me , especially the officers .
Don &apos;t laugh , Jo ; gentlemen really are very necessary <unk> ship , to hold on to , or to wait upon one ; and as they have nothing to do , it &apos;s a mercy to make them useful , otherwise they would smoke themselves to death , I &apos;m afraid .
&#91; Illustration : &quot; Every one was very kind , especially the officers . &quot;
--Page <unk> . &#93;
&quot; Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way , and liked to be let alone , so when I had done what I could for them , I went and enjoyed myself .
Such walks on <unk> , such <unk> , such splendid air and <unk> !
It was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse , when we went rushing on so <unk> .
I wish Beth could have come , it would have done her so much good ; as for Jo , she would have gone up and sat on the <unk> <unk> , or whatever the high thing is called , made friends with the <unk> , and <unk> on the captain &apos;s <unk> , she &apos;d have been in such a state of rapture .
&quot; It was all heavenly , but I was glad to see the Irish <unk> , and found it very lovely , so green and sunny , with brown <unk> here and there , ruins on some of the hills , and gentlemen &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> , with deer feeding in the <unk> .
It was early in the morning , but I didn &apos;t regret getting up to see it , for the <unk> was full of little boats , the shore _ so _ picturesque , and a rosy sky overhead .
I never shall forget it .
&quot; At <unk> one of my new acquaintances left us , <unk> . Lennox , --and when I said something about the <unk> of <unk> , he sighed and sung , with a look at me , -- &apos; Oh , have you e &apos;er heard of Kate <unk> ?
She lives on the banks of <unk> ; From the glance of her eye , <unk> danger and fly , For <unk> &apos;s the glance of Kate <unk> . &apos;
Wasn &apos;t that nonsensical ?
&quot; We only stopped at <unk> a few hours .
It &apos;s a dirty , <unk> place , and I was glad to leave it .
Uncle rushed out and bought a pair of <unk> gloves , some ugly , thick shoes , and an umbrella , and got <unk> _ ?
la _ <unk> , the first thing .
Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true <unk> ; but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes , the little <unk> knew that an American stood in them , and said , with a <unk> , &apos; There yer <unk> , sir .
I &apos;ve give &apos; em the latest Yankee shine . &apos;
It amused uncle immensely .
Oh , I _ must _ tell you what that absurd Lennox did !
He got his friend <unk> , who came on with us , to order a bouquet for me , and the first thing I saw in my room was a lovely one , with &apos; <unk> Lennox &apos;s compliments , &apos; on the card .
Wasn &apos;t that fun , girls ?
I like travelling .
&quot; I never _ shall _ get to London if I don &apos;t hurry .
The trip was like riding through a long <unk> , full of lovely <unk> .
The <unk> were my delight ; with <unk> <unk> , ivy up to the <unk> , <unk> windows , and stout women with rosy children at the doors .
The very <unk> looked more tranquil than ours , as they stood <unk> in <unk> , and the <unk> had a contented <unk> , as if they never got nervous , like Yankee <unk> .
Such perfect color I never saw , --the grass so green , sky so blue , <unk> so yellow , <unk> so dark , --I was in a rapture all the way .
So was Flo ; and we kept <unk> from one side to the other , trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour .
Aunt was tired and went to sleep , but uncle read his guide-book , and wouldn &apos;t be astonished at anything .
This is the way we went on : Amy , flying up , -- &apos; Oh , that must be <unk> , that gray place among the trees ! &apos;
Flo , <unk> to my window , -- &apos; How sweet !
We must go there some time , won &apos;t we , papa ? &apos;
Uncle , calmly admiring his boots , -- &apos; No , my dear , not unless you want <unk> ; that &apos;s a <unk> . &apos;
&quot; A pause , <unk> Flo cried out , &apos; Bless me , there &apos;s a <unk> and a man going up . &apos;
<unk> , where ? &apos;
<unk> Amy , staring out at two tall <unk> with a <unk> and some <unk> chains .
<unk> <unk> , &apos; remarks uncle , with a twinkle of the eye .
<unk> &apos;s a lovely flock of <unk> all lying down , &apos; says Amy .
<unk> , papa , aren &apos;t they pretty ! &apos;
added Flo <unk> .
<unk> , young ladies , &apos; <unk> uncle , in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo <unk> down to enjoy &apos; The <unk> of <unk>
<unk> , &apos; and I have the scenery all to myself .
&quot; Of course it <unk> when we got to London , and there was nothing to be seen but fog and <unk> .
We rested , <unk> , and <unk> a little between the <unk> .
Aunt Mary got me some new things , for I came off in such a hurry I wasn &apos;t half ready .
A white hat and blue feather , a muslin dress to match , and the <unk> <unk> you ever saw .
<unk> in <unk> <unk> is perfectly splendid ; things seem so <unk> ribbons only <unk> a <unk> .
I laid in a stock , but shall get my gloves in Paris .
Doesn &apos;t that sound sort of elegant and rich ?
&quot; Flo and I , for the fun of it , ordered a <unk> <unk> , while aunt and uncle were out , and went for a drive , though we learned afterward that it wasn &apos;t the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone .
It was so droll !
for when we were shut in by the wooden apron , the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened , and told me to stop him .
But he was up outside behind somewhere , and I couldn &apos;t get at him .
He didn &apos;t hear me call , nor see me flap my parasol in front , and there we were , quite helpless , rattling away , and <unk> around corners at a <unk> pace .
At last , in my despair , I saw a little door in the roof , and on poking it open , a red eye appeared , and a <unk> voice said , -- &quot; &apos; Now then , mum ? &apos;
&quot; I gave my order as soberly as I could , and slamming down the door , with an &apos; <unk> , <unk> , mum , &apos; the man made his horse walk , as if going to a funeral .
I poked again , and said , &apos; A little <unk> ; &apos; then off he went , <unk> , as before , and we resigned ourselves to our fate .
&quot; <unk> was fair and we went to <unk> <unk> , close by , for we are more aristocratic than we look .
The Duke of <unk> lives near .
I often see his <unk> lounging at the back gate ; and the Duke of <unk> &apos;s house is not far off .
Such <unk> as I saw , my dear !
It was as good as <unk> , for there were fat <unk> rolling about in their red and yellow <unk> , with gorgeous <unk> in silk stockings and velvet <unk> , up behind , and <unk> <unk> in front .
<unk> maids , with the <unk> children I ever saw ; handsome girls , looking half asleep ; <unk> , in queer English hats and lavender <unk> , lounging about , and tall soldiers , in short red jackets and <unk> caps stuck on one side , looking so funny I longed to sketch them .
&quot; <unk> Row means &apos; _ <unk> de <unk> _ , &apos; or the king &apos;s way ; but now it &apos;s more like a <unk> than anything else .
The horses are splendid , and the men , especially the grooms , ride well ; but the women are stiff , and bounce , which isn &apos;t according to our rules .
I longed to show them a tearing American <unk> , for they <unk> solemnly up and down , in their <unk> habits and high hats , looking like the women in a <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
Every one rides , <unk> men , stout ladies , little children , --and the young folks do a deal of flirting here ; I saw a pair <unk> <unk> , for it &apos;s the thing to wear one in the button-hole , and I thought it rather a nice little idea .
&quot; In the <unk> to <unk> <unk> ; but don &apos;t expect me to describe it , that &apos;s <unk> I &apos;ll only say it was <unk> !
This evening we are going to see <unk> , which will be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life .
&quot; <unk> .
&quot; It &apos;s very late , but I can &apos;t let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening .
Who do you think came in , as we were at tea ?
Laurie &apos;s English friends , Fred and Frank Vaughn !
I was _ so _ surprised , for I shouldn &apos;t have known them but for the cards .
Both are tall fellows , with <unk> ; Fred handsome in the English style , and Frank much better , for he only <unk> <unk> , and <unk> no <unk> .
They had heard from Laurie where we were to be , and came to ask us to their house ; but uncle won &apos;t go , so we shall return the call , and see them as we can .
They went to the theatre with us , and we did have _ such _ a good time , for Frank devoted himself to Flo , and Fred and I talked over past , present , and future fun as if we had known each other all our days .
Tell Beth Frank asked for her , and was sorry to hear of her ill health .
Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo , and sent his &apos; respectful compliments to the big hat . &apos;
Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence , or the fun we had there .
What ages ago it seems , doesn &apos;t it ?
&quot; Aunt is <unk> on the wall for the third time , so I _ must _ stop .
I really feel like a <unk> London fine lady , writing here so late , with my room full of pretty things , and my head a <unk> of <unk> , theatres , new gowns , and gallant creatures who say &apos; Ah ! &apos;
and <unk> their <unk> <unk> with the true English <unk> .
I long to see you all , and in spite of my nonsense am , as ever , your loving AMY . &quot;
&quot; DEAR GIRLS , -- &quot; <unk> .
&quot; In my last I told you about our London visit , --how kind the Vaughns were , and what pleasant parties they made for us .
I enjoyed the trips to <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> more than anything else , --for at <unk> I saw Raphael &apos;s <unk> , and , at the <unk> , rooms full of pictures by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the other great creatures .
The day in <unk> <unk> was charming , for we had a regular English picnic , and I had more splendid <unk> and <unk> of deer than I could copy ; also heard a <unk> , and saw larks go up .
We &apos; did &apos; London to our hearts &apos; content , thanks to Fred and Frank , and were sorry to go away ; for , though English people are slow to take you in , when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be <unk> in hospitality , _ I _ think .
The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter , and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they don &apos;t , for Grace and I are great friends , and the boys very nice fellows , <unk> Fred .
&quot; Well , we were hardly settled here , when he turned up again , saying he had come for a holiday , and was going to Switzerland .
Aunt looked sober at first , but he was so cool about it she couldn &apos;t say a word ; and now we get on nicely , and are very glad he came , for he speaks French like a native , and I don &apos;t know what we should do without him .
Uncle doesn &apos;t know ten words , and <unk> on talking English very loud , as if that would make people understand him .
Aunt &apos;s pronunciation is old-fashioned , and Flo and I , though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal , find we don &apos;t , and are very grateful to have Fred do the &apos; _ <unk> <unk> _ , &apos; as uncle calls it .
&quot; Such delightful times as we are having !
<unk> from morning till night , stopping for nice <unk> in the gay _ <unk> ? s _ , and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures .
<unk> days I spend in the <unk> , <unk> in pictures .
Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest , because she has no soul for art ; but _ I _ have , and I &apos;m <unk> eye and taste as fast as I can .
She would like the relics of great people better , for I &apos;ve seen her Napoleon &apos;s cocked hat and gray coat , his baby &apos;s <unk> and his old <unk> ; also <unk> <unk> &apos;s little shoe , the ring of Saint <unk> , <unk> &apos;s sword , and many other interesting things .
I &apos;ll talk for hours about them when I come , but haven &apos;t time to write .
&quot; The <unk> <unk> is a heavenly place , --so full of _ <unk> _ and lovely things that I &apos;m nearly distracted because I can &apos;t buy them .
Fred wanted to get me some , but of course I didn &apos;t allow it .
Then the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> ? <unk> are _ <unk> ? s <unk> _ .
I &apos;ve seen the imperial family several times , --the <unk> an ugly , <unk> man , the <unk> pale and pretty , but dressed in bad taste , _ I _ thought , <unk> dress , green hat , and yellow gloves .
Little <unk> .
is a handsome boy , who sits chatting to his tutor , and kisses his hand to the people as he <unk> in his <unk> <unk> , with <unk> in red satin jackets , and a mounted guard before and behind .
&#91; Illustration : I &apos;ve seen the imperial family several times &#93; &quot; We often walk in the <unk> <unk> , for they are lovely , though the antique <unk> <unk> suit me better .
<unk> ? <unk> la <unk> is very curious , for many of the <unk> are like small rooms , and , looking in , one sees a table , with <unk> or pictures of the dead , and chairs for the <unk> to sit in when they come to lament .
That is so <unk> .
&quot; Our rooms are on the <unk> de <unk> , and , sitting in the <unk> , we look up and down the long , brilliant street .
It is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there , when too tired with our day &apos;s work to go out .
Fred is very <unk> , and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever knew , <unk> Laurie , whose manners are more charming .
I wish Fred was dark , for I don &apos;t fancy light men ; however , the Vaughns are very rich , and come of an excellent family , so I won &apos;t find fault with their yellow hair , as my own is <unk> .
&quot; Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland ; and , as we shall travel fast , I shall only be able to give you hasty letters .
I keep my <unk> , and try to &apos; remember <unk> and describe <unk> all that I see and admire , &apos; as father advised .
It is good practice for me , and , with my sketch-book , will give you a better idea of my tour than these <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ; I embrace you tenderly .
<unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; MY DEAR <unk> , -- &quot; <unk> .
&quot; Having a quiet hour before we leave for <unk> , I &apos;ll try to tell you what has happened , for some of it is very important , as you will see .
&quot; The sail up the <unk> was perfect , and I just sat and enjoyed it with all my might .
Get father &apos;s old <unk> , and read about it ; I haven &apos;t words beautiful enough to describe it .
At <unk> we had a lovely time , for some students from <unk> , with whom Fred got acquainted on the boat , gave us a serenade .
It was a moonlight night , and , about one o &apos;clock , Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our windows .
We flew up , and hid behind the curtains ; but sly peeps showed us Fred and the students singing away down below .
It was the most romantic thing I ever saw , --the river , the bridge of boats , the great <unk> opposite , moonlight everywhere , and music fit to melt a heart of stone .
&quot; When they were done we threw down some flowers , and saw them <unk> for them , kiss their hands to the invisible ladies , and go laughing away , --to smoke and drink <unk> , I suppose .
Next morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his <unk> , and looked very sentimental .
I laughed at him , and said I didn &apos;t throw it , but Flo , which seemed to disgust him , for he tossed it out of the window , and turned sensible again .
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have trouble with that boy , it begins to look like it .
&quot; The <unk> at <unk> were very gay , so was <unk> , where Fred lost some money , and I scolded him .
He needs some one to look after him when Frank is not with him .
Kate said once she hoped he &apos;d marry soon , and I quite agree with her that it would be well for him .
<unk> was delightful ; I saw <unk> &apos;s house , Schiller &apos;s statue , and <unk> &apos;s famous &apos; <unk> . &apos;
It was very lovely , but I should have enjoyed it more if I had known the story better .
I didn &apos;t like to ask , as every one knew it , or <unk> they did .
I wish Jo would tell me all about it ; I ought to have read more , for I find I don &apos;t know anything , and it <unk> me .
&quot; Now comes the serious part , --for it happened here , and Fred is just gone .
He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him ; I never thought of anything but a travelling friendship , till the serenade night .
Since then I &apos;ve begun to feel that the moonlight walks , <unk> talks , and daily adventures were something more to him than fun .
I haven &apos;t flirted , mother , truly , but remembered what you said to me , and have done my very best .
I can &apos;t help it if people like me ; I don &apos;t try to make them , and it worries me if I don &apos;t care for them , though Jo says I haven &apos;t got any heart .
Now I know mother will shake her head , and the girls say , &apos; Oh , the mercenary little wretch ! &apos;
but I &apos;ve made up my mind , and , if Fred <unk> me , I shall accept him , though I &apos;m not <unk> in love .
I like him , and we get on comfortably together .
He is handsome , young , clever enough , and very rich , <unk> so much richer than the Laurences .
I don &apos;t think his family would object , and I should be very happy , for they are all kind , well-bred , generous people , and they like me .
Fred , as the eldest <unk> , will have the <unk> , I suppose , and such a splendid one as it is !
A city house in a fashionable street , not so <unk> as our big houses , but twice as comfortable , and full of <unk> luxury , such as English people believe in .
I like it , for it &apos;s genuine .
I &apos;ve seen the plate , the family <unk> , the old servants , and pictures of the country place , with its <unk> , great house , lovely grounds , and fine horses .
Oh , it would be all I should ask !
and I &apos;d rather have it than any title such as girls <unk> up so <unk> , and find nothing behind .
I may be mercenary , but I hate poverty , and don &apos;t mean to bear it a minute longer than I can help .
One of us _ must _ marry well ; Meg didn &apos;t , Jo won &apos;t , Beth can &apos;t yet , so I shall , and make everything cosey all round .
I wouldn &apos;t marry a man I hated or <unk> .
You may be sure of that ; and , though Fred is not my model hero , he does very well , and , in time , I should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me , and let me do just as I liked .
So I &apos;ve been turning the matter over in my mind the last week , for it was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me .
He said nothing , but little things showed it ; he never goes with Flo , always gets on my side of the carriage , table , or promenade , looks sentimental when we are alone , and <unk> at any one else who <unk> to speak to me .
Yesterday , at dinner , when an <unk> <unk> stared at us , and then said something to his friend , --a <unk> <unk> , <unk> &apos; _ <unk> <unk> ? <unk> <unk> ? <unk> _ , &apos; Fred looked as fierce as a lion , and cut his <unk> so <unk> , it nearly flew off his plate .
He isn &apos;t one of the cool , stiff <unk> , but is rather <unk> , for he has <unk> blood in him , as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes .
&quot; Well , last evening we went up to the castle about sunset , --at least all of us but Fred , who was to meet us there , after going to the <unk> <unk> for letters .
We had a charming time poking about the ruins , the <unk> where the <unk> <unk> is , and the beautiful gardens made by the <unk> , long ago , for his English wife .
I liked the great terrace best , for the view was divine ; so , while the rest went to see the rooms inside , I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion &apos;s head on the wall , with scarlet <unk> <unk> hanging round it .
I felt as if I &apos;d got into a romance , sitting there , watching the <unk> rolling through the valley , listening to the music of the <unk> band below , and waiting for my lover , like a real story-book girl .
I had a feeling that something was going to happen , and I was ready for it .
I didn &apos;t feel <unk> or <unk> , but quite cool , and only a little excited .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> to sketch the <unk> lion &apos;s head on the wall &#93; &quot; By and by I heard Fred &apos;s voice , and then he came hurrying through the great arch to find me .
He looked so troubled that I forgot all about myself , and asked what the matter was .
He said he &apos;d just got a letter begging him to come home , for Frank was very ill ; so he was going at once , in the night train , and only had time to say good-by .
I was very sorry for him , and disappointed for myself , but only for a minute , because he said , as he shook hands , --and said it in a way that I could not mistake , -- &apos; I shall soon come back ; you won &apos;t forget me , Amy ? &apos;
&quot; I didn &apos;t promise , but I looked at him , and he seemed satisfied , and there was no time for anything but messages and <unk> , for he was off in an hour , and we all miss him very much .
I know he wanted to speak , but I think , from something he once hinted , that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort yet <unk> , for he is a rash boy , and the old gentleman <unk> a foreign <unk> .
We shall soon meet in Rome ; and then , if I don &apos;t change my mind , I &apos;ll say &apos; Yes , thank you , &apos; when he says &apos; Will you , please ? &apos;
&quot; Of course this is all _ very private _ , but I wished you to know what was going on .
Don &apos;t be anxious about me ; remember I am your &apos; prudent Amy , &apos; and be sure I will do nothing <unk> .
Send me as much advice as you like ; I &apos;ll use it if I can .
I wish I could see you for a good talk , Marmee .
Love and trust me .
&quot; Ever your AMY . &quot;
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
&quot; Jo , I &apos;m anxious about Beth . &quot;
&quot; Why , mother , she has seemed unusually well since the babies came . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s not her health that troubles me now ; it &apos;s her spirits .
I &apos;m sure there is something on her mind , and I want you to discover what it is . &quot;
&quot; What makes you think so , mother ? &quot;
&quot; She sits alone a good deal , and doesn &apos;t talk to her father as much as she used .
I found her crying over the babies the other day .
When she <unk> , the songs are always sad ones , and now and then I see a look in her face that I don &apos;t understand .
This isn &apos;t like Beth , and it worries me . &quot;
&quot; Have you asked her about it ? &quot;
&quot; I have tried once or twice ; but she either <unk> my questions , or looked so distressed that I stopped .
I never force my children &apos;s confidence , and I seldom have to wait for it long . &quot;
Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke , but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret <unk> but Beth &apos;s ; and , after sewing thoughtfully for a minute , Jo said , -- &quot; I think she is growing up , and so begins to dream dreams , and have hopes and fears and fidgets , without knowing why , or being able to explain them .
Why , mother , Beth &apos;s eighteen , but we don &apos;t realize it , and treat her like a child , forgetting she &apos;s a woman . &quot;
&quot; So she is .
Dear heart , how fast you do grow up , &quot; returned her mother , with a sigh and a smile .
&quot; Can &apos;t be helped , Marmee , so you must <unk> yourself to all sorts of worries , and let your birds hop out of the nest , one by one .
I promise never to hop very far , if that is any comfort to you . &quot;
&quot; It is a great comfort , Jo ; I always feel strong when you are at home , now Meg is gone .
Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to depend upon ; but when the <unk> comes , you are always ready . &quot;
&quot; Why , you know I don &apos;t mind hard <unk> much , and there must always be one <unk> in a family .
Amy is splendid in fine works , and I &apos;m not ; but I feel in my element when all the <unk> are to be taken up , or half the family fall sick at once .
Amy is <unk> herself abroad ; but if anything is amiss at home , I &apos;m your man . &quot;
&quot; I leave Beth to your hands , then , for she will open her tender little heart to her Jo sooner than to any one else .
Be very kind , and don &apos;t let her think any one watches or talks about her .
If she only would get quite strong and cheerful again , I shouldn &apos;t have a wish in the world . &quot;
&quot; Happy woman !
I &apos;ve got heaps . &quot;
&quot; My dear , what are they ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll settle Bethy &apos;s troubles , and then I &apos;ll tell you mine .
They are not very wearing , so they &apos;ll keep ; &quot; and Jo <unk> away , with a wise nod which set her mother &apos;s heart at rest about her , for the present at least .
While apparently absorbed in her own affairs , Jo watched Beth ; and , after many <unk> <unk> , finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her .
A slight <unk> gave Jo the <unk> to the mystery , she thought , and lively fancy , loving heart did the rest .
She was <unk> to write busily one Saturday afternoon , when she and Beth were alone together ; yet as she scribbled , she kept her eye on her sister , who seemed unusually quiet .
Sitting at the window , Beth &apos;s work often dropped into her lap , and she leaned her head upon her hand , in a <unk> attitude , while her eyes rested on the dull , <unk> landscape .
<unk> some one passed below , <unk> like an <unk> <unk> , and a voice called out , -- &#91; Illustration : She leaned her head upon her hands &#93; &quot; All serene !
<unk> in to-night . &quot;
Beth started , leaned forward , smiled and nodded , watched the <unk> till his quick tramp died away , then said softly , as if to herself , -- &quot; How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks . &quot;
&quot; Hum ! &quot;
said Jo , still <unk> upon her sister &apos;s face ; for the bright color faded as quickly as it came , the smile vanished , and presently a tear lay shining on the <unk> .
Beth whisked it off , and glanced <unk> at Jo ; but she was scratching away at a tremendous rate , apparently <unk> in &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
The instant Beth turned , Jo began her watch again , saw Beth &apos;s hand go quietly to her eyes more than once , and , in her <unk> face , read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill .
<unk> to betray herself , she slipped away , murmuring something about <unk> more paper .
&quot; Mercy on me , Beth loves Laurie ! &quot;
she said , sitting down in her own room , pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made .
&quot; I never <unk> of such a thing .
What _ will _ mother say ?
I wonder if <unk> &quot; there Jo stopped , and turned scarlet with a sudden thought .
&quot; If he shouldn &apos;t love back again , how dreadful it would be .
He must ; I &apos;ll make him ! &quot;
and she shook her head <unk> at the picture of the <unk> boy laughing at her from the wall .
&quot; Oh dear , we _ are _ growing up with a <unk> .
Here &apos;s Meg married and a mamma , Amy <unk> away at Paris , and Beth in love .
I &apos;m the only one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief . &quot;
Jo thought <unk> for a minute , with her eyes fixed on the picture ; then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead , and said , with a decided nod at the face opposite , &quot; No , thank you , sir ; you &apos;re very charming , but you &apos;ve no more <unk> than a weathercock ; so you needn &apos;t write touching notes , and smile in that <unk> way , for it won &apos;t do a bit of good , and I won &apos;t have it . &quot;
Then she sighed , and fell into a reverie , from which she did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new <unk> , which only confirmed her suspicion .
Though Laurie flirted with Amy and <unk> with Jo , his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle , but so was everybody &apos;s ; therefore , no one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others .
Indeed , a general impression had prevailed in the family , of late , that &quot; our boy &quot; was getting <unk> than ever of Jo , who , however , wouldn &apos;t hear a word upon the subject , and scolded violently if any one dared to suggest it .
If they had known the various tender passages of the past year , or rather attempts at tender passages which had been <unk> in the <unk> , they would have had the immense satisfaction of saying , &quot; I told you so . &quot;
But Jo hated &quot; philandering , &quot; and wouldn &apos;t allow it , always having a joke or a smile ready at the least sign of <unk> danger .
When Laurie first went to college , he fell in love about once a month ; but these small <unk> were as brief as ardent , did no damage , and much amused Jo , who took great interest in the <unk> of hope , despair , and resignation , which were confided to her in their weekly <unk> .
But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at many <unk> , hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion , and indulged occasionally in <unk> fits of gloom .
Then he <unk> the tender subject altogether , wrote philosophical notes to Jo , turned studious , and gave out that he was going to &quot; dig , &quot; intending to <unk> in a blaze of glory .
This suited the young lady better than twilight confidences , tender <unk> of the hand , and eloquent glances of the eye ; for with Jo , brain <unk> <unk> than heart , and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones , because , when tired of them , the former could be shut up in the <unk> till called for , and the latter were less <unk> .
<unk> were in this state when the grand discovery was made , and Jo watched Laurie that night as she had never done before .
If she had not got the new idea into her head , she would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that Beth was very quiet , and Laurie very kind to her .
But having given the <unk> to her lively fancy , it <unk> away with her at a great pace ; and common sense , being rather <unk> by a long course of romance writing , did not come to the rescue .
As usual , Beth lay on the sofa , and Laurie sat in a low chair close by , amusing her with all sorts of gossip ; for she depended on her weekly &quot; <unk> , &quot; and he never disappointed her .
But that evening , Jo fancied that Beth &apos;s eyes rested on the lively , dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure , and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting <unk> , though the phrases , &quot; caught off a <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> off his ground , &quot; and &quot; the leg hit for three , &quot; were as <unk> to her as <unk> .
She also fancied , having set her heart upon seeing it , that she saw a certain increase of <unk> in Laurie &apos;s manner , that he dropped his voice now and then , laughed less than usual , was a little absent-minded , and settled the <unk> over Beth &apos;s feet with an <unk> that was really almost tender .
&quot; Who knows ?
stranger things have happened , &quot; thought Jo , as she fussed about the room .
&quot; She will make quite an angel of him , and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear , if they only love each other .
I don &apos;t see how he can help it ; and I do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way . &quot;
As every one _ was _ out of the way but herself , Jo began to feel that she ought to <unk> of herself with all speed .
But where should she go ?
and burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion , she sat down to settle that point .
Now , the old sofa was a regular <unk> of a sofa , <unk> , broad , <unk> , and low ; a trifle shabby , as well it might be , for the girls had slept and <unk> on it as babies , <unk> over the back , rode on the arms , and had <unk> under it as children , and rested tired heads , dreamed dreams , and listened to tender talk on it as young women .
They all loved it , for it was a family refuge , and one corner had always been Jo &apos;s favorite <unk> .
<unk> the many pillows that adorned the venerable <unk> was one , hard , round , covered with prickly <unk> , and furnished with a knobby button at each end ; this <unk> pillow was her especial property , being used as a <unk> of <unk> , a barricade , or a stern <unk> of too much <unk> .
Laurie knew this pillow well , and had cause to regard it with deep aversion , having been <unk> <unk> with it in former days , when romping was allowed , and now frequently <unk> by it from taking the seat he most coveted , next to Jo in the sofa corner .
If &quot; the <unk> &quot; as they called it , stood on end , it was a sign that he might <unk> and repose ; but if it lay flat across the sofa , woe to the man , woman , or child who dared disturb it !
That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner , and had not been in her seat five minutes , before a massive form appeared beside her , and , with both arms spread over the <unk> , both long legs stretched out before him , Laurie exclaimed , with a sigh of satisfaction , -- &quot; Now , _ this _ is filling at the price . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Now , this is filling at the price &#93; &quot; No slang , &quot; <unk> Jo , slamming down the pillow .
But it was too late , there was no room for it ; and , <unk> on to the floor , it disappeared in a most mysterious manner .
&quot; Come , Jo , don &apos;t be thorny .
After studying himself to a <unk> all the week , a fellow <unk> petting , and ought to get it . &quot;
&quot; Beth will pet you ; I &apos;m busy . &quot;
&quot; No , she &apos;s not to be <unk> with me ; but you like that sort of thing , unless you &apos;ve suddenly lost your taste for it .
Have you ?
Do you hate your boy , and want to fire pillows at him ? &quot;
Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard , but Jo quenched &quot; her boy &quot; by turning on him with the stern <unk> , -- &quot; How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week ? &quot;
&quot; Not one , upon my word .
She &apos;s engaged .
Now then . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad of it ; that &apos;s one of your foolish <unk> , <unk> flowers and things to girls for whom you don &apos;t care two pins , &quot; continued Jo reprovingly .
&quot; <unk> girls , for whom I do care whole papers of pins , won &apos;t let me send them &apos; flowers and things , &apos; so what can I do ?
My feelings must have a _ went _ . &quot;
&quot; Mother doesn &apos;t approve of flirting , even in fun ; and you do flirt desperately , Teddy . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d give anything if I could answer , &apos; So do you . &apos;
As I can &apos;t , I &apos;ll merely say that I don &apos;t see any harm in that pleasant little game , if all parties understand that it &apos;s only play . &quot;
&quot; Well , it does look pleasant , but I can &apos;t learn how it &apos;s done .
I &apos;ve tried , because one feels awkward in company , not to do as everybody else is doing ; but I don &apos;t seem to get on , &quot; said Jo , forgetting to play <unk> .
&quot; Take lessons of Amy ; she has a regular talent for it . &quot;
&quot; Yes , she does it very prettily , and never seems to go too far .
I suppose it &apos;s natural to some people to please without trying , and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad you can &apos;t flirt ; it &apos;s really refreshing to see a sensible , <unk> girl , who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself .
<unk> ourselves , Jo , some of the girls I know really do go on at such a rate I &apos;m ashamed of them .
They don &apos;t mean any harm , I &apos;m sure ; but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward , they &apos;d mend their ways , I fancy . &quot;
&quot; They do the same ; and , as their tongues are the <unk> , you fellows get the worst of it , for you are as silly as they , every bit .
If you behaved properly , they would ; but , knowing you like their nonsense , they keep it up , and then you blame them . &quot;
&quot; Much you know about it , ma &apos;am , &quot; said Laurie , in a superior tone .
&quot; We don &apos;t like <unk> and <unk> , though we may act as if we did sometimes .
The pretty , modest girls are never talked about , except respectfully , among gentlemen .
Bless your innocent soul !
If you could be in my place for a month you &apos;d see things that would astonish you a trifle .
Upon my word , when I see one of those harum-scarum girls , I always want to say with our friend <unk> <unk> , -- &quot; &apos; Out upon you , <unk> upon you , <unk> jig ! &apos; &quot;
It was impossible to help laughing at the funny <unk> between Laurie &apos;s <unk> <unk> to speak ill of <unk> , and his very natural <unk> of the <unk> folly of which fashionable society showed him many <unk> .
Jo knew that &quot; young Laurence &quot; was regarded as a most <unk> _ <unk> _ by worldly <unk> , was much smiled upon by their daughters , and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a <unk> of him ; so she watched him rather <unk> , fearing he would be spoilt , and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls .
<unk> suddenly to her <unk> tone , she said , dropping her voice , &quot; If you _ must _ have a &apos; went , &apos; Teddy , go and devote yourself to one of the &apos; pretty , modest girls &apos; whom you do respect , and not waste your time with the silly ones . &quot;
&quot; You really advise it ? &quot;
and Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face .
&quot; Yes , I do ; but you &apos;d better wait till you are through college , on the whole , and be fitting yourself for the place meantime .
You &apos;re not half good enough <unk> , <unk> the modest girl maybe , &quot; and Jo looked a little queer likewise , for a name had almost escaped her .
&quot; That I &apos;m not ! &quot;
<unk> Laurie , with an expression of humility quite new to him , as he dropped his eyes , and absently wound Jo &apos;s <unk> round his finger .
&quot; Mercy on us , this will never do , &quot; thought Jo ; adding aloud , &quot; Go and sing to me .
I &apos;m dying for some music , and always like yours . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d rather stay here , thank you . &quot;
&quot; Well , you can &apos;t ; there isn &apos;t room .
Go and make yourself useful , since you are too big to be <unk> .
I thought you hated to be tied to a woman &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
retorted Jo , quoting certain rebellious words of his own .
&quot; Ah , that depends on who wears the apron ! &quot;
and Laurie gave an <unk> <unk> at the <unk> .
&quot; Are you going ? &quot;
demanded Jo , <unk> for the pillow .
He fled at once , and the minute it was well &quot; Up with the bonnets of bonnie Dundee , &quot; she slipped away , to return no more till the young gentleman had departed in high <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : Up with the <unk> of <unk> Dundee &#93; Jo lay long awake that night , and was just dropping off when the sound of a <unk> sob made her fly to Beth &apos;s bedside , with the anxious inquiry , &quot; What is it , dear ? &quot;
&quot; I thought you were asleep , &quot; sobbed Beth .
&quot; Is it the old pain , my precious ? &quot;
&quot; No ; it &apos;s a new one ; but I can bear it , &quot; and Beth tried to check her tears .
&quot; Tell me all about it , and let me cure it as I often did the other . &quot;
&quot; You can &apos;t ; there is no cure . &quot;
There Beth &apos;s voice gave way , and , clinging to her sister , she cried so despairingly that Jo was frightened .
&quot; Where is it ?
Shall I call mother ? &quot;
Beth did not answer the first question ; but in the dark one hand went involuntarily to her heart , as if the pain were there ; with the other she held Jo fast , whispering eagerly , &quot; No , no , don &apos;t call her , don &apos;t tell her .
I shall be better soon .
<unk> down here and &apos; poor &apos; my head .
I &apos;ll be quiet , and go to sleep ; indeed I will . &quot;
Jo obeyed ; but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth &apos;s hot forehead and wet <unk> , her heart was very full , and she longed to speak .
But young as she was , Jo had learned that hearts , like flowers , cannot be <unk> <unk> , but must open naturally ; so , though she believed she knew the cause of Beth &apos;s new pain , she only said , in her tenderest tone , &quot; Does anything trouble you , deary ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , Jo , &quot; after a long pause .
&quot; Wouldn &apos;t it comfort you to tell me what it is ? &quot;
&quot; Not now , not yet . &quot;
&quot; Then I won &apos;t ask ; but remember , Bethy , that mother and Jo are always glad to hear and help you , if they can . &quot;
&quot; I know it .
I &apos;ll tell you by and by . &quot;
&quot; Is the pain better now ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , yes , much better ; you are so comfortable , Jo ! &quot;
&quot; Go to sleep , dear ; I &apos;ll stay with you . &quot;
So cheek to cheek they fell asleep , and on the <unk> Beth seemed quite herself again ; for at eighteen , neither heads nor hearts ache long , and a loving word can medicine most <unk> .
But Jo had made up her mind , and , after <unk> over a <unk> for some days , she confided it to her mother .
&quot; You asked me the other day what my wishes were .
I &apos;ll tell you one of them , Marmee , &quot; she began , as they sat alone together .
&quot; I want to go away somewhere this winter for a change . &quot;
&quot; Why , Jo ? &quot;
and her mother looked up quickly , as if the words suggested a double meaning .
With her eyes on her work , Jo answered soberly , &quot; I want something new ; I feel restless , and anxious to be seeing , doing , and learning more than I am .
I brood too much over my own small affairs , and need stirring up , so , as I can be spared this winter , I &apos;d like to hop a little way , and try my wings . &quot;
&quot; Where will you hop ? &quot;
&quot; To New York .
I had a bright idea yesterday , and this is it .
You know Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her children and sew .
It &apos;s rather hard to find just the thing , but I think I should suit if I tried . &quot;
&quot; My dear , go out to service in that great <unk> ! &quot;
and Mrs. March looked surprised , but not displeased .
&quot; It &apos;s not exactly going out to service ; for Mrs. Kirke is your friend , --the kindest soul that ever lived , --and would make things pleasant for me , I know .
Her family is separate from the rest , and no one knows me there .
Don &apos;t care if they do ; it &apos;s honest work , and I &apos;m not ashamed of it . &quot;
&quot; Nor I ; but your writing ? &quot;
&quot; All the better for the change .
I shall see and hear new things , get new ideas , and , even if I haven &apos;t much time there , I shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish . &quot;
&quot; I have no doubt of it ; but are these your only <unk> for this sudden fancy ? &quot;
&quot; No , mother . &quot;
&quot; May I know the others ? &quot;
Jo looked up and Jo looked down , then said slowly , with sudden color in her cheeks , &quot; It may be vain and wrong to say it , <unk> &apos;m <unk> is getting too fond of me . &quot;
&quot; Then you don &apos;t care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you ? &quot;
and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the question .
&quot; Mercy , no !
I love the dear boy , as I always have , and am immensely proud of him ; but as for anything more , it &apos;s out of the question . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad of that , Jo . &quot;
&quot; Why , please ? &quot;
&quot; Because , dear , I don &apos;t think you suited to one another .
As friends you are very happy , and your frequent quarrels soon blow over ; but I fear you would both rebel if you were <unk> for life .
You are too much alike and too fond of freedom , not to mention hot tempers and strong wills , to get on happily together , in a relation which needs infinite patience and <unk> , as well as love . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s just the feeling I had , though I couldn &apos;t express it .
I &apos;m glad you think he is only beginning to care for me .
It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy ; for I couldn &apos;t fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude , could I ? &quot;
&quot; You are sure of his feeling for you ? &quot;
The color <unk> in Jo &apos;s cheeks , as she answered , with the look of mingled pleasure , pride , and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers , -- &quot; I &apos;m afraid it is so , mother ; he hasn &apos;t said anything , but he looks a great deal .
I think I had better go away before it comes to anything . &quot;
&quot; I agree with you , and if it can be managed you shall go . &quot;
Jo looked relieved , and , after a pause , said , smiling , &quot; How Mrs. Moffat would wonder at your want of management , if she knew ; and how she will <unk> that Annie still may hope . &quot;
&quot; Ah , Jo , mothers may <unk> in their management , but the hope is the same in all , --the desire to see their children happy .
Meg is so , and I am content with her success .
You I leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it ; for only then will you find that there is something sweeter .
Amy is my chief care now , but her good sense will help her .
For Beth , I indulge no hopes except that she may be well .
By the way , she seems <unk> this last day or two .
Have you spoken to her ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; she <unk> she had a trouble , and promised to tell me by and by .
I said no more , for I think I know it ; &quot; and Jo told her little story .
Mrs. March shook her head , and did not take so romantic a view of the case , but looked grave , and repeated her opinion that , for Laurie &apos;s sake , Jo should go away for a time .
&quot; Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled ; then I &apos;ll run away before he can <unk> his wits and be tragical .
Beth must think I &apos;m going to please myself , as I am , for I can &apos;t talk about Laurie to her ; but she can pet and comfort him after I &apos;m gone , and so cure him of this romantic notion .
He &apos;s been through so many little trials of the sort , he &apos;s used to it , and will soon get over his love-lornity . &quot;
Jo spoke hopefully , but could not <unk> herself of the <unk> fear that this &quot; little trial &quot; would be harder than the others , and that Laurie would not get over his &quot; love-lornity &quot; as easily as <unk> .
The plan was talked over in a family <unk> , and agreed upon ; for Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo , and promised to make a pleasant home for her .
The teaching would render her independent ; and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing , while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable .
Jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone , for the <unk> was growing too narrow for her restless nature and <unk> spirit .
When all was settled , with fear and trembling she told Laurie ; but to her surprise he took it very quietly .
He had been <unk> than usual of late , but very pleasant ; and , when <unk> accused of turning over a new leaf , he answered soberly , &quot; So I am ; and I mean this one shall stay turned . &quot;
Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then , and made her preparations with a <unk> heart , --for Beth seemed more cheerful , --and hoped she was doing the best for all .
&quot; One thing I leave to your especial care , &quot; she said , the night before she left .
&quot; You mean your papers ? &quot;
asked Beth .
&quot; No , my boy .
Be very good to him , won &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Of course I will ; but I can &apos;t fill your place , and he &apos;ll miss you sadly . &quot;
&quot; It won &apos;t hurt him ; so remember , I leave him in your charge , to plague , pet , and keep in order . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll do my best , for your sake , &quot; promised Beth , wondering why Jo looked at her so <unk> .
When Laurie said &quot; Good-by , &quot; he whispered <unk> , &quot; It won &apos;t do a bit of good , Jo .
My eye is on you ; so mind what you do , or I &apos;ll come and bring you home . &quot;

JO &apos;S <unk> .
&quot; NEW <unk> , November .
&quot; DEAR <unk> AND BETH , -- &quot; I &apos;m going to write you a regular volume , for I &apos;ve got heaps to tell , though I &apos;m not a fine young lady travelling on the <unk> .
When I lost sight of father &apos;s dear old face , I felt a trifle blue , and might have shed a <unk> drop or two , if an Irish lady with four small children , all crying more or less , hadn &apos;t diverted my mind ; for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to <unk> .
&quot; Soon the sun came out , and taking it as a good omen , I cleared up likewise , and enjoyed my journey with all my heart .
&quot; Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once , even in that big house full of strangers .
She gave me a funny little <unk> she had ; but there is a stove in it , and a nice table in a sunny window , so I can sit here and write whenever I like .
A fine view and a <unk> opposite atone for the many stairs , and I took a fancy to my den on the spot .
The nursery , where I am to teach and sew , is a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke &apos;s private parlor , and the two little girls are pretty children , --rather spoilt , I fancy , but they took to me after telling them &apos; The Seven <unk> <unk> ; &apos; and I &apos;ve no doubt I shall make a model governess .
&quot; I am to have my meals with the children , if I prefer it to the great table , and for the present I do , for I _ am _ bashful , though no one will believe it .
&quot; &apos; Now , my dear , make yourself at home , &apos; said Mrs. K. in her motherly way ; &apos; I &apos;m on the drive from morning to night , as you may suppose with such a family ; but a great anxiety will be off my mind if I know the children are safe with you .
My rooms are always open to you , and your own shall be as comfortable as I can make it .
There are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable , and your evenings are always free .
Come to me if anything goes wrong , and be as happy as you can .
There &apos;s the tea-bell ; I must run and change my cap ; &apos; and off she <unk> , leaving me to settle myself in my new nest .
&quot; As I went downstairs , soon after , I saw something I liked .
The <unk> are very long in this tall house , and as I stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to <unk> up , I saw a gentleman come along behind her , take the heavy <unk> of <unk> out of her hand , carry it all the way up , put it down at a door near by , and walk away , saying , with a kind nod and a foreign accent , -- &quot; &apos; It goes better so .
The little back is too young to haf such <unk> . &apos;
&quot; Wasn &apos;t it good of him ?
I like such things , for , as father says , trifles show character .
When I mentioned it to Mrs. K. , that evening , she laughed , and said , -- &quot; &apos; That must have been Professor Bhaer ; he &apos;s always doing things of that sort . &apos;
&quot; Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin ; very learned and good , but poor as a <unk> , and gives lessons to support himself and two little <unk> <unk> whom he is <unk> here , according to the wishes of his sister , who married an American .
Not a very romantic story , but it interested me ; and I was glad to hear that Mrs. K. <unk> him her parlor for some of his <unk> .
There is a glass door between it and the nursery , and I mean to peep at him , and then I &apos;ll tell you how he looks .
He &apos;s almost forty , so it &apos;s no harm , Marmee .
&quot; After tea and a <unk> <unk> with the little girls , I <unk> the big work-basket , and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend .
I shall keep a <unk> , and send it once a week ; so good-night , and more to-morrow . &quot;
&quot; _ Tuesday Eve . _ &quot; <unk> a lively time in my <unk> , this morning , for the children acted like Sancho ; and at one time I really thought I should shake them all round .
Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics , and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still .
After luncheon , the girl took them out for a walk , and I went to my needle-work , like little <unk> , &apos; with a willing mind . &apos;
I was <unk> my stars that I &apos;d learned to make nice button-holes , when the <unk> opened and shut , and some one began to hum , -- &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> land , &apos; like a big <unk> .
It was dreadfully improper , I know , but I couldn &apos;t resist the temptation ; and <unk> one end of the curtain before the glass door , I peeped in .
Professor Bhaer was there ; and while he arranged his books , I took a good look at him .
A regular German , --rather stout , with brown hair tumbled all over his head , a bushy beard , good nose , the kindest eyes I ever saw , and a splendid big voice that does one &apos;s ears good , after our sharp or <unk> American <unk> .
His clothes were <unk> , his hands were large , and he hadn &apos;t a really handsome feature in his face , except his beautiful teeth ; yet I liked him , for he had a fine head ; his linen was very nice , and he looked like a gentleman , though two buttons were off his coat , and there was a <unk> on one shoe .
He looked sober in spite of his humming , till he went to the window to turn the <unk> <unk> toward the sun , and stroke the cat , who received him like an old friend .
Then he smiled ; and when a tap came at the door , called out in a loud , brisk tone , -- &quot; &apos; <unk> ! &apos;
&quot; I was just going to run , when I caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book , and stopped to see what was going on .
&quot; &apos; Me wants my Bhaer , &apos; said the mite , slamming down her book , and running to meet him .
&quot; &apos; Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer ; come , then , and take a <unk> hug from him , my Tina , &apos; said the Professor , catching her up , with a laugh , and holding her so high over his head that she had to <unk> her little face to kiss him .
&#91; Illustration : Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer &#93; &quot; &apos; Now me <unk> <unk> my <unk> , &apos; went on the funny little thing ; so he put her up at the table , opened the great <unk> she had brought , and gave her a paper and pencil , and she scribbled away , turning a leaf now and then , and passing her little fat finger down the page , as if finding a word , so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh , while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair , with a fatherly look , that made me think she must be his own , though she looked more French than German .
&quot; Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work , and there I <unk> remained through all the <unk> and <unk> that went on next door .
One of the girls kept laughing <unk> , and saying &apos; Now Professor , &apos; in a coquettish tone , and the other pronounced her German with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober .
&quot; Both seemed to try his patience sorely ; for more than once I heard him say <unk> , &apos; No , no , it is _ not _ so ; you haf not attend to what I say ; &apos; and once there was a loud rap , as if he struck the table with his book , followed by the despairing exclamation , &apos; Prut !
it all goes bad this day . &apos;
&quot; Poor man , I pitied him ; and when the girls were gone , took just one more peep , to see if he <unk> it .
He seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair , tired out , and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two , when he jumped up , put his books in his pocket , as if ready for another lesson , and , taking little Tina , who had fallen asleep on the sofa , in his arms , he carried her quietly away .
I fancy he has a hard life of it .
&quot; Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn &apos;t go down to the five o &apos;clock dinner ; and , feeling a little bit homesick , I thought I would , just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me .
So I made myself respectable , and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke ; but as she is short , and I &apos;m tall , my efforts at <unk> were rather a failure .
She gave me a seat by her , and after my face cooled off , I plucked up courage , and looked about me .
The long table was full , and every one <unk> on getting their dinner , --the gentlemen especially , who seemed to be eating on time , for they _ bolted _ in every sense of the word , <unk> as soon as they were done .
There was the usual <unk> of young men absorbed in themselves ; young couples absorbed in each other ; married ladies in their babies , and old gentlemen in politics .
I don &apos;t think I shall care to have much to do with any of them , except one <unk> maiden lady , who looks as if she had something in her .
&quot; <unk> away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor , <unk> answers to the questions of a very inquisitive , deaf old gentleman on one side , and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other .
If Amy had been here , she &apos;d have turned her back on him forever , because , sad to <unk> , he had a great appetite , and <unk> in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified &apos; her ladyship . &apos;
I didn &apos;t mind , for I like &apos; to see folks eat with a relish , &apos; as Hannah says , and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching <unk> all day .
&quot; As I went upstairs after dinner , two of the young men were settling their hats before the <unk> , and I heard one say low to the other , &apos; Who &apos;s the new party ? &apos;
&quot; &apos; <unk> , or something of that sort . &apos;
&quot; &apos; What the deuce is she at our table for ? &apos;
&quot; &apos; Friend of the old lady &apos;s . &apos;
&quot; &apos; <unk> head , but no style . &apos;
&quot; &apos; Not a bit of it .
Give us a light and come on . &apos;
&quot; I felt angry at first , and then I didn &apos;t care , for a governess is as good as a <unk> , and I &apos;ve got sense , if I haven &apos;t style , which is more than some people have , judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who <unk> away , <unk> like bad <unk> .
I hate ordinary people ! &quot;
&quot; _ Thursday . _ &quot; Yesterday was a quiet day , spent in teaching , sewing , and writing in my little room , which is very cosey , with a light and fire .
I picked up a few bits of news , and was introduced to the Professor .
It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine <unk> in the <unk> here .
The little thing has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer , and <unk> him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home , which delights him , as he is very fond of children , though a &apos; <unk> . &apos;
Kitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard him with affection , and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he <unk> , the presents he brings , and the splendid tales he tells .
The young men <unk> him , it seems , call him Old Fritz , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Major , and make all manner of jokes on his name .
But he <unk> it like a boy , Mrs. K. says , and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him , in spite of his foreign ways .
&quot; The maiden lady is a Miss Norton , <unk> , cultivated , and kind .
She spoke to me at dinner to-day ( for I went to table again , it &apos;s such fun to watch people ) , and asked me to come and see her at her room .
She has fine books and pictures , knows interesting persons , and seems friendly ; so I shall make myself agreeable , for I _ do _ want to get into good society , only it isn &apos;t the same sort that Amy likes .
&quot; I was in our parlor last evening , when Mr. Bhaer came in with some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke .
She wasn &apos;t there , but Minnie , who is a little old woman , introduced me very prettily : &apos; This is mamma &apos;s friend , Miss March . &apos;
&quot; &apos; Yes ; and she &apos;s jolly and we like her lots , &apos; added Kitty , who is an _ <unk> <unk> _ .
&quot; We both bowed , and then we laughed , for the prim <unk> and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast .
&quot; &apos; Ah , yes , I hear these naughty ones go to <unk> you , Mees Marsch .
If so again , call at me and I come , &apos; he said , with a threatening frown that delighted the little <unk> .
&quot; I promised I would , and he departed ; but it seems as if I was <unk> to see a good deal of him , for to-day , as I passed his door on my way out , by accident I knocked against it with my umbrella .
It flew open , and there he stood in his dressing gown , with a big blue sock on one hand , and a <unk> in the other ; he didn &apos;t seem at all ashamed of it , for when I explained and hurried on , he waved his hand , sock and all , saying in his loud , cheerful way , -- &#91; Illustration : He waved his hand , sock and all &#93; &quot; &apos; You haf a fine day to make your walk .
_ <unk> voyage , mademoiselle . _ &apos; &quot; I laughed all the way downstairs ; but it was a little pathetic , also , to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes .
The German gentlemen <unk> , I know ; but <unk> <unk> is another thing , and not so pretty . &quot;
&quot; _ Saturday . _ &quot; Nothing has happened to write about , except a call on Miss Norton , who has a room full of lovely things , and who was very charming , for she showed me all her treasures , and asked me if I would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts , as her escort , <unk> I enjoyed them .
She put it as a favor , but I &apos;m sure Mrs. Kirke has told her about us , and she does it out of kindness to me .
I &apos;m as proud as <unk> , but such favors from such people don &apos;t burden me , and I accepted gratefully .
&quot; When I got back to the nursery there was such an <unk> in the parlor that I looked in ; and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his hands and knees , with Tina on his back , Kitty leading him with a <unk> , and Minnie feeding two small boys with <unk> , as they <unk> and <unk> in <unk> built of chairs .
&quot; &apos; We are playing _ <unk> _ , &apos; explained Kitty .
&quot; &apos; Dis is mine effalunt ! &apos;
added Tina , holding on by the Professor &apos;s hair .
&#91; Illustration : Dis is mine effalunt &#93; &quot; &apos; Mamma always <unk> us to do what we like Saturday afternoon , when Franz and Emil come , doesn &apos;t she , Mr.
Bhaer ? &apos;
said Minnie .
&quot; The &apos; effalunt &apos; sat up , looking as much in earnest as any of them , and said soberly to me , -- &quot; &apos; I gif you my <unk> it is so .
If we make too large a <unk> you shall say &quot; Hush ! &quot;
to us , and we go more softly . &apos;
&quot; I promised to do so , but left the door open , and enjoyed the fun as much as they did , --for a more glorious frolic I never <unk> .
They played <unk> and soldiers , danced and sung , and when it began to grow dark they all piled on to the sofa about the Professor , while he told charming fairy stories of the <unk> on the <unk> , and the little &apos; <unk> , &apos; who ride the <unk> as they fall .
I wish Americans were as simple and natural as Germans , don &apos;t you ?
&quot; I &apos;m so fond of writing , I should go spinning on forever if <unk> of <unk> didn &apos;t stop me , for though I &apos;ve used thin paper and written fine , I <unk> to think of the <unk> this long letter will need .
Pray forward Amy &apos;s as soon as you can spare them .
My small news will sound very flat after her <unk> , but you will like them , I know .
Is Teddy studying so hard that he can &apos;t find time to write to his friends ?
Take good care of him for me , Beth , and tell me all about the babies , and give heaps of love to every one .
&quot; From your faithful JO .
&quot; P. S. On reading over my letter it <unk> me as rather <unk> ; but I am always interested in odd people , and I really had nothing else to write about .
Bless you ! &quot;
&quot; <unk> .
&quot; MY <unk> <unk> , -- &quot; As this is to be a <unk> letter , I <unk> it to you , for it may amuse you , and give you some idea of my <unk> on ; for , though quiet , they are rather amusing , for which , oh , be joyful !
After what Amy would call <unk> efforts , in the way of mental and moral <unk> , my young ideas begin to <unk> and my little <unk> to bend as I could wish .
They are not so interesting to me as Tina and the boys , but I do my duty by them , and they are fond of me .
Franz and Emil are jolly little lads , quite after my own heart ; for the mixture of German and American spirit in them <unk> a constant state of <unk> .
Saturday afternoons are riotous times , whether spent in the house or out ; for on pleasant days they all go to walk , like a <unk> , with the Professor and myself to keep order ; and then such fun !
&quot; We are very good friends now , and I &apos;ve begun to take lessons .
I really couldn &apos;t help it , and it all came about in such a droll way that I must tell you .
To begin at the beginning , Mrs. Kirke called to me , one day , as I passed Mr. Bhaer &apos;s room , where she was rummaging .
&quot; &apos; Did you ever see such a den , my dear ?
Just come and help me put these books to rights , for I &apos;ve turned everything upside down , trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago . &apos;
&quot; I went in , and while we worked I looked about me , for it was &apos; a den , &apos; to be sure .
<unk> and papers everywhere ; a broken <unk> , and an old <unk> over the mantel-piece as if done with ; a ragged bird , without any tail , chirped on one <unk> , and a box of white mice adorned the other ; half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts ; dirty little boots stood drying before the fire ; and <unk> of the dearly beloved boys , for whom he makes a slave of himself , were to be seen all over the room .
After a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found , --one over the <unk> , one covered with ink , and a third burnt brown , having been used as a holder .
&quot; &apos; Such a man ! &apos;
laughed good-natured Mrs. K. , as she put the relics in the rag-bag .
&apos;I suppose the others are torn up to <unk> ships , <unk> cut fingers , or make <unk> .
It &apos;s dreadful , but I can &apos;t scold him : he &apos;s so absent-minded and good-natured , he lets those boys ride over him <unk> .
I agreed to do his washing and mending , but he forgets to give out his things and I forget to look them over , so he comes to a sad pass sometimes . &apos;
&quot; &apos; Let me mend them , &apos; said I.
&apos;I don &apos;t mind it , and he needn &apos;t know .
I &apos;d like to , <unk> &apos;s so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books . &apos;
&quot; So I have got his things in order , and knit heels into two pairs of the socks , --for they were <unk> out of shape with his queer <unk> .
Nothing was said , and I hoped he wouldn &apos;t find it out , but one day last week he caught me at it .
Hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that I took a fancy to learn ; for Tina runs in and out , leaving the door open , and I can hear .
I had been sitting near this door , finishing off the last sock , and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar , who is as stupid as I am .
The girl had gone , and I thought he had also , it was so still , and I was busily <unk> over a <unk> , and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way , when a little crow made me look up , and there was Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly , while he made signs to Tina not to betray him .
&quot; &apos; So ! &apos;
he said , as I stopped and stared like a goose , &apos; you peep at me , I peep at you , and that is not bad ; but see , I am not <unk> when I say , haf you a wish for German ? &apos;
&quot; &apos; Yes ; but you are too busy .
I am too stupid to learn , &apos; I blundered out , as red as a <unk> .
&quot; &apos; Prut !
we will make the time , and we fail not to find the sense .
At <unk> I shall gif a little lesson with much <unk> ; for , look you , Mees Marsch , I haf this debt to pay , &apos; and he pointed to my work .
<unk> , they say to one another , these so kind ladies , &quot; he is a stupid old fellow ; he will see not what we do ; he will never <unk> that his <unk> go not in <unk> any more , he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall , and believe that strings make <unk> . &quot;
Ah !
but I haf an eye , and I see much .
I haf a heart , and I feel the thanks for this .
Come , a little lesson then and now , or no more good fairy works for me and mine . &apos;
&quot; Of course I couldn &apos;t say anything after that , and as it really is a splendid opportunity , I made the bargain , and we began .
I took four lessons , and then I stuck fast in a <unk> <unk> .
The Professor was very patient with me , but it must have been torment to him , and now and then he &apos;d look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a <unk> with me whether to laugh or cry .
I tried both ways ; and when it came to a sniff of utter mortification and woe , he just threw the grammar on to the floor , and marched out of the room .
I felt myself disgraced and deserted forever , but didn &apos;t blame him a particle , and was <unk> my papers together , meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard , when in he came , as brisk and beaming as if I &apos;d covered myself with glory .
&quot; &apos; Now we shall try a new way .
You and I will read these pleasant little <unk> ? <unk> together , and dig no more in that dry book , that goes in the corner for making us trouble . &apos;
&quot; He spoke so kindly , and opened <unk> <unk> &apos;s fairy tales so invitingly before me , that I was more ashamed than ever , and went at my lesson in a <unk> style that seemed to amuse him immensely .
I forgot my bashfulness , and <unk> away ( no other word will express it ) with all my might , tumbling over long words , <unk> according to the inspiration of the minute , and doing my very best .
When I finished reading my first page , and stopped for breath , he clapped his hands and cried out , in his hearty way , &apos; <unk> ist <unk> !
Now we go well !
My turn .
I do him in German ; gif me your ear . &apos;
And away he went , <unk> out the words with his strong voice , and a relish which was good to see as well as hear .
Fortunately the story was the &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &apos; which is droll , you know , so I could laugh , --and I did , <unk> I didn &apos;t understand half he read , for I couldn &apos;t help it , he was so earnest , I so excited , and the whole thing so comical .
&quot; After that we got on better , and now I read my lessons pretty well ; for this way of studying suits me , and I can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives <unk> in jelly .
I like it very much , and he doesn &apos;t seem tired of it yet , <unk> is very good of him , isn &apos;t it ?
I mean to give him something on Christmas , for I dare not offer money .
Tell me something nice , Marmee .
&quot; I &apos;m glad Laurie seems so happy and busy , that he has given up <unk> , and lets his hair grow .
You see Beth <unk> him better than I did .
I &apos;m not jealous , dear ; do your best , only don &apos;t make a saint of him .
I &apos;m afraid I couldn &apos;t like him without a spice of human <unk> .
Read him bits of my letters .
I haven &apos;t time to write much , and that will do just as well .
Thank <unk> Beth <unk> so comfortable . &quot;
&quot; <unk> .
&quot; A Happy New Year to you all , my dearest family , which of course <unk> Mr. L. and a young man by the name of Teddy .
I can &apos;t tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle , for I didn &apos;t get it till night , and had given up hoping .
Your letter came in the morning , but you said nothing about a parcel , meaning it for a surprise ; so I was disappointed , for I &apos;d had a &apos; kind of a feeling &apos; that you wouldn &apos;t forget me .
I felt a little low in my mind , as I sat up in my room , after tea ; and when the big , muddy , <unk> bundle was brought to me , I just hugged it , and pranced .
It was so _ <unk> _ and refreshing , that I sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried , in my usual absurd way .
The things were just what I wanted , and all the better for being made instead of bought .
Beth &apos;s new &apos; <unk> &apos; was capital ; and Hannah &apos;s box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure .
I &apos;ll be sure and wear the nice <unk> you sent , Marmee , and read carefully the books father has marked .
Thank you all , heaps and heaps !
&#91; Illustration : I sat down upon the floor and read and looked and ate &#93; &quot; <unk> of books reminds me that I &apos;m getting rich in that line for , on New Year &apos;s Day , Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare .
It is one he <unk> much , and I &apos;ve often admired it , set up in the place of honor , with his German <unk> , Plato , <unk> , and <unk> ; so you may imagine how I felt when he brought it down , without its cover , and showed me my name in it , &apos; from my friend Friedrich Bhaer . &apos;
&quot; &apos; You say often you wish a library : here I gif you one ; for between these <unk> ( he meant covers ) is many books in one .
Read him well , and he will help you much ; for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen . &apos;
&quot; I thanked him as well as I could , and talk now about &apos; my library , &apos; as if I had a hundred books .
I never knew how much there was in Shakespeare before ; but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to me .
Now _ don &apos;t _ laugh at his horrid name ; it isn &apos;t pronounced either <unk> or <unk> , as people _ will _ say it , but something between the two , as only Germans can give it .
I &apos;m glad you both like what I tell you about him , and hope you will know him some day .
Mother would admire his warm heart , father his wise head .
I admire both , and feel rich in my new &apos; friend Friedrich Bhaer . &apos;
&quot; Not having much money , or knowing what he &apos;d like , I got several little things , and put them about the room , where he would find them unexpectedly .
They were useful , pretty , or funny , --a new <unk> on his table , a little vase for his flower , <unk> always has one , or a bit of green in a glass , to keep him fresh , he says , --and a holder for his <unk> , so that he needn &apos;t burn up what Amy calls &apos; <unk> . &apos;
I made it like those Beth invented , --a big <unk> with a fat body , and black and yellow wings , worsted <unk> , and <unk> eyes .
It took his fancy immensely , and he put it on his mantel-piece as an article of _ <unk> _ ; so it was rather a failure after all .
Poor as he is , he didn &apos;t forget a servant or a child in the house ; and not a soul here , from the French <unk> to Miss Norton , forgot him .
I was so glad of that .
&quot; They got up a masquerade , and had a gay time New Year &apos;s Eve .
I didn &apos;t mean to go down , having no dress ; but at the last minute , Mrs. Kirke remembered some old <unk> , and Miss Norton lent me lace and feathers ; so I dressed up as Mrs. <unk> , and sailed in with a mask on .
No one knew me , for I <unk> my voice , and no one dreamed of the silent , haughty Miss March ( for they think I am very stiff and cool , most of them ; and so I am to <unk> ) could dance and dress , and burst out into a &apos; nice <unk> of <unk> , like an <unk> on the banks of the <unk> . &apos;
I enjoyed it very much ; and when we <unk> , it was fun to see them stare at me .
I heard one of the young men tell another that he knew I &apos;d been an <unk> ; in fact , he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the <unk> theatres .
Meg will relish that joke .
Mr. Bhaer was <unk> <unk> , and Tina was <unk> , --a perfect little fairy in his arms .
To see them dance was &apos; quite a landscape , &apos; to use a <unk> .
&quot; I had a very happy New Year , after all ; and when I thought it over in my room , I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite of my many failures ; for I &apos;m cheerful all the time now , work with a will , and take more interest in other people than I used to , which is satisfactory .
Bless you all !
Ever your loving JO . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : In the presence of three gentlemen &#93; <unk> .
A <unk> .
Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her , and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread , and made it sweeter for the effort , Jo still found time for literary labors .
The purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl ; but the means she took to gain her end were not the best .
She saw that money conferred power : money and power , therefore , she resolved to have ; not to be used for herself alone , but for those whom she loved more than self .
The dream of filling home with comforts , giving Beth everything she wanted , from strawberries in winter to an <unk> in her <unk> ; going abroad herself , and always having _ more _ than enough , so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity , had been for years Jo &apos;s most cherished castle in the air .
The <unk> experience had seemed to open a way which might , after long travelling and much <unk> work lead to this delightful _ ch ? <unk> en <unk> _ .
But the novel <unk> quenched her courage for a time , for public opinion is a giant which has frightened <unk> <unk> on bigger <unk> than hers .
Like that immortal hero , she reposed <unk> after the first attempt , which <unk> in a tumble , and the least lovely of the giant &apos;s treasures , if I remember rightly .
But the &quot; up again and take another &quot; spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack ; so she scrambled up , on the shady side this time , and got more <unk> , but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the <unk> .
She took to writing sensation stories ; for in those dark ages , even <unk> America read rubbish .
She told no one , but <unk> a &quot; thrilling tale , &quot; and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood , editor of the &quot; Weekly Volcano . &quot;
She had never read &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more <unk> over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners .
So she dressed herself in her best , and , trying to <unk> herself that she was neither excited nor nervous , bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a <unk> room , a cloud of <unk> , and the presence of three gentlemen , sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats , which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance .
<unk> daunted by this reception , Jo <unk> on the threshold , murmuring in much <unk> , -- &quot; Excuse me , I was looking for the &apos; Weekly Volcano &apos; office ; I wished to see Mr.
Dashwood . &quot;
Down went the highest pair of heels , up rose the <unk> gentleman , and , carefully <unk> his cigar between his fingers , he <unk> , with a nod , and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep .
Feeling that she must get through the matter somehow , Jo produced her manuscript , and , blushing redder and redder with each sentence , blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion .
&quot; A friend of mine desired me to <unk> <unk> as an <unk> like your <unk> glad to write more if this suits . &quot;
While she blushed and blundered , Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript , and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers , and <unk> critical glances up and down the neat pages .
&quot; Not a first attempt , I take it ? &quot;
observing that the pages were <unk> , covered only on one side , and not tied up with a ribbon , <unk> sign of a <unk> .
&quot; No , sir ; she has had some experience , and got a prize for a tale in the &apos; <unk> <unk> . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Oh , did she ? &quot;
and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look , which seemed to take note of everything she had on , from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots .
&quot; Well , you can leave it , if you like .
We &apos;ve more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present ; but I &apos;ll run my eye over it , and give you an answer next week . &quot;
Now , Jo did _ not _ like to leave it , for Mr. Dashwood didn &apos;t suit her at all ; but , under the circumstances , there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away , looking particularly tall and dignified , as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed .
Just then she was both ; for it was perfectly evident , from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen , that her little <unk> of &quot; my friend &quot; was considered a good joke ; and a laugh , produced by some <unk> remark of the editor , as he closed the door , <unk> her <unk> .
Half resolving never to return , she went home , and worked off her <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> ; and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene , and long for next week .
When she went again , Mr. Dashwood was alone , <unk> she rejoiced ; Mr. Dashwood was much <unk> awake than before , which was agreeable ; and Mr. Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners : so the second <unk> was much more comfortable than the first .
&quot; We &apos;ll take this &quot; ( <unk> never say I ) , &quot; if you don &apos;t object to a few <unk> .
It &apos;s too long , but <unk> the passages I &apos;ve marked will make it just the right length , &quot; he said , in a <unk> tone .
Jo hardly knew her own <unk> again , so crumpled and <unk> were its pages and paragraphs ; but , feeling as a tender parent might on being asked to cut off her baby &apos;s legs in order that it might fit into a new <unk> , she looked at the marked passages , and was surprised to find that all the moral <unk> she had carefully put in as <unk> for much <unk> been stricken out .
&quot; But , sir , I thought every story should have some sort of a moral , so I took care to have a few of my sinners <unk> . &quot;
Mr. Dashwood &apos;s <unk> gravity relaxed into a smile , for Jo had forgotten her &quot; friend , &quot; and spoken as only an author could .
&quot; People want to be amused , not preached at , you know .
<unk> don &apos;t sell <unk> ; &quot; which was not quite a correct <unk> , by the way .
&quot; You think it would do with these <unk> , then ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; it &apos;s a new plot , and pretty well worked <unk> good , and so on , &quot; was Mr. Dashwood &apos;s <unk> reply .
&quot; What do <unk> is , what <unk> &quot; began Jo , not exactly knowing how to express herself .
&quot; Oh , yes , well , we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this sort .
<unk> when it comes out , &quot; returned Mr. Dashwood , as if that point had escaped him ; such trifles often do escape the <unk> mind , it is said .
&quot; Very well ; you can have it , &quot; said Jo , handing back the story , with a satisfied air ; for , after the <unk> work , even twenty-five seemed good pay .
&quot; Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this ? &quot;
asked Jo , unconscious of her little slip of the tongue , and <unk> by her success .
&quot; Well , we &apos;ll look at it ; can &apos;t promise to take it .
Tell her to make it short and <unk> , and never mind the moral .
What name would your friend like to put to it ? &quot;
in a careless tone .
&quot; None at all , if you please ; she doesn &apos;t wish her name to appear , and has no _ <unk> de <unk> _ , &quot; said Jo , blushing in spite of herself .
&quot; Just as she likes , of course .
The tale will be out next week ; will you call for the money , or shall I send it ? &quot;
asked Mr. Dashwood , who felt a natural desire to know who his new <unk> might be .
&quot; I &apos;ll call .
Good morning , sir . &quot;
As she departed , Mr. Dashwood put up his feet , with the graceful remark , &quot; Poor and proud , as usual , but she &apos;ll do . &quot;
<unk> Mr. Dashwood &apos;s directions , and making Mrs. <unk> her model , Jo <unk> took a <unk> into the <unk> sea of sensational literature ; but , thanks to the <unk> thrown her by a friend , she came up again , not much the worse for her <unk> .
Like most young <unk> , she went abroad for her characters and scenery ; and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> appeared upon her stage , and played their parts with as much <unk> and spirit as could be expected .
Her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar , punctuation , and <unk> , and Mr. Dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his <unk> , on being offered higher <unk> , had basely left him in the <unk> .
She soon became interested in her work , for her <unk> purse grew stout , and the little <unk> she was making to take Beth to the <unk> next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed .
One thing disturbed her satisfaction , and that was that she did not tell them at home .
She had a feeling that father and mother would not approve , and preferred to have her own way first , and beg pardon afterward .
It was easy to keep her secret , for no name appeared with her stories ; Mr. Dashwood had , of course , found it out very soon , but promised to be dumb ; and , for a wonder , kept his word .
She thought it would do her no harm , for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she should be ashamed , and quieted all <unk> of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret .
But Mr. Dashwood <unk> any but thrilling tales ; and , as <unk> could not be produced except by <unk> up the souls of the readers , history and romance , land and sea , <unk> and art , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , had to be <unk> for the purpose .
Jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which <unk> society ; so , regarding it in a business light , she set about <unk> her <unk> with characteristic energy .
<unk> to find material for stories , and bent on making them original in plot , if not <unk> in <unk> , she <unk> newspapers for accidents , <unk> , and <unk> ; she excited the suspicions of public <unk> by asking for works on <unk> ; she studied faces in the street , and characters , good , bad , and indifferent , all about her ; she <unk> in the dust of ancient times for facts or <unk> so old that they were as good as new , and introduced herself to folly , sin , and misery , as well as her limited opportunities allowed .
She thought she was <unk> finely ; but , unconsciously , she was beginning to <unk> some of the <unk> <unk> of a woman &apos;s character .
She was living in bad society ; and , imaginary though it was , its influence affected her , for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and <unk> food , and was fast <unk> the innocent bloom from her nature by a <unk> acquaintance with the <unk> side of life , which comes soon enough to all of us .
She was beginning to feel rather than see this , for much <unk> of other people &apos;s passions and feelings set her to studying and <unk> about her own , --a <unk> amusement , in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge .
<unk> always brings its own punishment ; and , when Jo most needed hers , she got it .
I don &apos;t know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read character , or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest , brave , and strong ; but while <unk> her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun , Jo was <unk> a live hero , who interested her in spite of many human <unk> .
Mr. Bhaer , in one of their conversations , had advised her to study simple , true , and lovely characters , wherever she found them , as good training for a writer .
Jo took him at his word , for she <unk> turned round and studied him , --a proceeding which would have much surprised him , had he known it , for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own <unk> .
Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo , at first .
He was neither rich nor great , young nor handsome ; in no respect what is called fascinating , <unk> , or brilliant ; and yet he was as attractive as a <unk> fire , and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth .
He was poor , yet always appeared to be giving something away ; a stranger , yet every one was his friend ; no longer young , but as happy-hearted as a boy ; plain and peculiar , yet his face looked beautiful to many , and his <unk> were freely forgiven for his sake .
Jo often watched him , trying to discover the charm , and , at last , decided that it was <unk> which worked the miracle .
If he had any sorrow , &quot; it sat with its head under its <unk> , &quot; and he turned only his sunny side to the world .
There were lines upon his forehead , but Time seemed to have touched him gently , remembering how kind he was to others .
The pleasant <unk> about his mouth were the <unk> of many friendly words and cheery <unk> ; his eyes were never cold or hard , and his big hand had a warm , strong grasp that was more expressive than words .
His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the <unk> .
They looked as if they were at ease , and liked to make him comfortable ; his <unk> waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart <unk> ; his <unk> coat had a social air , and the <unk> pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full ; his very boots were <unk> , and his collars never stiff and <unk> like other people &apos;s .
&quot; That &apos;s it ! &quot;
said Jo to herself , when she at length discovered that genuine good-will towards one &apos;s <unk> could <unk> and <unk> even a stout German teacher , who <unk> in his dinner , <unk> his own socks , and was <unk> with the name of Bhaer .
Jo valued goodness highly , but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect , and a little discovery which she made about the Professor added much to her regard for him .
He never spoke of himself , and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and <unk> for learning and <unk> , till a <unk> came to see him , and , in a conversation with Miss Norton , <unk> the pleasing fact .
From her Jo learned it , and liked it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it .
She felt proud to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin , though only a poor <unk> in America ; and his homely , <unk> life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it .
Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner .
Miss Norton had the _ <unk> ? e _ into literary society , which Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her .
The solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl , and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor .
She took them with her , one night , to a select symposium , held in honor of several <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : A select symposium &#93; Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had <unk> with youthful enthusiasm <unk> off .
But her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night , and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all .
<unk> her dismay , on <unk> a glance of timid admiration at the <unk> whose lines suggested an <unk> being fed on &quot; spirit , fire , and dew , &quot; to behold him <unk> his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance .
Turning as from a fallen idol , she made other discoveries which rapidly <unk> her romantic <unk> .
The great <unk> <unk> between two <unk> with the regularity of a <unk> ; the famous divine flirted openly with one of the Madame de <unk> ? <unk> of the age , who looked <unk> at another <unk> , who was <unk> <unk> her , after <unk> ? <unk> her in efforts to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , who <unk> tea <unk> and appeared to <unk> , the <unk> of the lady <unk> speech impossible .
The <unk> <unk> , forgetting their <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> about art , while devoting themselves to <unk> and <unk> with characteristic energy ; the young musician , who was charming the city like a second <unk> , talked horses ; and the <unk> of the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party .
Before the evening was half over , Jo felt so <unk> _ d ? <unk> ? e _ , that she sat down in a corner to recover herself .
Mr. Bhaer soon joined her , looking rather out of his element , and presently several of the <unk> , each mounted on his <unk> , came <unk> up to hold an intellectual <unk> in the recess .
The conversation was miles beyond Jo &apos;s <unk> , but she enjoyed it , though <unk> and <unk> were unknown gods , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> terms ; and the only thing &quot; <unk> from her <unk> consciousness , &quot; was a bad headache after it was all over .
It <unk> upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces , and put together on new , and , according to the <unk> , on infinitely better <unk> than before ; that religion was in a fair way to be <unk> into <unk> , and intellect was to be the only God .
Jo knew nothing about philosophy or <unk> of any sort , but a curious excitement , half <unk> , half painful , came over her , as she listened with a sense of being turned <unk> into time and <unk> , like a young <unk> out on a holiday .
She looked round to see how the Professor liked it , and found him looking at her with the <unk> expression she had ever seen him wear .
He shook his head , and beckoned her to come away ; but she was <unk> , just then , by the freedom of <unk> <unk> , and kept her seat , trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to <unk> upon after they had <unk> all the old beliefs .
Now , Mr. Bhaer was a <unk> man , and slow to offer his own <unk> , not because they were unsettled , but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken .
As he glanced from Jo to several other young people , attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic <unk> , he knit his brows , and longed to speak , fearing that some <unk> young soul would be led <unk> by the <unk> , to find , when the display was over , that they had only an empty <unk> or a scorched hand .
He bore it as long as he could ; but when he was <unk> to for an opinion , he <unk> up with honest indignation , and defended religion with all the eloquence of truth , <unk> eloquence which made his broken English musical , and his plain face beautiful .
He had a hard fight , for the wise men <unk> well ; but he didn &apos;t know when he was <unk> , and stood to his colors like a man .
Somehow , as he talked , the world got right again to Jo ; the old beliefs , that had lasted so long , seemed better than the new ; God was not a blind force , and <unk> was not a pretty fable , but a blessed fact .
She felt as if she had <unk> ground under her feet again ; and when Mr. Bhaer paused , <unk> , but not one <unk> <unk> , Jo wanted to <unk> her hands and thank him .
She did neither ; but she remembered this scene , and gave the Professor her <unk> respect , for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there , because his conscience would not let him be silent .
She began to see that character is a better possession than money , rank , intellect , or beauty ; and to feel that if <unk> is what a wise man has <unk> it to be , &quot; truth , reverence , and good-will , &quot; then her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good , but great .
This belief strengthened daily .
She valued his <unk> , she coveted his respect , she wanted to be worthy of his friendship ; and , just when the wish was <unk> , she came near losing everything .
It all grew out of a cocked hat ; for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo her lesson , with a paper <unk> on his head , which Tina had put there , and he had forgotten to take off .
&quot; It &apos;s evident he doesn &apos;t look in his glass before coming down , &quot; thought Jo , with a smile , as he said &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and sat soberly down , quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his <unk> , for he was going to read her the &quot; <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : He doesn &apos;t prink at his glass before coming &#93; She said nothing at first , for she liked to hear him laugh out his big , hearty laugh , when anything funny happened , so she left him to discover it for himself , and presently forgot all about it ; for to hear a German read Schiller is rather an <unk> <unk> .
After the reading came the lesson , which was a lively one , for Jo was in a gay mood that night , and the <unk> kept her eyes dancing with merriment .
The Professor didn &apos;t know what to make of her , and stopped at last , to ask , with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible , -- &quot; Mees Marsch , for what do you laugh in your master &apos;s face ?
<unk> you no respect for me , that you go on so bad ? &quot;
&quot; How can I be respectful , sir , when you forget to take your hat off ? &quot;
said Jo .
<unk> his hand to his head , the absent-minded Professor gravely felt and removed the little <unk> , looked at it a minute , and then threw back his head , and laughed like a merry <unk> .
&quot; Ah !
I see him now ; it is that <unk> Tina who makes me a fool with my cap .
Well , it is nothing ; but see you , if this lesson goes not well , you too shall wear him . &quot;
But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes , because Mr. Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat , and , unfolding it , said , with an air of great disgust , -- &quot; I wish these papers did not come in the house ; they are not for children to see , nor young people to read .
It is not well , and I haf no patience with those who make this harm . &quot;
Jo glanced at the sheet , and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a <unk> , a <unk> , a villain , and a <unk> .
She did not like it ; but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of <unk> , but fear , because , for a minute , she fancied the paper was the &quot; Volcano . &quot;
It was not , however , and her panic subsided as she remembered that , even if it had been , and one of her own tales in it , there would have been no name to betray her .
She had betrayed herself , however , by a look and a blush ; for , though an absent man , the Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied .
He knew that Jo wrote , and had met her down among the newspaper <unk> more than once ; but as she never spoke of it , he asked no questions , in spite of a strong desire to see her work .
Now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own , and it troubled him .
He did not say to himself , &quot; It is none of my business ; I &apos;ve no right to say anything , &quot; as many people would have done ; he only remembered that she was young and poor , a girl far away from mother &apos;s love and father &apos;s care ; and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would <unk> him to put out his hand to save a baby from a <unk> .
All this flashed through his mind in a minute , but not a <unk> of it appeared in his face ; and by the time the paper was turned , and Jo &apos;s needle <unk> , he was ready to say quite naturally , but very gravely , -- &quot; Yes , you are right to put it from you .
I do not like to think that good young girls should see such things .
They are made pleasant to some , but I would more rather give my boys <unk> to play with than this bad trash . &quot;
&quot; All may not be bad , only silly , you know ; and if there is a demand for it , I don &apos;t see any harm in <unk> it .
Many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories , &quot; said Jo , scratching <unk> so energetically that a row of little <unk> followed her pin .
&quot; There is a demand for <unk> , but I think you and I do not care to sell it .
If the respectable people knew what harm they did , they would not feel that the living _ was _ honest .
They haf no right to put <unk> in the <unk> , and let the small ones eat it .
No ; they should think a little , and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing . &quot;
Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly , and walked to the fire , <unk> the paper in his hands .
Jo sat still , looking as if the fire had come to her ; for her cheeks <unk> long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke , and gone <unk> up the <unk> .
&quot; I should like much to send all the rest after him , &quot; muttered the Professor , coming back with a relieved air .
Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make , and her <unk> money lay rather <unk> on her conscience at that minute .
Then she thought consolingly to herself , &quot; Mine are not like that ; they are only silly , never bad , so I won &apos;t be worried ; &quot; and taking up her book , she said , with a studious face , -- &quot; Shall we go on , sir ?
I &apos;ll be very good and proper now . &quot;
&quot; I shall hope so , &quot; was all he said , but he meant more than she imagined ; and the grave , kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words &quot; Weekly Volcano &quot; were printed in large <unk> on her forehead .
As soon as she went to her room , she got out her papers , and carefully <unk> every one of her stories .
Being a little short-sighted , Mr. Bhaer sometimes used <unk> , and Jo had tried them once , smiling to see how they <unk> the fine print of her book ; now she seemed to have got on the Professor &apos;s mental or moral spectacles also ; for the faults of these poor stories <unk> at her dreadfully , and filled her with dismay .
&quot; They _ are _ trash , and will soon be worse than trash if I go on ; for each is more sensational than the last .
I &apos;ve gone blindly on , <unk> myself and other people , for the sake of money ; I know it &apos;s so , for I can &apos;t read this stuff in sober earnest without being <unk> ashamed of it ; and what _ should _ I do if they were seen at home , or Mr. Bhaer got hold of them ? &quot;
Jo turned hot at the bare idea , and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove , nearly setting the <unk> <unk> with the blaze .
&#91; Illustration : Jo stuffed the whole bundle into the stove &#93; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s the best place for such <unk> nonsense ; I &apos;d better burn the house down , I suppose , than let other people blow themselves up with my <unk> , &quot; she thought , as she watched the &quot; <unk> of the <unk> &quot; whisk away , a little black <unk> with <unk> eyes .
But when nothing remained of all her three months &apos; work except a heap of <unk> , and the money in her lap , Jo looked sober , as she sat on the floor , wondering what she ought to do about her <unk> .
&quot; I think I haven &apos;t done much harm _ yet _ , and may keep this to pay for my time , &quot; she said , after a long <unk> , adding impatiently , &quot; I almost wish I hadn &apos;t any conscience , it &apos;s so <unk> .
If I didn &apos;t care about doing right , and didn &apos;t feel uncomfortable when doing wrong , I should get on capitally .
I can &apos;t help wishing sometimes , that father and mother hadn &apos;t been so particular about such things . &quot;
Ah , Jo , instead of wishing that , thank God that &quot; father and mother _ were _ particular , &quot; and pity from your heart those who have no such <unk> to hedge them round with <unk> which may seem like <unk> to impatient youth , but which will prove sure <unk> to <unk> character upon in womanhood .
Jo wrote no more sensational stories , <unk> that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation ; but , going to the other <unk> , as is the way with people of her <unk> , she took a course of Mrs. <unk> , Miss <unk> , and Hannah More ; and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an <unk> or a sermon , so <unk> moral was it .
She had her doubts about it from the beginning ; for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done <unk> in the stiff and <unk> costume of the last <unk> .
She sent this <unk> <unk> to several <unk> , but it found no <unk> ; and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood , that <unk> didn &apos;t sell .
Then she tried a child &apos;s story , which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand <unk> <unk> for it .
The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try <unk> literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to <unk> all the world to his particular belief .
But much as she liked to write for children , Jo could not consent to <unk> all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad <unk> , because they did not go to a particular <unk> , nor all the good infants , who did go , as <unk> by every kind of bliss , from <unk> gingerbread to <unk> of angels , when they departed this life with <unk> or sermons on their <unk> tongues .
So nothing came of these trials ; and Jo <unk> up her inkstand , and said , in a fit of very wholesome humility , -- &quot; I don &apos;t know anything ; I &apos;ll wait till I do before I try again , and , meantime , &apos; sweep mud in the street , &apos; if I can &apos;t do better ; that &apos;s honest , at least ; &quot; which decision proved that her second tumble down the <unk> had done her some good .
While these <unk> <unk> were going on , her <unk> life had been as busy and <unk> as usual ; and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer .
He did it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and <unk> by his <unk> ; but she stood the test , and he was satisfied ; for , though no words passed between them , he knew that she had given up writing .
Not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer <unk> , but she spent her evenings downstairs now , was met no more among newspaper <unk> , and studied with a <unk> patience , which assured him that she was bent on <unk> her mind with something useful , if not pleasant .
He helped her in many ways , proving himself a true friend , and Jo was happy ; for , while her pen lay idle , she was learning other lessons beside German , and laying a <unk> for the sensation story of her own life .
It was a pleasant winter and a long one , for she did not leave Mrs. Kirke till June .
Every one seemed sorry when the time came ; the children were <unk> , and Mr. Bhaer &apos;s hair stuck straight up all over his head , for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind .
&quot; Going home ?
Ah , you are happy that you haf a home to go in , &quot; he said , when she told him , and sat silently pulling his beard , in the corner , while she held a little <unk> on that last evening .
She was going early , so she bade them all good-by over night ; and when his turn came , she said warmly , -- &quot; Now , sir , you won &apos;t forget to come and see us , if you ever travel our way , will you ?
I &apos;ll never forgive you if you do , for I want them all to know my friend . &quot;
&quot; Do you ?
Shall I come ? &quot;
he asked , looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see .
&quot; Yes , come next month ; Laurie <unk> then , and you &apos;d enjoy <unk> as something new . &quot;
&quot; That is your best friend , of whom you speak ? &quot;
he said , in an altered tone .
&quot; Yes , my boy Teddy ; I &apos;m very proud of him , and should like you to see him . &quot;
Jo looked up then , quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another .
Something in Mr. Bhaer &apos;s face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than a &quot; best friend , &quot; and , simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter , she involuntarily began to blush ; and the more she tried not to , the redder she grew .
If it had not been for Tina on her knee , she didn &apos;t know what would have become of her .
Fortunately , the child was moved to hug her ; so she managed to hide her face an instant , hoping the Professor did not see it .
But he did , and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression , as he said cordially , -- &quot; I fear I shall not make the time for that , but I wish the friend much success , and you all happiness .
Gott bless you ! &quot;
and with that , he shook hands warmly , <unk> Tina , and went away .
But after the boys were <unk> , he sat long before his fire , with the tired look on his face , and the &quot; _ <unk> _ , &quot; or <unk> , lying heavy at his heart .
Once , when he remembered Jo , as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new <unk> in her face , he leaned his head on his hands a minute , and then roamed about the room , as if in search of something that he could not find .
&quot; It is not for me ; I must not hope it now , &quot; he said to himself , with a sigh that was almost a groan ; then , as if <unk> himself for the longing that he could not <unk> , he went and kissed the two <unk> heads upon the pillow , took down his <unk> <unk> , and opened his Plato .
He did his best , and did it manfully ; but I don &apos;t think he found that a pair of <unk> boys , a <unk> , or even the divine Plato , were very satisfactory <unk> for wife and child and home .
<unk> as it was , he was at the <unk> , next morning , to see Jo off ; and , thanks to him , she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell , a bunch of <unk> to keep her company , and , best of all , the happy thought , -- &quot; Well , the winter &apos;s gone , and I &apos;ve written no books , earned no fortune ; but I &apos;ve made a friend worth having , and I &apos;ll try to keep him all my life . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : He put the sisters into the carriage &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
Whatever his <unk> might have been , Laurie studied to some purpose that year , for he <unk> with honor , and gave the Latin <unk> with the grace of a <unk> and the eloquence of a <unk> , so his friends said .
They were all there , his grandfather , <unk> , so proud ! <unk> .
and Mrs. March , John and Meg , Jo and Beth , and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time , but fail to win from the world by any <unk> .
&quot; I &apos;ve got to stay for this confounded supper , but I shall be home early to-morrow ; you &apos;ll come and meet me as usual , girls ? &quot;
Laurie said , as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over .
He said &quot; girls , &quot; but he meant Jo , for she was the only one who kept up the old <unk> ; she had not the heart to refuse her splendid , successful boy anything , and answered warmly , -- &quot; I &apos;ll come , Teddy , rain or shine , and march before you , playing &apos; _ <unk> the <unk> hero comes _ , &apos; on a <unk> . &quot;
Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think , in a sudden panic , &quot; Oh , deary me !
I know he &apos;ll say something , and then what shall I do ? &quot;
<unk> <unk> and morning work somewhat <unk> her fears , and having decided that she wouldn &apos;t be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be , she set forth at the <unk> time , hoping Teddy wouldn &apos;t do anything to make her hurt his poor little feelings .
A call at Meg &apos;s , and a refreshing sniff and <unk> at the Daisy and <unk> , still further <unk> her for the _ <unk> ? <unk> ? <unk> ? te _ , but when she saw a <unk> figure <unk> in the distance , she had a strong desire to turn about and run away .
&quot; Where &apos;s the <unk> , Jo ? &quot;
cried Laurie , as soon as he was within speaking distance .
&quot; I forgot it ; &quot; and Jo took heart again , for that <unk> could not be called <unk> .
She always used to take his arm on these occasions ; now she did not , and he made no <unk> , which was a bad sign , but talked on rapidly about all sorts of <unk> <unk> , till they turned from the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove .
Then he walked more slowly , suddenly lost his fine <unk> of language , and , now and then , a dreadful pause occurred .
To rescue the conversation from one of the <unk> of silence into which it kept falling , Jo said hastily , -- &quot; Now you must have a good long holiday ! &quot;
&quot; I intend to . &quot;
Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come , and made her put out her hand with an imploring , -- &quot; No , Teddy , please don &apos;t ! &quot;
&quot; I will , and you _ must _ hear me .
It &apos;s no use , Jo ; we &apos;ve got to have it out , and the sooner the better for both of us , &quot; he answered , getting flushed and excited all at once .
&quot; Say what you like , then ; I &apos;ll listen , &quot; said Jo , with a desperate sort of patience .
Laurie was a young lover , but he was in earnest , and meant to &quot; have it out , &quot; if he died in the attempt ; so he <unk> into the subject with characteristic <unk> , saying in a voice that _ would _ get <unk> now and then , in spite of <unk> efforts to keep it steady , -- &quot; I &apos;ve loved you ever since I &apos;ve known you , Jo ; couldn &apos;t help it , you &apos;ve been so good to me .
I &apos;ve tried to show it , but you wouldn &apos;t let me ; now I &apos;m going to make you hear , and give me an answer , for I _ can &apos;t _ go on so any longer . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to save you this ; I thought you &apos;d <unk> &quot; began Jo , finding it a great deal harder than she expected .
&quot; I know you did ; but girls are so queer you never know what they mean .
They say No when they mean Yes , and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it , &quot; returned Laurie , <unk> himself behind an <unk> fact .
&quot; _ I _ don &apos;t .
I never wanted to make you care for me so , and I went away to keep you from it if I could . &quot;
&quot; I thought so ; it was like you , but it was no use .
I only loved you all the more , and I worked hard to please you , and I gave up <unk> and everything you didn &apos;t like , and waited and never complained , for I hoped you &apos;d love me , though I &apos;m not half good <unk> &quot; here there was a choke that couldn &apos;t be <unk> , so he <unk> <unk> while he cleared his &quot; confounded throat . &quot;
&quot; Yes , you are ; you &apos;re a great deal too good for me , and I &apos;m so grateful to you , and so proud and fond of you , I don &apos;t see why I can &apos;t love you as you want me to .
I &apos;ve tried , but I can &apos;t change the feeling , and it would be a lie to say I do when I don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; Really , truly , Jo ? &quot;
He stopped short , and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget .
&quot; Really , truly , dear . &quot;
They were in the grove now , close by the <unk> ; and when the last words fell reluctantly from Jo &apos;s lips , Laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on , but for once in his life that fence was too much for him ; so he just laid his head down on the mossy post , and stood so still that Jo was frightened .
&#91; Illustration : He laid his head down on the mossy post &#93; &quot; O Teddy , I &apos;m so sorry , so desperately sorry , I could kill myself if it would do any good !
I wish you wouldn &apos;t take it so hard .
I can &apos;t help it ; you know it &apos;s impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they don &apos;t , &quot; cried Jo <unk> but <unk> , as she softly patted his shoulder , remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago .
&quot; They do sometimes , &quot; said a muffled voice from the post .
&quot; I don &apos;t believe it &apos;s the right sort of love , and I &apos;d rather not try it , &quot; was the decided answer .
There was a long pause , while a <unk> sung blithely on the <unk> by the river , and the tall grass rustled in the wind .
Presently Jo said very soberly , as she sat down on the step of the <unk> , -- &quot; Laurie , I want to tell you something . &quot;
He started as if he had been shot , threw up his head , and cried out , in a fierce <unk> &quot; _ Don &apos;t _ tell me that , Jo ; I can &apos;t bear it now ! &quot;
&quot; Tell what ? &quot;
she asked , wondering at his <unk> .
&quot; That you love that old man . &quot;
&quot; What old man ? &quot;
demanded Jo , thinking he must mean his grandfather .
&quot; That <unk> Professor you were always writing about .
If you say you love him , I know I shall do something desperate ; &quot; and he looked as if he would keep his word , as he <unk> his hands , with a wrathful <unk> in his eyes .
Jo wanted to laugh , but restrained herself , and said warmly , for she , too , was getting excited with all this , -- &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> , Teddy !
He isn &apos;t old , nor anything bad , but good and kind , and the best friend I &apos;ve got , next to you .
Pray , don &apos;t fly into a passion ; I want to be kind , but I know I shall get angry if you <unk> my Professor .
I haven &apos;t the least idea of loving him or anybody else . &quot;
&quot; But you will after a while , and then what will become of me ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll love some one else too , like a sensible boy , and forget all this trouble . &quot;
&quot; I _ can &apos;t _ love any one else ; and I &apos;ll never forget you , Jo , never !
never ! &quot;
with a <unk> to <unk> his passionate words .
&quot; What _ shall _ I do with him ? &quot;
sighed Jo , finding that emotions were more <unk> than she expected .
&quot; You haven &apos;t heard what I wanted to tell you .
Sit down and listen ; for indeed I want to do right and make you happy , &quot; she said , hoping to soothe him with a little reason , which proved that she knew nothing about love .
Seeing a <unk> of hope in that last speech , Laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet , leaned his arm on the lower step of the <unk> , and looked up at her with an <unk> face .
Now that arrangement was not <unk> to calm speech or clear thought on Jo &apos;s part ; for how _ could _ she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing , and <unk> still wet with the bitter drop or two her <unk> of heart had wrung from him ?
She gently turned his head away , saying , as she <unk> the <unk> hair which had been allowed to grow for her sake , --how touching that was , to be sure ! -- &quot; I agree with mother that you and I are not suited to each other , because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable , if we were so foolish as <unk> &quot; Jo paused a little over the last word , but Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression , -- &quot; <unk> , <unk> , we shouldn &apos;t !
If you loved me , Jo , I should be a perfect saint , for you could make me anything you like . &quot;
&quot; No , I can &apos;t .
I &apos;ve tried it and failed , and I won &apos;t <unk> our happiness by such a serious experiment .
We don &apos;t agree and we never shall ; so we &apos;ll be good friends all our lives , but we won &apos;t go and do anything rash . &quot;
&quot; Yes , we will if we get the chance , &quot; muttered Laurie rebelliously .
&quot; Now do be reasonable , and take a sensible view of the case , &quot; implored Jo , almost at her <unk> &apos;s end .
&quot; I won &apos;t be reasonable ; I don &apos;t want to take what you call &apos; a sensible view ; &apos; it won &apos;t help me , and it only makes you harder .
I don &apos;t believe you &apos;ve got any heart . &quot;
&quot; I wish I hadn &apos;t ! &quot;
There was a little quiver in Jo &apos;s voice , and , thinking it a good omen , Laurie turned round , bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he said , in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so <unk> wheedlesome before , -- &quot; Don &apos;t disappoint us , dear !
Every one <unk> it .
Grandpa has set his heart upon it , your people like it , and I can &apos;t get on without you .
Say you will , and let &apos;s be happy .
Do , do ! &quot;
Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy , and never could .
It was very hard to do , but she did it , knowing that delay was both <unk> and cruel .
&quot; I can &apos;t say &apos; Yes &apos; truly , so I won &apos;t say it at all .
You &apos;ll see that I &apos;m right , by and by , and thank me for it &quot; <unk> began solemnly .
&quot; I &apos;ll be <unk> if I do ! &quot;
and Laurie bounced up off the grass , burning with indignation at the bare idea .
&quot; Yes , you will ! &quot;
persisted Jo ; &quot; you &apos;ll get over this after a while , and find some lovely , accomplished girl , who will adore you , and make a fine mistress for your fine house .
I shouldn &apos;t .
I &apos;m homely and awkward and odd and old , and you &apos;d be ashamed of me , and we should quarrel , <unk> can &apos;t help it even now , you see , --and I shouldn &apos;t like elegant society and you would , and you &apos;d hate my scribbling , and I couldn &apos;t get on without it , and we should be unhappy , and wish we hadn &apos;t done it , and everything would be horrid ! &quot;
&quot; Anything more ? &quot;
asked Laurie , finding it hard to listen patiently to this <unk> burst .
&quot; Nothing more , except that I don &apos;t believe I shall ever marry .
I &apos;m happy as I am , and love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up for any mortal man . &quot;
&quot; I know better ! &quot;
broke in Laurie .
&quot; You think so now ; but there &apos;ll come a time when you _ will _ care for somebody , and you &apos;ll love him tremendously , and live and die for him .
I know you will , it &apos;s your way , and I shall have to stand by and see it ; &quot; and the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical , if his face had not been so tragical .
&quot; Yes , I _ will _ live and die for him , if he ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself , and you must do the best you can ! &quot;
cried Jo , losing patience with poor Teddy .
&quot; I &apos;ve done my best , but you _ won &apos;t _ be reasonable , and it &apos;s selfish of you to keep <unk> for what I can &apos;t give .
I shall always be fond of you , very fond indeed , as a friend , but I &apos;ll never marry you ; and the sooner you believe it , the better for both of us , --so now ! &quot;
That speech was like fire to <unk> .
Laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself , then turned sharply away , saying , in a desperate sort of tone , -- &quot; You &apos;ll be sorry some day , Jo . &quot;
&quot; Oh , where are you going ? &quot;
she cried , for his face frightened her .
&quot; To the <unk> ! &quot;
was the <unk> answer .
For a minute Jo &apos;s heart stood still , as he swung himself down the bank , toward the river ; but it takes much folly , sin , or misery to send a young man to a violent death , and Laurie was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure .
He had no thought of a melodramatic <unk> , but some blind instinct led him to <unk> hat and coat into his boat , and row away with all his might , making better time up the river than he had done in many a race .
Jo drew a long breath and <unk> her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to <unk> the trouble which he carried in his heart .
&quot; That will do him good , and he &apos;ll come home in such a tender , penitent state of mind , that I sha &apos;n&apos;t dare to see him , &quot; she said ; adding , as she went slowly home , feeling as if she had <unk> some innocent thing , and buried it under the leaves , -- &quot; Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy .
I wish he &apos;d love Beth ; perhaps he may , in time , but I begin to think I was mistaken about her .
Oh dear !
how can girls like to have lovers and refuse them .
I think it &apos;s dreadful . &quot;
Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself , she went straight to Mr. Laurence , told the hard story bravely through , and then broke down , crying so dismally over her own <unk> that the kind old gentleman , though sorely disappointed , did not utter a reproach .
He found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie , and hoped she would change her mind , but he knew even better than Jo that love cannot be forced , so he shook his head sadly , and resolved to carry his boy out of harm &apos;s way ; for Young <unk> &apos;s parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess .
When Laurie came home , dead tired , but quite composed , his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing , and kept up the delusion very <unk> for an hour or two .
But when they sat together in the twilight , the time they used to enjoy so much , it was hard work for the old man to <unk> on as usual , and harder still for the young one to listen to <unk> of the last year &apos;s success , which to him now seemed love &apos;s labor lost .
He bore it as long as he could , then went to his piano , and began to play .
The windows were open ; and Jo , walking in the garden with Beth , for once understood music better than her sister , for he played the &quot; <unk> <unk> ? <unk> , &quot; and played it as he never did before .
&quot; That &apos;s very fine , I dare say , but it &apos;s sad enough to make one cry ; give us something <unk> , lad , &quot; said Mr. Laurence , whose kind old heart was full of sympathy , which he longed to show , but knew not how .
Laurie <unk> into a <unk> strain , played <unk> for several minutes , and would have got through bravely , if , in a momentary lull , Mrs. March &apos;s voice had not been heard calling , -- &quot; Jo , dear , come in ; I want you . &quot;
Just what Laurie longed to say , with a different meaning !
As he listened , he lost his place ; the music ended with a broken <unk> , and the musician sat silent in the dark .
&quot; I can &apos;t stand this , &quot; muttered the old gentleman .
Up he got , <unk> his way to the piano , laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders , and said , as gently as a woman , -- &quot; I know , my boy , I know . &quot;
No answer for an instant ; then Laurie asked sharply , -- &quot; Who told you ? &quot;
&quot; Jo herself . &quot;
&quot; Then there &apos;s an end of it ! &quot;
and he shook off his grandfather &apos;s hands with an impatient motion ; for , though grateful for the sympathy , his man &apos;s pride could not bear a man &apos;s pity .
&quot; Not quite ; I want to say one thing , and then there shall be an end of it , &quot; returned Mr. Laurence , with unusual <unk> .
&quot; You won &apos;t care to stay at home just now , perhaps ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t intend to run away from a girl .
Jo can &apos;t prevent my seeing her , and I shall stay and do it as long as I like , &quot; interrupted Laurie , in a <unk> tone .
&quot; Not if you are the gentleman I think you .
I &apos;m disappointed , but the girl can &apos;t help it ; and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time .
Where will you go ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> .
I don &apos;t care what becomes of me ; &quot; and Laurie got up , with a <unk> laugh , that <unk> on his grandfather &apos;s ear .
&quot; Take it like a man , and don &apos;t do anything rash , for God &apos;s sake .
Why not go abroad , as you planned , and forget it ? &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; But you &apos;ve been wild to go , and I promised you should when you got through college . &quot;
&quot; Ah , but I didn &apos;t mean to go alone ! &quot;
and Laurie walked fast through the room , with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see .
&quot; I don &apos;t ask you to go alone ; there &apos;s some one ready and glad to go with you , anywhere in the world . &quot;
&quot; Who , sir ? &quot;
stopping to listen .
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
Laurie came back as quickly as he went , and put out his hand , saying <unk> , -- &quot; I &apos;m a selfish <unk> ; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; Lord help me , yes , I do know , for I &apos;ve been through it all before , once in my own young days , and then with your father .
Now , my dear boy , just sit quietly down , and hear my plan .
It &apos;s all settled , and can be carried out at once , &quot; said Mr. Laurence , keeping hold of the young man , as if fearful that he would break away , as his father had done before him .
&quot; Well , sir , what is it ? &quot;
and Laurie sat down , without a sign of interest in face or voice .
&quot; There is business in London that needs looking after ; I meant you should attend to it ; but I can do it better myself , and things here will get on very well with Brooke to manage them .
My <unk> do almost everything ; I &apos;m merely holding on till you take my place , and can be off at any time . &quot;
&quot; But you hate travelling , sir ; I can &apos;t ask it of you at your age , &quot; began Laurie , who was grateful for the sacrifice , but much preferred to go alone , if he went at all .
The old gentleman knew that perfectly well , and particularly desired to prevent it ; for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices .
So , <unk> a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him , he said stoutly , -- &quot; Bless your soul , I &apos;m not <unk> yet .
I quite enjoy the idea ; it will do me good , and my old <unk> won &apos;t suffer , for travelling <unk> is almost as easy as sitting in a chair . &quot;
A restless movement from Laurie suggested that _ his _ chair was not easy , or that he did not like the plan , and made the old man add hastily , -- &quot; I don &apos;t mean to be a <unk> or a burden ; I go because I think you &apos;d feel happier than if I was left behind .
I don &apos;t intend to <unk> about with you , but leave you free to go where you like , while I amuse myself in my own way .
I &apos;ve friends in London and Paris , and should like to visit them ; meantime you can go to Italy , Germany , Switzerland , where you will , and enjoy pictures , music , scenery , and adventures to your heart &apos;s content . &quot;
Now , Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken , and the world a <unk> wilderness ; but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman <unk> introduced into his <unk> sentence , the broken heart gave an unexpected leap , and a green <unk> or two suddenly appeared in the <unk> wilderness .
He sighed , and then said , in a <unk> tone , -- &quot; Just as you like , sir ; it doesn &apos;t matter where I go or what I do . &quot;
&quot; It does to me , remember that , my lad ; I give you entire liberty , but I trust you to make an honest use of it .
<unk> me that , Laurie . &quot;
&quot; Anything you like , sir . &quot;
&quot; Good , &quot; thought the old gentleman .
&quot; You don &apos;t care now , but there &apos;ll come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief , or I &apos;m much mistaken . &quot;
Being an energetic individual , Mr. Laurence struck while the <unk> was hot ; and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel , they were off .
During the time necessary for preparation , Laurie bore himself as young gentlemen usually do in such <unk> .
He was moody , <unk> , and pensive by turns ; lost his appetite , neglected his dress , and devoted much time to playing <unk> on his piano ; <unk> Jo , but consoled himself by staring at her from his window , with a tragical face that haunted her dreams by night , and <unk> her with a heavy sense of <unk> by day .
<unk> some <unk> , he never spoke of his <unk> passion , and would allow no one , not even Mrs. March , to attempt consolation or offer sympathy .
On some accounts , this was a relief to his friends ; but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable , and every one rejoiced that the &quot; poor , dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble , and come home happy . &quot;
Of course , he smiled darkly at their delusion , but passed it by , with the sad <unk> of one who knew that his <unk> , like his love , was <unk> .
When the parting came he affected high spirits , to conceal certain <unk> emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves .
This <unk> did not <unk> upon anybody , but they tried to look as if it did , for his sake , and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him , with a whisper full of motherly <unk> ; then , feeling that he was going very fast , he hastily <unk> them all round , not forgetting the afflicted Hannah , and ran downstairs as if for his life .
Jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round .
He did look round , came back , put his arms about her , as she stood on the step above him , and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal both eloquent and pathetic .
&quot; O Jo , can &apos;t you ? &quot;
&#91; Illustration : O Jo , can &apos;t you ? &#93;
&quot; Teddy , dear , I wish I could ! &quot;
That was all , except a little pause ; then Laurie <unk> himself up , said &quot; It &apos;s all right , never mind , &quot; and went away without another word .
Ah , but it wasn &apos;t all right , and Jo _ did _ mind ; for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer , she felt as if she had <unk> her dearest friend ; and when he left her without a look behind him , she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; <unk> .
BETH &apos;S <unk> .
When Jo came home that spring , she had been struck with the change in Beth .
No one spoke of it or seemed <unk> of it , for it had come too gradually to <unk> those who saw her daily ; but to eyes <unk> by absence , it was very plain ; and a heavy weight fell on Jo &apos;s heart as she saw her sister &apos;s face .
It was no <unk> and but little <unk> than in the autumn ; yet there was a strange , <unk> look about it , as if the mortal was being slowly <unk> away , and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an <unk> pathetic beauty .
Jo saw and felt it , but said nothing at the time , and soon the first impression lost much of its power ; for Beth seemed happy , no one appeared to doubt that she was better ; and , presently , in other cares , Jo for a time forgot her fear .
But when Laurie was gone , and peace prevailed again , the vague anxiety returned and haunted her .
She had confessed her sins and been forgiven ; but when she showed her <unk> and proposed the mountain trip , Beth had thanked her heartily , but begged not to go so far away from home .
Another little visit to the <unk> would suit her better , and , as grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies , Jo took Beth down to the quiet place , where she could live much in the open air , and let the fresh <unk> blow a little color into her pale cheeks .
It was not a fashionable place , but , even among the pleasant people there , the girls made few friends , <unk> to live for one another .
Beth was too shy to enjoy society , and Jo too wrapped up in her to care for any one else ; so they were all in all to each other , and came and went , quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about them , who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one , always together , as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away .
They did feel it , yet neither spoke of it ; for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there <unk> a <unk> which it is very hard to overcome .
Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and Beth &apos;s ; but when she put out her hand to lift it up , there seemed something sacred in the silence , and she waited for Beth to speak .
She wondered , and was <unk> also , that her parents did not seem to see what she saw ; and , during the quiet weeks , when the shadow grew so plain to her , she said nothing of it to those at home , believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better .
She wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth , and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm <unk> , with her head in Jo &apos;s lap , while the winds blew healthfully over her , and the sea made music at her feet .

Jo thought she was asleep , she lay so still ; and , putting down her book , sat looking at her with wistful eyes , trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth &apos;s cheeks .
But she could not find enough to satisfy her , for the cheeks were very thin , and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little <unk> they had been gathering .
It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was slowly <unk> away from her , and her arms instinctively <unk> their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed .
For a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing , and , when they cleared , Beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say , -- &quot; Jo , dear , I &apos;m glad you know it .
I &apos;ve tried to tell you , but I couldn &apos;t . &quot;
There was no answer except her sister &apos;s cheek against her own , not even tears ; for when most deeply moved , Jo did not cry .
She was the <unk> , then , and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her , with her arms about her , and the soothing words she whispered in her ear .
&quot; I &apos;ve known it for a good while , dear , and , now I &apos;m used to it , it isn &apos;t hard to think of or to bear .
Try to see it so , and don &apos;t be troubled about me , because it &apos;s best ; indeed it is . &quot;
&quot; Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn , Beth ?
You did not feel it then , and keep it to yourself so long , did you ? &quot;
asked Jo , <unk> to see or say that it _ was _ best , but glad to know that Laurie had no part in Beth &apos;s trouble .
&quot; Yes , I gave up hoping then , but I didn &apos;t like to own it .
I tried to think it was a sick fancy , and would not let it trouble any one .
But when I saw you all so well and strong , and full of happy plans , it was hard to feel that I could never be like you , and then I was miserable , Jo . &quot;
&quot; O Beth , and you didn &apos;t tell me , didn &apos;t let me comfort and help you !
How could you shut me out , and bear it all alone ? &quot;
Jo &apos;s voice was full of tender reproach , and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say good-by to health , love , and life , and take up her cross so cheerfully .
&quot; Perhaps it was wrong , but I tried to do right ; I wasn &apos;t sure , no one said anything , and I hoped I was mistaken .
It would have been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg , and Amy away , and you so happy with Laurie , --at least , I thought so then . &quot;
&quot; And I thought that you loved him , Beth , and I went away because I couldn &apos;t , &quot; cried Jo , glad to say all the truth .
Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain , and added softly , -- &quot; Then you didn &apos;t , deary ?
I was afraid it was so , and imagined your poor little heart full of love-lornity all that while . &quot;
&quot; Why , Jo , how could I , when he was so fond of you ? &quot;
asked Beth , as innocently as a child .
&quot; I do love him dearly ; he is so good to me , how can I help it ?
But he never could be anything to me but my brother .
I hope he truly will be , <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Not through me , &quot; said Jo decidedly .
&quot; Amy is left for him , and they would suit excellently ; but I have no heart for such things , now .
I don &apos;t care what becomes of anybody but you , Beth .
You _ must _ get well . &quot;
&quot; I want to , oh , so much !
I try , but every day I lose a little , and feel more sure that I shall never gain it back .
It &apos;s like the tide , Jo , when it turns , it goes slowly , but it can &apos;t be stopped . &quot;
&quot; It _ shall _ be stopped , your tide must not turn so soon , nineteen is too young .
Beth , I can &apos;t let you go .
I &apos;ll work and pray and fight against it .
I &apos;ll keep you in spite of everything ; there must be ways , it can &apos;t be too late .
God won &apos;t be so cruel as to take you from me , &quot; cried poor Jo rebelliously , for her spirit was far less <unk> submissive than Beth &apos;s .
Simple , sincere people seldom speak much of their <unk> ; it shows itself in acts , rather than in words , and has more influence than <unk> or <unk> .
Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life , and cheerfully wait for death .
Like a confiding child , she asked no questions , but left everything to God and nature , Father and mother of us all , feeling sure that they , and they only , could teach and <unk> heart and spirit for this life and the life to come .
She did not <unk> Jo with saintly speeches , only loved her better for her passionate affection , and clung more closely to the dear human love , from which our Father never means us to be <unk> , but through which He <unk> us <unk> to <unk> .
She could not say , &quot; I &apos;m glad to go , &quot; for life was very sweet to her ; she could only sob out , &quot; I try to be willing , &quot; while she held fast to Jo , as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together .
By and by Beth said , with recovered <unk> , -- &quot; You &apos;ll tell them this when we go home ? &quot;
&quot; I think they will see it without words , &quot; sighed Jo ; for now it seemed to her that Beth changed every day .
&quot; Perhaps not ; I &apos;ve heard that the people who love best are often <unk> to such things .
If they don &apos;t see it , you will tell them for me .
I don &apos;t want any secrets , and it &apos;s kinder to prepare them .
Meg has John and the babies to comfort her , but you must stand by father and mother , won &apos;t you , Jo ? &quot;
&quot; If I can ; but , Beth , I don &apos;t give up yet ; I &apos;m going to believe that it _ is _ a sick fancy , and not let you think it &apos;s true , &quot; said Jo , trying to speak cheerfully .
Beth lay a minute thinking , and then said in her quiet way , -- &quot; I don &apos;t know how to express myself , and shouldn &apos;t try , to any one but you , because I can &apos;t speak out , except to my Jo .
I only mean to say that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long .
I &apos;m not like the rest of you ; I never made any plans about what I &apos;d do when I grew up ; I never thought of being married , as you all did .
I couldn &apos;t seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth , trotting about at home , of no use anywhere but there .
I never wanted to go away , and the hard part now is the leaving you all .
I &apos;m not afraid , but it seems as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven . &quot;
Jo could not speak ; and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the <unk> of the tide .
A <unk> <unk> flew by , with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast ; Beth watched it till it vanished , and her eyes were full of <unk> .
A little <unk> <unk> came <unk> over the <unk> , &quot; peeping &quot; softly to itself , as if enjoying the sun and sea ; it came quite close to Beth , looked at her with a friendly eye , and sat upon a warm stone , dressing its wet feathers , quite at home .
Beth smiled , and felt comforted , for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship , and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed .
&quot; Dear little bird !
See , Jo , how <unk> it is .
I like peeps better than the <unk> : they are not so wild and handsome , but they seem happy , confiding little things .
I used to call them my birds , last summer ; and mother said they reminded her of me , <unk> , <unk> creatures , always near the shore , and always <unk> that contented little song of theirs .
You are the <unk> , Jo , strong and wild , fond of the storm and the wind , flying far out to sea , and happy all alone .
Meg is the <unk> , and Amy is like the lark she writes about , trying to get up among the clouds , but always dropping down into its nest again .
Dear little girl !
she &apos;s so ambitious , but her heart is good and tender ; and no matter how high she <unk> , she never will forget home .
I hope I shall see her again , but she seems _ so _ far away . &quot;
&quot; She is coming in the spring , and I mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her .
I &apos;m going to have you well and rosy by that time , &quot; began Jo , feeling that of all the changes in Beth , the talking change was the greatest , for it seemed to cost no effort now , and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth .
&quot; Jo , dear , don &apos;t hope any more ; it won &apos;t do any good , I &apos;m sure of that .
We won &apos;t be miserable , but enjoy being together while we wait .
We &apos;ll have happy times , for I don &apos;t suffer much , and I think the tide will go out easily , if you help me . &quot;
Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face ; and with that silent kiss , she <unk> herself soul and body to Beth .
She was right : there was no need of any words when they got home , for father and mother saw plainly , now , what they had prayed to be saved from seeing .
<unk> with her short journey , Beth went at once to bed , saying how glad she was to be at home ; and when Jo went down , she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling Beth &apos;s secret .
Her father stood leaning his head on the mantel-piece , and did not turn as she came in ; but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help , and Jo went to comfort her without a word .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : He hurried forward to meet her &#93; <unk> .
NEW <unk> .
At three o &apos;clock in the afternoon , all the fashionable world at Nice may be seen on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , --a charming place ; for the wide walk , <unk> with <unk> , flowers , and <unk> <unk> , is <unk> on one side by the sea , on the other by the grand drive , lined with <unk> and <unk> , while beyond lie <unk> and the hills .
Many nations are represented , many languages spoken , many costumes worn ; and , on a sunny day , the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a <unk> .
<unk> English , lively French , sober Germans , handsome <unk> , ugly <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Americans , all drive , sit , or <unk> here , chatting over the news , and <unk> the latest <unk> who has arrived , <unk> or Dickens , <unk> <unk> or the Queen of the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are as <unk> as the company , and <unk> as much attention , especially the low <unk> in which ladies drive themselves , with a pair of dashing ponies , gay <unk> to keep their <unk> <unk> from <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and little grooms on the perch behind .
Along this walk , on Christmas Day , a tall young man walked slowly , with his hands behind him , and a somewhat absent expression of countenance .
He looked like an Italian , was dressed like an <unk> , and had the independent air of an American , --a <unk> which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him , and sundry <unk> in black velvet suits , with <unk> <unk> , <unk> gloves , and <unk> in their button-holes , to shrug their shoulders , and then envy him his <unk> .
There were plenty of pretty faces to admire , but the young man took little notice of them , except to glance , now and then , at some <unk> girl , or lady in blue .
Presently he strolled out of the promenade , and stood a moment at the <unk> , as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the <unk> <unk> , or to <unk> along the <unk> toward <unk> <unk> .
The quick <unk> of ponies &apos; feet made him look up , as one of the little carriages , <unk> a single lady , came rapidly down the street .
The lady was young , <unk> , and dressed in blue .
He stared a minute , then his whole face woke up , and , waving his hat like a boy , he hurried forward to meet her .
&quot; O Laurie , is it really you ?
I thought you &apos;d never come ! &quot;
cried Amy , dropping the reins , and holding out both hands , to the great <unk> of a French mamma , who <unk> her daughter &apos;s steps , lest she should be <unk> by <unk> the free manners of these &quot; mad English . &quot;
&quot; I was <unk> by the way , but I promised to spend Christmas with you , and here I am . &quot;
&quot; How is your grandfather ?
When did you come ?
Where are you <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Very <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
I called at your <unk> , but you were all out . &quot;
&quot; I have so much to say , I don &apos;t know where to begin !
Get in , and we can talk at our ease ; I was going for a drive , and longing for company .
Flo &apos;s saving up for to-night . &quot;
&quot; What happens then , a ball ? &quot;
&quot; A Christmas party at our <unk> .
There are many Americans there , and they give it in honor of the day .
You &apos;ll go with us , of course ?
Aunt will be charmed . &quot;
&quot; Thank you .
Where now ? &quot;
asked Laurie , leaning back and folding his arms , a proceeding which suited Amy , who preferred to drive ; for her <unk> and blue reins over the white ponies &apos; backs , afforded her infinite satisfaction .
&quot; I &apos;m going to the <unk> &apos;s first , for letters , and then to <unk> <unk> ; the view is so lovely , and I like to feed the peacocks .
Have you ever been there ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , years ago ; but I don &apos;t mind having a look at it . &quot;
&quot; Now tell me all about yourself .
The last I heard of you , your grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Yes , I spent a month there , and then joined him in Paris , where he has settled for the winter .
He has friends there , and finds plenty to amuse him ; so I go and come , and we get on capitally . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s a sociable arrangement , &quot; said Amy , missing something in Laurie &apos;s manner , though she couldn &apos;t tell what .
&quot; Why , you see he hates to travel , and I hate to keep still ; so we each suit ourselves , and there is no trouble .
I am often with him , and he <unk> my adventures , while I like to feel that some one is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings .
<unk> old hole , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
he added , with a look of disgust , as they drove along the <unk> to the <unk> Napoleon , in the old city .
&quot; The dirt is picturesque , so I don &apos;t mind .
The river and the hills are delicious , and these glimpses of the narrow <unk> are my delight .
Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass ; it &apos;s going to the <unk> of St.
John . &quot;
While Laurie <unk> watched the procession of <unk> under their <unk> , <unk> <unk> bearing lighted <unk> , and some <unk> in blue , chanting as they walked , Amy watched him , and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her ; for he was changed , and she could not find the <unk> boy she left in the <unk> man beside her .
He was <unk> than ever , and greatly improved , she thought ; but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over , he looked tired and <unk> , --not sick , nor exactly unhappy , but older and <unk> than a year or two of <unk> life should have made him .
She couldn &apos;t understand it , and did not venture to ask questions ; so she shook her head , and touched up her ponies , as the procession wound away across the <unk> of the <unk> bridge , and vanished in the <unk> .
&quot; _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ ? &quot;
she said , airing her French , which had improved in quantity , if not in <unk> , since she came abroad .
&quot; That mademoiselle has made good use of her time , and the result is charming , &quot; replied Laurie , <unk> , with his hand on his heart , and an admiring look .
She blushed with pleasure , but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt <unk> he used to give her at home , when he promenaded round her on festival occasions , and told her she was &quot; altogether jolly , &quot; with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head .
She didn &apos;t like the new tone ; for , though not _ <unk> ? _ , it sounded indifferent in spite of the look .
&quot; If that &apos;s the way he &apos;s going to grow up , I wish he &apos;d stay a boy , &quot; she thought , with a curious sense of disappointment and <unk> , trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay .
At <unk> &apos;s she found the precious <unk> , and , giving the reins to Laurie , read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green <unk> , where <unk> bloomed as freshly as in June .
&quot; Beth is very poorly , mother says .
I often think I ought to go home , but they all say &apos; stay ; &apos; so I do , for I shall never have another chance like this , &quot; said Amy , looking sober over one page .
&quot; I think you are right , there ; you could do nothing at home , and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy , and enjoying so much , my dear . &quot;
He drew a little nearer , and looked more like his old self , as he said that ; and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy &apos;s heart was <unk> , for the look , the act , the brotherly &quot; my dear , &quot; seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come , she would not be alone in a strange land .
Presently she laughed , and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her <unk> , with the bow <unk> erect upon her cap , and issuing from her mouth the words , &quot; <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
Laurie smiled , took it , put it in his <unk> , &quot; to keep it from blowing away , &quot; and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read him .
&quot; This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me , with presents in the morning , you and letters in the afternoon , and a party at night , &quot; said Amy , as they <unk> among the ruins of the old <unk> , and a flock of splendid peacocks came <unk> about them , <unk> waiting to be fed .
While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered <unk> to the brilliant birds , Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him , with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought .
He found nothing to <unk> or disappoint , much to admire and approve ; for , <unk> a few little <unk> of speech and manner , she was as sprightly and graceful as ever , with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance .
<unk> <unk> for her age , she had <unk> a certain _ <unk> _ in both carriage and conversation , which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was ; but her old <unk> now and then showed itself , her strong will still held its own , and her native frankness was <unk> by foreign polish .
Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks , but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him , and carried away a pretty little picture of a <unk> girl standing in the sunshine , which brought out the soft <unk> of her dress , the fresh color of her cheeks , the golden <unk> of her hair , and made her a <unk> figure in the pleasant scene .
As they came up on to the stone <unk> that <unk> the hill , Amy waved her hand as if <unk> him to her favorite haunt , and said , pointing here and there , -- &quot; Do you remember the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> their <unk> in the <unk> , and the lovely road to <unk> <unk> , <unk> &apos;s <unk> , just below , and , best of all , that speck far out to sea which they say is <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; I remember ; it &apos;s not much changed , &quot; he answered , without enthusiasm .
&quot; What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck ! &quot;
said Amy , feeling in good spirits , and anxious to see him so also .
&quot; Yes , &quot; was all he said , but he turned and <unk> his eyes to see the <unk> which a greater <unk> than even Napoleon now made interesting in his sight .
&quot; Take a good look at it for her sake , and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while , &quot; said Amy , <unk> herself , ready for a good talk .
But she did not get it ; for , though he joined her , and answered all her questions freely , she could only learn that he had <unk> about the <unk> and been to <unk> .
So , after <unk> away an hour , they drove home again ; and , having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol , Laurie left them , promising to return in the evening .
It must be <unk> of Amy that she <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; that night .
Time and absence had done its work on both the young people ; she had seen her old friend in a new light , not as &quot; our boy , &quot; but as a handsome and agreeable man , and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight .
Amy knew her good points , and made the most of them , with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman .
<unk> and <unk> were cheap at Nice , so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions , and , following the sensible English fashion of simple dress for young girls , got up charming little <unk> with fresh flowers , a few <unk> , and all manner of dainty devices , which were both <unk> and effective .
It must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman , and indulged in antique _ <unk> _ , <unk> attitudes , and <unk> <unk> .
But , dear heart , we all have our little <unk> , and find it easy to pardon such in the young , who satisfy our eyes with their <unk> , and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities .
&quot; I do want him to think I look well , and tell them so at home , &quot; said Amy to herself , as she put on Flo &apos;s old white silk ball-dress , and covered it with a cloud of fresh <unk> , out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect .
Her hair she had the sense to let alone , after gathering up the thick <unk> and curls into a <unk> <unk> at the back of her head .
&quot; It &apos;s not the fashion , but it &apos;s becoming , and I can &apos;t afford to make a fright of myself , &quot; she used to say , when advised to frizzle , <unk> , or <unk> , as the latest style commanded .
Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion , Amy <unk> her <unk> skirts with rosy <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> the white shoulders in delicate green vines .
<unk> the painted boots , she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction , and _ <unk> ? <unk> _ down the room , admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself .
&quot; My new fan just <unk> my flowers , my gloves fit to a charm , and the real lace on aunt &apos;s _ <unk> _ gives an air to my whole dress .
If I only had a <unk> nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy , &quot; she said , surveying herself with a critical eye , and a <unk> in each hand .
In spite of this affliction , she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away ; she seldom ran , --it did not suit her style , she thought , for , being tall , the stately and <unk> was more appropriate than the <unk> or <unk> .
She walked up and down the long saloon while waiting for Laurie , and once arranged herself under the <unk> , which had a good effect upon her hair ; then she thought better of it , and went away to the other end of the room , as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a <unk> one .
It so happened that she could not have done a better thing , for Laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him ; and , as she stood at the distant window , with her head half turned , and one hand gathering up her dress , the slender , white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a <unk> statue .
&quot; Good evening , <unk> ! &quot;
said Laurie , with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her .
&quot; Good evening , <unk> ! &quot;
she answered , smiling back at him , for he , too , looked unusually _ <unk> _ , and the thought of <unk> the <unk> on the arm of such a <unk> man caused Amy to pity the four plain <unk> Davis from the bottom of her heart .
&quot; Here are your flowers ; I arranged them myself , remembering that you didn &apos;t like what Hannah calls a &apos; <unk> , &apos; &quot; said Laurie , handing her a delicate <unk> , in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in <unk> &apos;s window .
&#91; Illustration : Here are your flowers &#93; &quot; How kind you are ! &quot;
she exclaimed gratefully .
&quot; If I &apos;d known you were coming I &apos;d have had something ready for you to-day , though not as pretty as this , I &apos;m afraid . &quot;
&quot; Thank you ; it isn &apos;t what it should be , but you have improved it , &quot; he added , as she <unk> the silver bracelet on her <unk> .
&quot; Please don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; I thought you liked that sort of thing ? &quot;
&quot; Not from you ; it doesn &apos;t sound natural , and I like your old <unk> better . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad of it , &quot; he answered , with a look of relief ; then <unk> her gloves for her , and asked if his tie was straight , just as he used to do when they went to parties together , at home .
The company assembled in the long _ <unk> ?
<unk> _ , that evening , was such as one sees <unk> but on the <unk> .
The hospitable Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice , and , having no <unk> against titles , <unk> a few to add <unk> to their Christmas ball .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> to sit in a corner for an hour , and talk with a massive lady , dressed like Hamlet &apos;s mother , in black velvet , with a pearl <unk> under her chin .
A Polish count , <unk> eighteen , devoted himself to the ladies , who pronounced him &quot; a fascinating dear , &quot; and a German <unk> Something , having come for the supper alone , roamed <unk> about , <unk> what he might <unk> .
<unk> <unk> &apos;s private <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , in tight boots , <unk> beamed upon the world , as if his master &apos;s name <unk> him with a golden <unk> ; a stout Frenchman , who knew the <unk> , came to indulge his mania for dancing , and Lady de <unk> , a British <unk> , adorned the scene with her little family of eight .
Of course , there were many <unk> , <unk> American girls , handsome , <unk> English <unk> , and a few plain but <unk> French <unk> ; likewise the usual set of travelling young gentlemen , who <unk> themselves gayly , while <unk> of all nations lined the walls , and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters .
Any young girl can imagine Amy &apos;s state of mind when she &quot; took the stage &quot; that night , leaning on Laurie &apos;s arm .
She knew she looked well , she loved to dance , she felt that her foot was on her native <unk> in a <unk> , and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty , youth , and womanhood .
She did pity the Davis girls , who were awkward , plain , and <unk> of escort , except a grim papa and three <unk> maiden aunts , and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed ; which was good of her , as it permitted them to see her dress , and burn with curiosity to know who her <unk> friend might be .
With the first burst of the band , Amy &apos;s color rose , her eyes began to <unk> , and her feet to tap the floor impatiently ; for she danced well , and wanted Laurie to know it : therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described , when he said , in a perfectly tranquil tone , -- &quot; Do you care to dance ? &quot;
&quot; One usually does at a ball . &quot;
Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to <unk> his <unk> as fast as possible .
&quot; I meant the first dance .
May I have the honor ? &quot;
&quot; I can give you one if I put off the Count .
He dances <unk> ; but he will excuse me , as you are an old friend , &quot; said Amy , hoping that the name would have a good effect , and show Laurie that she was not to be <unk> with .
&quot; Nice little boy , but rather a short <unk> to support &quot; &apos; A daughter of the gods , <unk> tall , and most <unk> fair , &apos; &quot; was all the satisfaction she got , however .
The set in which they found themselves was composed of English , and Amy was <unk> to walk <unk> through a <unk> , feeling all the while as if she could dance the <unk> with a relish .
Laurie resigned her to the &quot; nice little boy , &quot; and went to do his duty to Flo , without <unk> Amy for the joys to come , which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished , for she immediately engaged herself till supper , meaning to <unk> if he then gave any signs of <unk> .
She showed him her <unk> with <unk> satisfaction when he strolled , instead of rushing , up to claim her for the next , a glorious <unk> ; but his polite regrets didn &apos;t <unk> upon her , and when she <unk> away with the Count , she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with an <unk> expression of relief .
That was <unk> ; and Amy took no more notice of him for a long while , except a word now and then , when she came to her <unk> , between the dances , for a necessary pin or a moment &apos;s rest .
Her anger had a good effect , however , for she hid it under a smiling face , and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant .
Laurie &apos;s eyes followed her with pleasure , for she neither <unk> nor <unk> , but danced with spirit and grace , making the <unk> <unk> what it should be .
He very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view ; and , before the evening was half over , had decided that &quot; little Amy was going to make a very charming woman . &quot;
It was a lively scene , for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of every one , and Christmas merriment made all faces shine , hearts happy , and heels light .
The <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> as if they enjoyed it ; everybody danced who could , and those who couldn &apos;t admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth .
The air was dark with <unk> , and many <unk> <unk> like a flock of young <unk> .
The golden <unk> darted through the room like a <unk> , with a dashing Frenchwoman , who <unk> the floor with her pink satin train .
The <unk> <unk> found the <unk> , and was happy , eating steadily through the bill of fare , and <unk> the _ <unk> ? <unk> _ by the <unk> he <unk> .
But the <unk> &apos;s friend covered himself with glory , for he danced everything , whether he knew it or not , and introduced impromptu <unk> when the figures bewildered him .
The boyish <unk> of that stout man was charming to behold ; for , though he &quot; carried weight , &quot; he danced like an <unk> ball .
He ran , he flew , he pranced ; his face glowed , his <unk> head shone ; his <unk> waved wildly , his <unk> actually twinkled in the air , and when the music stopped , he wiped the drops from his brow , and beamed upon his <unk> like a French Pickwick without glasses .
Amy and her <unk> <unk> themselves by equal enthusiasm , but more graceful <unk> ; and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the <unk> rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as <unk> as if <unk> .
When little <unk> finally <unk> her , with assurances that he was &quot; <unk> to leave so early , &quot; she was ready to rest , and see how her <unk> knight had borne his punishment .
It had been successful ; for , at <unk> , blighted affections find a balm in friendly society , and young <unk> will thrill , young blood dance , and healthy young spirits rise , when <unk> to the <unk> of beauty , light , music , and motion .
Laurie had a <unk> look as he rose to give her his seat ; and when he hurried away to bring her some supper , she said to herself , with a satisfied smile , -- &quot; Ah , I thought that would do him good ! &quot;
&quot; You look like <unk> &apos;s &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? me , &apos; &quot; he said , as he <unk> her with one hand , and held her <unk> in the other .
&quot; My <unk> won &apos;t come off ; &quot; and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek , and showed him her white glove with a sober <unk> that made him laugh outright .
&quot; What do you call this stuff ? &quot;
he asked , touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee .
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Good name for it ; it &apos;s very <unk> thing , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s as old as the hills ; you have seen it on <unk> of girls , and you never found out that it was pretty till <unk> _ <unk> _ ! &quot;
&quot; I never saw it on you before , which accounts for the mistake , you see . &quot;
&quot; None of that , it is forbidden ; I &apos;d rather take coffee than compliments just now .
No , don &apos;t <unk> , it makes me nervous . &quot;
Laurie sat <unk> <unk> , and meekly took her empty plate , feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having &quot; little Amy &quot; order him about ; for she had lost her shyness now , and felt an irresistible desire to <unk> on him , as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of <unk> .
&quot; Where did you learn all this sort of thing ? &quot;
he asked , with a <unk> look .
&quot; As &apos; this sort of thing &apos; is rather a vague expression , would you kindly explain ? &quot;
returned Amy , knowing perfectly well what he meant , but <unk> leaving him to describe what is indescribable .
&quot; <unk> general air , the style , the <unk> , <unk> know , &quot; laughed Laurie , breaking down , and helping himself out of his <unk> with the new word .
Amy was gratified , but , of course , didn &apos;t show it , and <unk> answered , &quot; <unk> life <unk> one in spite of one &apos;s self ; I study as well as play ; and as for this &quot; --with a little gesture toward her <unk> &quot; why , <unk> is cheap , <unk> to be had for nothing , and I am used to making the most of my poor little things . &quot;
Amy rather regretted that last sentence , fearing it wasn &apos;t in good taste ; but Laurie liked her the better for it , and found himself both admiring and <unk> the brave patience that made the most of opportunity , and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers .
Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly , nor why he filled up her book with his own name , and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening , in the most delightful manner ; but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new <unk> which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving .
&#91; Illustration : Demi and Daisy &#93; <unk> .
<unk> THE <unk> .
In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married , when &quot; _ <unk> la <unk> ? _ &quot; becomes their motto .
In America , as every one knows , girls early sign the <unk> of independence , and enjoy their freedom with <unk> <unk> ; but the young matrons usually <unk> with the first <unk> to the <unk> , and go into a <unk> almost as close as a French <unk> , though by no means as quiet .
Whether they like it or not , they are <unk> put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over , and most of them might exclaim , as did a very pretty woman the other day , &quot; I &apos;m as handsome as ever , but no one takes any notice of me because I &apos;m married . &quot;
Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady , Meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old , for in her little world <unk> <unk> prevailed , and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever .
As she was a womanly little woman , the maternal instinct was very strong , and she was entirely absorbed in her children , to the utter <unk> of everything and everybody else .
Day and night she <unk> over them with <unk> devotion and anxiety , leaving John to the tender <unk> of the help , for an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen <unk> .
Being a domestic man , John decidedly missed the <unk> attentions he had been accustomed to receive ; but , as he adored his babies , he cheerfully <unk> his comfort for a time , <unk> , with masculine <unk> , that peace would soon be <unk> .
But three months passed , and there was no return of repose ; Meg looked worn and nervous , the babies absorbed every minute of her time , the house was neglected , and Kitty , the cook , who took life &quot; <unk> , &quot; kept him on short <unk> .
When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small <unk> for the captive mamma ; if he came gayly in at night , eager to embrace his family , he was quenched by a &quot; Hush !
they are just asleep after worrying all day . &quot;
If he proposed a little amusement at home , &quot; No , it would disturb the babies . &quot;
If he hinted at a lecture or <unk> , he was answered with a reproachful look , and a decided &quot; Leave my children for pleasure , never ! &quot;
His sleep was broken by infant <unk> and visions of a <unk> figure <unk> noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night ; his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the <unk> genius , who deserted him , <unk> , if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above ; and when he read his paper of an evening , Demi &apos;s <unk> got into the <unk> , and Daisy &apos;s fall affected the price of <unk> , for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news .
The poor man was very uncomfortable , for the children had <unk> him of his wife ; home was merely a nursery , and the perpetual &quot; <unk> &quot; made him feel like a <unk> <unk> whenever he entered the sacred <unk> of <unk> .
He bore it very patiently for six months , and , when no signs of <unk> appeared , he did what other paternal <unk> do , <unk> to get a little comfort elsewhere .
Scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off , and John fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening , when his own parlor was empty , and his own wife singing <unk> that seemed to have no end .
Mrs. Scott was a lively , pretty girl , with nothing to do but be agreeable , and she performed her mission most <unk> .
The parlor was always bright and attractive , the <unk> ready , the piano in tune , plenty of gay gossip , and a nice little supper set forth in <unk> style .
John would have preferred his own <unk> if it had not been so lonely ; but as it was , he gratefully took the next best thing , and enjoyed his neighbor &apos;s society .
Meg rather <unk> of the new arrangement at first , and found it a relief to know that John was having a good time instead of <unk> in the parlor , or tramping about the house and waking the children .
But by and by , when the <unk> worry was over , and the <unk> went to sleep at proper hours , leaving mamma time to rest , she began to miss John , and find her work-basket dull company , when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing-gown , comfortably <unk> his slippers on the <unk> .
She would not ask him to stay at home , but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told , entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain .
She was nervous and worn out with watching and worry , and in that <unk> frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares <unk> them .
Want of exercise <unk> them of cheerfulness , and too much devotion to that idol of American women , the teapot , makes them feel as if they were all <unk> and no <unk> .
&quot; Yes , &quot; she would say , looking in the glass , &quot; I &apos;m getting old and ugly ; John doesn &apos;t find me interesting any longer , so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor , who has no <unk> .
Well , the babies love me ; they don &apos;t care if I am thin and pale , and haven &apos;t time to <unk> my hair ; they are my comfort , and some day John will see what I &apos;ve gladly sacrificed for them , won &apos;t he , my precious ? &quot;
To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a <unk> , or Demi with a crow , and Meg would put by her <unk> for a maternal revel , which soothed her solitude for the time being .
But the pain increased as politics absorbed John , who was always running over to <unk> interesting points with Scott , quite unconscious that Meg missed him .
Not a word did she say , however , till her mother found her in tears one day , and insisted on knowing what the matter was , for Meg &apos;s <unk> spirits had not escaped her observation .
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t tell any one except you , mother ; but I really do need advice , for , if John goes on so much longer I might as well be <unk> , &quot; replied Mrs. Brooke , drying her tears on Daisy &apos;s bib , with an injured air .
&quot; <unk> on how , my dear ? &quot;
asked her mother anxiously .
&quot; He &apos;s away all day , and at night , when I want to see him , he is continually going over to the <unk> &apos; .
It isn &apos;t fair that I should have the <unk> work , and never any amusement .
Men are very selfish , even the best of them . &quot;
&quot; So are women ; don &apos;t blame John till you see where you are wrong yourself . &quot;
&quot; But it can &apos;t be right for him to neglect me . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you neglect him ? &quot;
&quot; Why , mother , I thought you &apos;d take my part ! &quot;
&quot; So I do , as far as <unk> goes ; but I think the fault is yours , Meg . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see how . &quot;
&quot; Let me show you .
Did John ever neglect you , as you call it , while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening , his only leisure time ? &quot;
&quot; No ; but I can &apos;t do it now , with two babies to <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I think you could , dear ; and I think you ought .
May I speak quite freely , and will you remember that it &apos;s mother who <unk> as well as mother who <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Indeed I will !
<unk> to me as if I were little Meg again .
I often feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything . &quot;
Meg drew her low chair beside her mother &apos;s , and , with a little <unk> in either lap , the two women rocked and talked <unk> together , feeling that the tie of <unk> made them more one than ever .
&quot; You have only made the mistake that most young wives make , <unk> your duty to your husband in your love for your children .
A very natural and <unk> mistake , Meg , but one that had better be <unk> before you take to different ways ; for children should draw you nearer than ever , not separate you , as if they were all yours , and John had nothing to do but support them .
I &apos;ve seen it for some weeks , but have not spoken , feeling sure it would come right in time . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid it won &apos;t .
If I ask him to stay , he &apos;ll think I &apos;m jealous ; and I wouldn &apos;t insult him by such an idea .
He doesn &apos;t see that I want him , and I don &apos;t know how to tell him without words . &quot;
&quot; Make it so pleasant he won &apos;t want to go away .
My dear , he &apos;s longing for his little home ; but it isn &apos;t home without you , and you are always in the nursery . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;t I to be there ? &quot;
&quot; Not all the time ; too much confinement makes you nervous , and then you are <unk> for everything .
Besides , you owe something to John as well as to the babies ; don &apos;t neglect husband for children , don &apos;t shut him out of the nursery , but teach him how to help in it .
His place is there as well as yours , and the children need him ; let him feel that he has his part to do , and he will do it gladly and faithfully , and it will be better for you all . &quot;
&quot; You really think so , mother ? &quot;
&quot; I know it , Meg , for I &apos;ve tried it ; and I seldom give advice unless I &apos;ve proved its <unk> .
When you and Jo were little , I went on just as you are , feeling as if I didn &apos;t do my duty unless I devoted myself <unk> to you .
Poor father took to his books , after I had refused all offers of help , and left me to try my experiment alone .
I <unk> along as well as I could , but Jo was too much for me .
I nearly spoilt her by indulgence .
You were poorly , and I worried about you till I fell sick myself .
Then father came to the rescue , quietly managed everything , and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake , and never have been able to get on without him since .
That is the secret of our home happiness : he does not let business <unk> him from the little cares and duties that affect us all , and I try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his <unk> .
Each do our part alone in many things , but at home we work together , always . &quot;
&quot; It is so , mother ; and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours .
<unk> me how ; I &apos;ll do anything you say . &quot;
&quot; You always were my docile daughter .
Well , dear , if I were you , I &apos;d let John have more to do with the management of Demi , for the boy needs training , and it &apos;s none too soon to begin .
Then I &apos;d do what I have often proposed , let Hannah come and help you ; she is a capital nurse , and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more <unk> .
You need the exercise , Hannah would enjoy the rest , and John would find his wife again .
Go out more ; keep cheerful as well as busy , for you are the <unk> of the family , and if you get dismal there is no fair weather .
Then I &apos;d try to take an interest in whatever John likes , <unk> with him , let him read to you , <unk> ideas , and help each other in that way .
Don &apos;t shut yourself up in a <unk> because you are a woman , but understand what is going on , and <unk> yourself to take your part in the world &apos;s work , for it all <unk> you and yours . &quot;
&quot; John is so sensible , I &apos;m afraid he will think I &apos;m stupid if I ask questions about politics and things . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t believe he would ; love covers a <unk> of sins , and of whom could you ask more freely than of him ?
Try it , and see if he doesn &apos;t find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I will .
Poor John !
I &apos;m afraid I _ have _ neglected him sadly , but I thought I was right , and he never said anything . &quot;
&quot; He tried not to be selfish , but he _ has _ felt rather forlorn , I fancy .
This is just the time , Meg , when young married people are apt to grow apart , and the very time when they ought to be most together ; for the first tenderness soon wears off , unless care is taken to preserve it ; and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given them to train .
Don &apos;t let John be a stranger to the babies , for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else , and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should .
Now , dear , good-by ; think over mother &apos;s <unk> , act upon it if it seems good , and God bless you all ! &quot;
Meg did think it over , found it good , and acted upon it , though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it .
Of course the children tyrannized over her , and <unk> the house as soon as they found out that <unk> and <unk> brought them whatever they wanted .
Mamma was an abject slave to their <unk> , but papa was not so easily <unk> , and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal <unk> with his <unk> son .
For Demi <unk> a trifle of his sire &apos;s <unk> of character , <unk> won &apos;t call it obstinacy , --and when he made up his little mind to have or to do anything , all the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men could not change that <unk> little mind .
Mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his <unk> , but papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience ; so <unk> Demi early discovered that when he undertook to &quot; <unk> &quot; with &quot; <unk> , &quot; he always got the worst of it ; yet , like the <unk> , <unk> respected the man who conquered him , and loved the father whose grave &quot; No , no , &quot; was more impressive than all mamma &apos;s <unk> .
A few days after the talk with her mother , Meg resolved to try a social evening with John ; so she ordered a nice supper , set the parlor in order , dressed herself prettily , and put the children to bed early , that nothing should interfere with her experiment .
But , unfortunately , Demi &apos;s most <unk> <unk> was against going to bed , and that night he decided to go on a <unk> ; so poor Meg sung and rocked , told stories and tried every <unk> <unk> she could <unk> , but all in vain , the big eyes wouldn &apos;t shut ; and long after Daisy had gone to <unk> , like the <unk> little bunch of <unk> she was , naughty Demi lay staring at the light , with the most <unk> wide-awake expression of countenance .
&quot; Will Demi lie still like a good boy , while mamma runs down and gives poor papa his tea ? &quot;
asked Meg , as the <unk> softly closed , and the well-known step went <unk> into the dining-room .
&quot; Me has tea ! &quot;
said Demi , preparing to join in the revel .
&quot; No ; but I &apos;ll save you some little <unk> for breakfast , if you &apos;ll go <unk> like Daisy .
Will you , <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
and Demi shut his eyes tight , as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day .
Taking advantage of the <unk> moment , Meg slipped away , and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face , and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration .
He saw it at once , and said , with pleased surprise , -- &quot; Why , little mother , how gay we are to-night .
Do you expect company ? &quot;
&quot; Only you , dear . &quot;
&quot; Is it a birthday , <unk> , or anything ? &quot;
&quot; No ; I &apos;m tired of being a dowdy , so I dressed up as a change .
You always make yourself nice for table , no matter how tired you are ; so why shouldn &apos;t I when I have the time ? &quot;
&quot; I do it out of respect to you , my dear , &quot; said old-fashioned John .
&quot; <unk> , <unk> , Mr. Brooke , &quot; laughed Meg , looking young and pretty again , as she nodded to him over the teapot .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s altogether delightful , and like old times .
This tastes right .
I drink your health , dear . &quot;
And John <unk> his tea with an air of <unk> rapture , which was of very short <unk> , however ; for , as he put down his cup , the <unk> <unk> mysteriously , and a little voice was heard , saying impatiently , -- &quot; <unk> <unk> ; me &apos;s <unk> ! &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s that naughty boy .
I told him to go to sleep alone , and here he is , downstairs , getting his death <unk> <unk> over that <unk> , &quot; said Meg , <unk> the call .
&#91; Illustration : Mornin &apos; now &#93; &quot; Mornin &apos; now , &quot; announced Demi , in a joyful tone , as he entered , with his long <unk> gracefully <unk> over his arm , and every curl <unk> gayly as he pranced about the table , eying the &quot; <unk> &quot; with loving glances .
&quot; No , it isn &apos;t morning yet .
You must go to bed , and not trouble poor mamma ; then you can have the little cake with sugar on it . &quot;
&quot; Me loves <unk> , &quot; said the artful one , preparing to climb the paternal knee , and revel in forbidden joys .
But John shook his head , and said to Meg , -- &quot; If you told him to stay up there , and go to sleep alone , make him do it , or he will never learn to mind you . &quot;
&quot; Yes , of course .
Come , Demi ; &quot; and Meg led her son away , feeling a strong desire to <unk> the little <unk> who <unk> beside her , laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery .
Nor was he disappointed ; for that short-sighted woman actually gave him a <unk> of sugar , tucked him into his bed , and forbade any more promenades till morning .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
said Demi the <unk> , <unk> <unk> his sugar , and regarding his first attempt as <unk> successful .
Meg returned to her place , and supper was <unk> pleasantly , when the little ghost walked again , and <unk> the maternal <unk> by boldly demanding , -- &quot; More <unk> , marmar . &quot;
&quot; Now this won &apos;t do , &quot; said John , <unk> his heart against the engaging little sinner .
&quot; We shall never know any peace till that child <unk> to go to bed properly .
You have made a slave of yourself long enough ; give him one lesson , and then there will be an end of it .
Put him in his bed and leave him , Meg . &quot;
&quot; He won &apos;t stay there ; he never does , unless I sit by him . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll manage him .
Demi , go upstairs , and get into your bed , as mamma <unk> you . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
replied the young rebel , helping himself to the coveted &quot; <unk> , &quot; and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity .
&quot; You must never say that to papa ; I shall carry you if you don &apos;t go yourself . &quot;
&quot; Go &apos; way ; me don &apos;t love <unk> ; &quot; and Demi retired to his mother &apos;s skirts for protection .
But even that refuge proved <unk> , for he was delivered over to the enemy , with a &quot; Be gentle with him , John , &quot; which struck the culprit with dismay ; for when mamma deserted him , then the <unk> was at hand .
<unk> of his cake , <unk> of his frolic , and borne away by a strong hand to that <unk> bed , poor Demi could not restrain his wrath , but openly defied papa , and <unk> and screamed <unk> all the way upstairs .
The minute he was put into bed on one side , he rolled out on the other , and made for the door , only to be <unk> caught up by the tail of his little <unk> , and put back again , which lively performance was kept up till the young man &apos;s strength gave out , when he devoted himself to <unk> at the top of his voice .
This <unk> exercise usually conquered Meg ; but John sat as <unk> as the post which is <unk> believed to be deaf .
No <unk> , no sugar , no <unk> , no story ; even the light was put out , and only the red glow of the fire <unk> the &quot; big dark &quot; which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear .
This new order of things disgusted him , and he <unk> dismally for &quot; marmar , &quot; as his angry passions subsided , and <unk> of his tender <unk> returned to the captive <unk> .
The plaintive <unk> which succeeded the passionate <unk> went to Meg &apos;s heart , and she ran up to say <unk> , -- &quot; Let me stay with him ; he &apos;ll be good , now , John . &quot;
&quot; No , my dear , I &apos;ve told him he must go to sleep , as you bid him ; and he must , if I stay here all night . &quot;
&quot; But he &apos;ll cry himself sick , &quot; pleaded Meg , <unk> herself for <unk> her boy .
&quot; No , he won &apos;t , he &apos;s so tired he will soon drop off , and then the matter is settled ; for he will understand that he has got to mind .
Don &apos;t interfere ; I &apos;ll manage him . &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s my child , and I can &apos;t have his spirit broken by <unk> . &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s my child , and I won &apos;t have his temper spoilt by indulgence .
Go down , my dear , and leave the boy to me . &quot;
When John spoke in that <unk> tone , Meg always obeyed , and never regretted her <unk> .
&quot; Please let me kiss him once , John ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> .
Demi , say &apos; good-night &apos; to mamma , and let her go and rest , for she is very tired with taking care of you all day . &quot;
Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the <unk> ; for after it was given , Demi sobbed more quietly , and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed , whither he had <unk> in his anguish of mind .
&quot; Poor little man , he &apos;s worn out with sleep and crying .
I &apos;ll cover him up , and then go and set Meg &apos;s heart at rest , &quot; thought John , <unk> to the bedside , hoping to find his rebellious <unk> asleep .
But he wasn &apos;t ; for the moment his father peeped at him , Demi &apos;s eyes opened , his little chin began to quiver , and he put up his arms , saying , with a penitent <unk> , &quot; Me &apos;s <unk> , now . &quot;
Sitting on the stairs , outside , Meg wondered at the long silence which followed the <unk> ; and , after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents , she slipped into the room , to set her fears at rest .
Demi lay fast asleep ; not in his usual <unk> attitude , but in a subdued bunch , cuddled close in the circle of his father &apos;s arm and holding his father &apos;s finger , as if he felt that justice was <unk> with mercy , and had gone to sleep a <unk> and a wiser baby .
So held , John had waited with womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold ; and , while waiting , had fallen asleep , more tired by that <unk> with his son than with his whole day &apos;s work .
As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow , she smiled to herself , and then slipped away again , saying , in a satisfied tone , -- &quot; I never need fear that John will be too <unk> with my babies : he _ does _ know how to manage them , and will be a great help , for Demi _ is _ getting too much for me . &quot;
When John came down at last , expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife , he was <unk> surprised to find Meg <unk> trimming a bonnet , and to be greeted with the request to read something about the <unk> , if he was not too tired .
John saw in a minute that a <unk> of some kind was going on , but wisely asked no questions , knowing that Meg was such a <unk> little person , she couldn &apos;t keep a secret to save her life , and therefore the <unk> would soon appear .
He read a long <unk> with the most amiable <unk> , and then explained it in his most <unk> manner , while Meg tried to look deeply interested , to ask intelligent questions , and keep her thoughts from <unk> from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet .
In her secret soul , however , she decided that politics were as bad as <unk> , and that the mission of <unk> seemed to be calling each other names ; but she kept these feminine ideas to herself , and when John paused , shook her head , and said with what she thought <unk> <unk> , -- &quot; Well , I really don &apos;t see what we are coming to . &quot;
John laughed , and watched her for a minute , as she <unk> a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand , and regarded it with the genuine interest which his <unk> had failed to <unk> .
&quot; She is trying to like politics for my sake , so I &apos;ll try and like <unk> for hers , that &apos;s only fair , &quot; thought John the Just , adding aloud , -- &quot; That &apos;s very pretty ; is it what you call a <unk> ? &quot;
&#91; Illustration : My dear man , it &apos;s a bonnet &#93; &quot; My dear man , it &apos;s a bonnet !
My very best <unk> bonnet . &quot;
&quot; I beg your pardon ; it was so small , I naturally <unk> it for one of the fly-away things you sometimes wear .
How do you keep it on ? &quot;
&quot; These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a <unk> , so ; &quot; and Meg <unk> by putting on the bonnet , and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible .
&quot; It &apos;s a love of a bonnet , but I prefer the face inside , for it looks young and happy again , &quot; and John kissed the smiling face , to the great <unk> of the <unk> under the chin .
&quot; I &apos;m glad you like it , for I want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night ; I really need some music to put me in tune .
Will you , please ? &quot;
&quot; Of course I will , with all my heart , or anywhere else you like .
You have been shut up so long , it will do you no end of good , and I shall enjoy it , of all things .
What put it into your head , little mother ? &quot;
&quot; Well , I had a talk with Marmee the other day , and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts I felt , and she said I needed change and less care ; so Hannah is to help me with the children , and I &apos;m to see to things about the house more , and now and then have a little fun , just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety , <unk> old woman before my time .
It &apos;s only an experiment , John , and I want to try it for your sake as much as for mine , because I &apos;ve neglected you <unk> lately , and I &apos;m going to make home what it used to be , if I can .
You don &apos;t object , I hope ? &quot;
Never mind what John said , or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin ; all that we have any business to know , is that John did _ not _ appear to object , judging from the changes which gradually took place in the house and its <unk> .
It was not all <unk> by any means , but every one was better for the <unk> of labor <unk> ; the children <unk> under the paternal rule , for <unk> , <unk> John brought order and obedience into <unk> , while Meg recovered her spirits and composed her <unk> by plenty of wholesome exercise , a little pleasure , and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband .
Home grew <unk> again , and John had no wish to leave it , unless he took Meg with him .
The <unk> came to the <unk> &apos; now , and every one found the little house a cheerful place , full of happiness , content , and family love .
Even gay Sallie <unk> liked to go there .
&quot; It is always so quiet and pleasant here ; it does me good , Meg , &quot; she used to say , looking about her with wistful eyes , as if trying to discover the charm , that she might use it in her great house , full of splendid loneliness ; for there were no riotous , <unk> babies there , and Ned lived in a world of his own , where there was no place for her .
This household happiness did not come all at once , but John and Meg had found the key to it , and each year of married life taught them how to use it , <unk> the <unk> of real <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which the <unk> may possess , and the <unk> cannot buy .
This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid , safe from the restless fret and fever of the world , finding <unk> lovers in the little <unk> and daughters who cling to them , <unk> by sorrow , poverty , or age ; walking side by side , through fair and stormy weather , with a faithful friend , who is , in the true sense of the good old <unk> word , the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and learning , as Meg learned , that a woman &apos;s happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor the art of <unk> it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother .

<unk> LAURENCE .
Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week , and remained a month .
He was tired of <unk> about alone , and Amy &apos;s familiar presence seemed to give a <unk> charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part .
He rather missed the &quot; petting &quot; he used to receive , and enjoyed a taste of it again ; for no attentions , however flattering , from strangers , were half so pleasant as the sisterly <unk> of the girls at home .
Amy never would pet him like the others , but she was very glad to see him now , and quite clung to him , feeling that he was the <unk> of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess .
They naturally took comfort in each other &apos;s society , and were much together , riding , walking , dancing , or <unk> , for , at Nice , no one can be very <unk> during the gay season .
But , while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion , they were <unk> making discoveries and <unk> <unk> about each other .
Amy rose daily in the <unk> of her friend , but he <unk> in hers , and each felt the truth before a word was spoken .
Amy tried to please , and succeeded , for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her , and <unk> him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm .
Laurie made no effort of any kind , but just let himself <unk> along as comfortably as possible , trying to forget , and feeling that all women <unk> him a kind word because one had been cold to him .
It cost him no effort to be generous , and he would have given Amy all the <unk> in Nice if she would have taken them ; but , at the same time , he felt that he could not change the opinion she was <unk> of him , and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such <unk> , <unk> surprise .
&quot; All the rest have gone to <unk> for the day ; I preferred to stay at home and write letters .
They are done now , and I am going to Valrosa to sketch ; will you come ? &quot;
said Amy , as she joined Laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual , about <unk> .
&quot; Well , yes ; but isn &apos;t it rather warm for such a long walk ? &quot;
he answered slowly , for the <unk> _ salon _ looked inviting , after the <unk> without .
&quot; I &apos;m going to have the little carriage , and <unk> can drive , so you &apos;ll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves nice , &quot; returned Amy , with a <unk> glance at the <unk> <unk> , which were a weak point with Laurie .
&quot; Then I &apos;ll go with pleasure ; &quot; and he put out his hand for her sketch-book .
But she tucked it under her arm with a <unk> &quot; Don &apos;t trouble yourself ; it &apos;s no <unk> to me , but _ you _ don &apos;t look equal to it . &quot;
Laurie lifted his eyebrows , and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs ; but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself , and left little <unk> nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch .
The two never <unk> , <unk> was too well-bred , and just now Laurie was too lazy ; so , in a minute he peeped under her <unk> with an inquiring air ; she answered with a smile , and they went on together in the most <unk> manner .
It was a lovely drive , along <unk> <unk> rich in the picturesque scenes that delight <unk> eyes .
Here an ancient <unk> , <unk> the solemn chanting of the <unk> came down to them .
There a <unk> <unk> , in wooden shoes , pointed hat , and rough <unk> over one shoulder , sat piping on a stone , while his goats skipped among the <unk> or lay at his feet .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> of <unk> grass , passed by , with a pretty girl in a _ <unk> _ sitting between the green piles , or an old woman spinning with a <unk> as she went .
Brown , <unk> children ran out from the quaint stone <unk> to offer <unk> , or <unk> of <unk> still on the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> covered the hills with their <unk> <unk> , fruit hung golden in the orchard , and great scarlet <unk> <unk> the <unk> ; while beyond green <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky .
Valrosa well deserved its name , for , in that <unk> of perpetual summer , roses blossomed everywhere .
They <unk> the <unk> , <unk> themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to <unk> , and lined the <unk> , <unk> through <unk> and <unk> <unk> up to the <unk> on the hill .
Every <unk> <unk> , where seats invited one to stop and rest , was a <unk> of bloom ; every cool <unk> had its marble <unk> smiling from a veil of flowers , and every fountain reflected crimson , white , or pale pink roses , leaning down to smile at their own beauty .
<unk> covered the walls of the house , draped the <unk> , climbed the <unk> , and ran <unk> over the <unk> of the wide terrace , <unk> one looked down on the sunny <unk> , and the <unk> city on its shore .
&quot; This is a regular honeymoon <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
Did you ever see such roses ? &quot;
asked Amy , pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view , and a luxurious <unk> of <unk> that came <unk> by .
&quot; No , nor felt such thorns , &quot; returned Laurie , with his <unk> in his mouth , after a vain attempt to <unk> a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach .
&quot; Try lower down , and pick those that have no thorns , &quot; said Amy , gathering three of the tiny <unk> ones that <unk> the wall behind her .
She put them in his button-hole , as a <unk> , and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression , for in the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of <unk> , and he was just then in that state of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , when <unk> young men find <unk> in trifles , and food for romance everywhere .
He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny red rose , for <unk> flowers became her , and she had often worn ones like that from the <unk> at home .
The pale roses Amy gave him were the sort that the <unk> lay in dead hands , never in bridal <unk> , and , for a moment , he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself ; but the next instant his American <unk> got the better of <unk> , and he laughed a <unk> laugh than Amy had heard since he came .
&quot; It &apos;s good advice ; you &apos;d better take it and save your fingers , &quot; she said , thinking her speech amused him .
&quot; Thank you , I will , &quot; he answered in <unk> , and a few months later he did it in earnest .
&quot; Laurie , when are you going to your grandfather ? &quot;
she asked presently , as she settled herself on a <unk> seat .
&quot; Very soon . &quot;
&quot; You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks . &quot;
&quot; I dare say ; short answers save trouble . &quot;
&quot; He <unk> you , and you really ought to go . &quot;
&quot; <unk> creature !
I know it . &quot;
&quot; Then why don &apos;t you do it ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> , I suppose . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> , you mean .
It &apos;s really dreadful ! &quot;
and Amy looked severe .
&quot; Not so bad as it seems , for I should only plague him if I went , so I might as well stay , and plague you a little longer , you can bear it better ; in fact , I think it <unk> with you excellently ; &quot; and Laurie composed himself for a <unk> on the broad <unk> of the <unk> .
Amy shook her head , and opened her sketch-book with an air of resignation ; but she had made up her mind to lecture &quot; that boy , &quot; and in a minute she began again .
&quot; What are you doing just now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; No , no ; I mean what do you intend and wish to do ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> a <unk> , if you &apos;ll allow me . &quot;
&quot; How provoking you are !
I don &apos;t approve of <unk> , and I will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch ; I need a figure . &quot;
&quot; With all the pleasure in life .
How will you have me , <unk> or <unk> , on my head or my heels ?
I should respectfully suggest a <unk> <unk> , then put yourself in also , and call it &apos; _ <unk> far <unk> . _ &apos; &quot; &quot; <unk> as you are , and go to sleep if you like .
_ I _ intend to work hard , &quot; said Amy , in her most energetic tone .
&quot; What delightful enthusiasm ! &quot;
and he leaned against a tall <unk> with an air of entire satisfaction .
&quot; What would Jo say if she saw you now ? &quot;
asked Amy impatiently , hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister &apos;s name .
&quot; As usual , &apos; Go away , Teddy , I &apos;m busy ! &apos; &quot;
He laughed as he spoke , but the laugh was not natural , and a shade passed over his face , for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not <unk> yet .
Both tone and shadow struck Amy , for she had seen and heard them before , and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on Laurie &apos;s face , --a hard , bitter look , full of pain , <unk> , and regret .
It was gone before she could study it , and the listless expression back again .
She watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure , thinking how like an Italian he looked , as he lay <unk> in the sun with <unk> head , and eyes full of <unk> <unk> ; for he seemed to have forgotten her , and fallen into a reverie .
&quot; You look like the <unk> of a young knight asleep on his tomb , &quot; she said , carefully <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> against the dark stone .
&quot; Wish I was ! &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s a foolish wish , unless you have spoilt your life .
You are so changed , I sometimes <unk> &quot; there Amy stopped , with a <unk> , <unk> look , more <unk> than her unfinished speech .
Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she <unk> to express , and looking straight into her eyes , said , just as he used to say it to her mother , -- &quot; It &apos;s all right , ma &apos;am . &quot;
That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately .
It also touched her , and she showed that it did , by the cordial tone in which she said , -- &quot; I &apos;m glad of that !
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d been a very bad boy , but I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked <unk> , lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband , or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour .
Don &apos;t stay out there in the sun ; come and lie on the grass here , and &apos; let us be friendly , &apos; as Jo used to say when we got in the <unk> and told secrets . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Laurie threw himself down on the turf &#93; Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf , and began to amuse himself by <unk> <unk> into the ribbons of Amy &apos;s hat , that lay there .
&quot; I &apos;m all ready for the secrets ; &quot; and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes .
&quot; I &apos;ve none to tell ; you may begin . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;t one to bless myself with .
I thought perhaps you &apos;d had some news from home . &quot;
&quot; You have heard all that has come lately .
Don &apos;t you hear often ?
I fancied Jo would send you volumes . &quot;
&quot; She &apos;s very busy ; I &apos;m <unk> about so , it &apos;s impossible to be regular , you know .
When do you begin your great work of art , <unk> ? &quot;
he asked , changing the subject abruptly after another pause , in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his secret , and wanted to talk about it .
&quot; Never , &quot; she answered , with a despondent but decided air .
&quot; Rome took all the vanity out of me ; for after seeing the <unk> there , I felt too <unk> to live , and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair . &quot;
&quot; Why should you , with so much energy and talent ? &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s just why , <unk> talent isn &apos;t genius , and no amount of energy can make it so .
I want to be great , or nothing .
I won &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> , so I don &apos;t intend to try any more . &quot;
&quot; And what are you going to do with yourself now , if I may ask ? &quot;
&quot; Polish up my other <unk> , and be an ornament to society , if I get the chance . &quot;
It was a characteristic speech , and sounded daring ; but audacity becomes young people , and Amy &apos;s ambition had a good <unk> .
Laurie smiled , but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a <unk> one died , and spent no time <unk> .
&quot; Good !
and here is where Fred Vaughn comes in , I fancy . &quot;
Amy <unk> a <unk> silence , but there was a conscious look in her downcast face , that made Laurie sit up and say gravely , -- &quot; Now I &apos;m going to play brother , and ask questions .
May I ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t promise to answer . &quot;
&quot; Your face will , if your tongue won &apos;t .
You aren &apos;t woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings , my dear .
I heard <unk> about Fred and you last year , and it &apos;s my private opinion that , if he had not been called home so suddenly and <unk> so long , something would have come of <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s not for me to say , &quot; was Amy &apos;s prim reply ; but her lips would smile , and there was a <unk> <unk> of the eye , which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge .
&quot; You are not engaged , I hope ? &quot;
and Laurie looked very <unk> and grave all of a sudden .
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; But you will be , if he comes back and goes properly down upon his knees , won &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Very likely . &quot;
&quot; Then you are fond of old Fred ? &quot;
&quot; I could be , if I tried . &quot;
&quot; But you don &apos;t intend to try till the proper moment ?
Bless my soul , what <unk> <unk> !
He &apos;s a good fellow , Amy , but not the man I fancied you &apos;d like . &quot;
&quot; He is rich , a gentleman , and has delightful manners , &quot; began Amy , trying to be quite cool and dignified , but feeling a little ashamed of herself , in spite of the <unk> of her intentions .
&quot; I understand ; <unk> of society can &apos;t get on without money , so you mean to make a good match , and start in that way ?
Quite right and proper , as the world goes , but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother &apos;s girls . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , nevertheless . &quot;
A short speech , but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young <unk> .
Laurie felt this instinctively , and laid himself down again , with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain .
His look and silence , as well as a certain <unk> <unk> , ruffled Amy , and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay .
&quot; I wish you &apos;d do me the favor to <unk> yourself a little , &quot; she said sharply .
&quot; Do it for me , there &apos;s a dear girl . &quot;
&quot; I could , if I tried ; &quot; and she looked as if she would like doing it in the most <unk> style .
&quot; Try , then ; I give you leave , &quot; returned Laurie , who enjoyed having some one to tease , after his long <unk> from his favorite <unk> .
&quot; You &apos;d be angry in five minutes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m never angry with you .
It takes two <unk> to make a fire : you are as cool and soft as snow . &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t know what I can do ; snow <unk> a glow and a <unk> , if <unk> rightly .
Your indifference is half <unk> , and a good stirring up would prove it . &quot;
&quot; <unk> away ; it won &apos;t hurt me and it may amuse you , as the big man said when his little wife beat him .
<unk> me in the light of a husband or a carpet , and beat till you are tired , if that sort of exercise <unk> with you . &quot;
Being decidedly nettled herself , and longing to see him shake off the <unk> that so altered him , Amy <unk> both tongue and pencil , and began : -- &quot; Flo and I have got a new name for you ; it &apos;s &apos; <unk> Laurence . &apos;
How do you like it ? &quot;
She thought it would <unk> him ; but he only folded his arms under his head , with an <unk> &quot; That &apos;s not bad .
Thank you , ladies . &quot;
&quot; Do you want to know what I honestly think of you ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> to be told . &quot;
&quot; Well , I <unk> you . &quot;
If she had even said &quot; I hate you , &quot; in a <unk> or coquettish tone , he would have laughed , and rather liked it ; but the grave , almost sad , accent of her voice made him open his eyes , and ask quickly , -- &quot; Why , if you please ? &quot;
&quot; Because , with every chance for being good , useful , and happy , you are <unk> , lazy , and miserable . &quot;
&quot; <unk> language , mademoiselle . &quot;
&quot; If you like it , I &apos;ll go on . &quot;
&quot; Pray , do ; it &apos;s quite interesting . &quot;
&quot; I thought you &apos;d find it so ; selfish people always like to talk about themselves . &quot;
&quot; Am _ I _ selfish ? &quot;
The question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise , for the one virtue on which he prided himself was <unk> .
&quot; Yes , very selfish , &quot; continued Amy , in a calm , cool voice , twice as effective , just then , as an angry one .
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how , for I &apos;ve studied you while we have been <unk> , and I &apos;m not at all satisfied with you .
Here you have been abroad nearly six months , and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends . &quot;
&quot; Isn &apos;t a fellow to have any pleasure after a <unk> grind ? &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t look as if you &apos;d had much ; at any rate , you are none the better for it , as far as I can see .
I said , when we first met , that you had improved .
Now I take it all back , for I don &apos;t think you half so nice as when I left you at home .
You have grown <unk> lazy ; you like gossip , and waste time on frivolous things ; you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people , instead of being loved and respected by wise ones .
With money , talent , position , health , and beauty , <unk> , you like that , Old <unk> !
but it &apos;s the truth , so I can &apos;t help saying it , --with all these splendid things to use and enjoy , you can find nothing to do but dawdle ; and , instead of being the man you might and ought to be , you are <unk> &quot; There she stopped , with a look that had both pain and pity in it .
&quot; Saint Laurence on a <unk> , &quot; added Laurie , blandly finishing the sentence .
But the lecture began to take effect , for there was a wide-awake <unk> in his eyes now , and a <unk> , <unk> expression replaced the former indifference .
&quot; I supposed you &apos;d take it so .
You men tell us we are angels , and say we can make you what we will ; but the instant we honestly try to do you good , you laugh at us , and won &apos;t listen , which <unk> how much your <unk> is worth . &quot;
Amy spoke bitterly , and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet .
In a minute a hand came down over the page , so that she could not draw , and Laurie &apos;s voice said , with a droll imitation of a penitent child , -- &quot; I will be good , oh , I will be good ! &quot;
But Amy did not laugh , for she was in earnest ; and , <unk> on the <unk> hand with her pencil , said soberly , -- &quot; Aren &apos;t you ashamed of a hand like that ?
It &apos;s as soft and white as a woman &apos;s , and looks as if it never did anything but wear <unk> &apos;s best gloves , and pick flowers for ladies .
You are not a <unk> , thank <unk> !
so I &apos;m glad to see there are no diamonds or big <unk> on it , only the little old one Jo gave you so long ago .
Dear soul , I wish she was here to help me ! &quot;
&quot; So do I ! &quot;
The hand vanished as suddenly as it came , and there was energy enough in the <unk> of her wish to suit even Amy .
She glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind ; but he was lying with his hat half over his face , as if for shade , and his <unk> hid his mouth .
She only saw his chest rise and fall , with a long breath that might have been a sigh , and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass , as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of .
All in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and <unk> in Amy &apos;s mind , and told her what her sister never had confided to her .
She remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo ; she recalled the shadow on his face just now , the change in his character , and the wearing of the little old ring , which was no ornament to a handsome hand .
Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence .
Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the <unk> , and now she was sure of it .
Her keen eyes filled , and , when she spoke again , it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so .
&quot; I know I have no right to talk so to you , Laurie ; and if you weren &apos;t the <unk> fellow in the world , you &apos;d be very angry with me .
But we are all so fond and proud of you , I couldn &apos;t bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as I have been , though , perhaps , they would understand the change better than I do . &quot;
&quot; I think they would , &quot; came from under the hat , in a grim tone , quite as touching as a broken one .
&quot; They ought to have told me , and not let me go <unk> and scolding , when I should have been more kind and patient than ever .
I never did like that Miss Randal , and now I hate her ! &quot;
said artful Amy , wishing to be sure of her facts this time .
&quot; Hang Miss Randal ! &quot;
and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his <unk> toward that young lady .
&quot; I beg pardon ; I <unk> &quot; and there she paused <unk> .
&quot; No , you didn &apos;t ; you knew perfectly well I never cared for any one but Jo . &quot;
Laurie said that in his old , impetuous tone , and turned his face away as he spoke .
&quot; I did think so ; but as they never said anything about it , and you came away , I supposed I was mistaken .
And Jo wouldn &apos;t be kind to you ?
Why , I was sure she loved you dearly . &quot;
&quot; She _ was _ kind , but not in the right way ; and it &apos;s lucky for her she didn &apos;t love me , if I &apos;m the <unk> fellow you think me .
It &apos;s her fault , though , and you may tell her so . &quot;
The hard , bitter look came back again as he said that , and it troubled Amy , for she did not know what balm to <unk> .
&quot; I was wrong , I didn &apos;t know .
I &apos;m very sorry I was so cross , but I can &apos;t help wishing you &apos;d bear it better , Teddy , dear . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t , that &apos;s her name for me ! &quot;
and Laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo &apos;s <unk> , <unk> tone .
&quot; Wait till you &apos;ve tried it yourself , &quot; he added , in a low voice , as he pulled up the grass by the handful .
&quot; I &apos;d take it manfully , and be respected if I couldn &apos;t be loved , &quot; said Amy , with the decision of one who knew nothing about it .
Now , Laurie flattered himself that he _ had _ borne it remarkably well , making no moan , asking no sympathy , and taking his trouble away to live it down alone .
Amy &apos;s lecture put the matter in a new light , and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure , and shut himself up in moody indifference .
He felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream , and found it impossible to go to sleep again .
Presently he sat up , and asked slowly , -- &quot; Do you think Jo would <unk> me as you do ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , if she saw you now .
She hates lazy people .
Why don &apos;t you do something splendid , and _ make _ her love you ? &quot;
&quot; I did my best , but it was no use . &quot;
&quot; <unk> well , you mean ?
That was no more than you ought to have done , for your grandfather &apos;s sake .
It would have been <unk> to fail after spending so much time and money , when every one knew you _ could _ do well . &quot;
&quot; I did fail , say what you will , for Jo wouldn &apos;t love me , &quot; began Laurie , leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude .
&quot; No , you didn &apos;t , and you &apos;ll say so in the end , for it did you good , and proved that you could do something if you tried .
If you &apos;d only set about another task of some sort , you &apos;d soon be your hearty , happy self again , and forget your trouble . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s impossible . &quot;
&quot; Try it and see .
You needn &apos;t shrug your shoulders , and think , &apos; Much she knows about such things . &apos;
I don &apos;t <unk> to be wise , but I _ am _ observing , and I see a great deal more than you &apos;d imagine .
I &apos;m interested in other people &apos;s experiences and <unk> ; and , though I can &apos;t explain , I remember and use them for my own benefit .
Love Jo all your days , if you choose , but don &apos;t let it spoil you , for it &apos;s wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can &apos;t have the one you want .
There , I won &apos;t lecture any more , for I know you &apos;ll wake up and be a man in spite of that <unk> girl . &quot;
Neither spoke for several minutes .
Laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger , and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked .
Presently she put it on his knee , merely saying , -- &quot; How do you like that ? &quot;
He looked and then he smiled , as he could not well help doing , for it was capitally done , --the long , lazy figure on the grass , with listless face , <unk> eyes , and one hand holding a cigar , from which came the little wreath of smoke that <unk> the <unk> &apos;s head .
&quot; How well you draw ! &quot;
he said , with genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill , adding , with a <unk> , -- &quot; Yes , that &apos;s me . &quot;
&quot; As you are : this is as you were ; &quot; and Amy laid another sketch beside the one he held .
It was not nearly so well done , but there was a life and spirit in it which <unk> for many faults , and it recalled the past so <unk> that a sudden change swept over the young man &apos;s face as he looked .
Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse ; hat and coat were off , and every line of the active figure , resolute face , and commanding attitude , was full of energy and meaning .
The handsome <unk> , just subdued , stood <unk> his neck under the tightly drawn <unk> , with one foot impatiently <unk> the ground , and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had <unk> him .
In the ruffled mane , the <unk> &apos;s <unk> hair and erect attitude , there was a <unk> of suddenly arrested motion , of strength , courage , and youthful <unk> , that contrasted sharply with the <unk> grace of the &quot; _ <unk> far <unk> _ &quot; sketch .
Laurie said nothing ; but , as his eye went from one to the other , Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him .
That satisfied her ; and , without waiting for him to speak , she said , in her sprightly way , -- &#91; Illustration : A rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse &#93; &quot; Don &apos;t you remember the day you played <unk> with <unk> , and we all looked on ?
Meg and Beth were frightened , but Jo clapped and pranced , and I sat on the fence and drew you .
I found that sketch in my portfolio the other day , touched it up , and kept it to show you . &quot;
&quot; Much obliged .
You &apos;ve improved immensely since then , and I congratulate you .
May I venture to suggest in &apos; a honeymoon <unk> &apos; that five o &apos;clock is the <unk> at your <unk> ? &quot;
Laurie rose as he spoke , returned the pictures with a smile and a bow , and looked at his watch , as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end .
He tried to <unk> his former easy , indifferent air , but it _ was _ an <unk> now , for the rousing had been more <unk> than he would confess .
Amy felt the shade of <unk> in his manner , and said to herself , -- &quot; Now I &apos;ve offended him .
Well , if it does him good , I &apos;m glad ; if it makes him hate me , I &apos;m sorry ; but it &apos;s true , and I can &apos;t take back a word of it . &quot;
They laughed and chatted all the way home ; and little <unk> , up behind , thought that <unk> and mademoiselle were in charming spirits .
But both felt ill at ease ; the friendly frankness was disturbed , the sunshine had a shadow over it , and <unk> their <unk> <unk> , there was a secret <unk> in the heart of each .
&quot; Shall we see you this evening , _ <unk> <unk> ? <unk> _ ? &quot;
asked Amy as they parted at her aunt &apos;s door .
&quot; Unfortunately I have an engagement .
_ <unk> <unk> , mademoiselle _ , &quot; and Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand , in the foreign fashion , which became him better than many men .
Something in his face made Amy say quickly and warmly , -- &quot; No ; be yourself with me , Laurie , and part in the good old way .
I &apos;d rather have a hearty English <unk> than all the sentimental <unk> in France . &quot;
&quot; Good-by , dear , &quot; and with these words , uttered in the tone she liked , Laurie left her , after a <unk> almost painful in its <unk> .
Next morning , instead of the usual call , Amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end : -- &quot; MY DEAR <unk> , -- &quot; Please make my <unk> to your aunt , and exult within yourself , for &apos; <unk> Laurence &apos; has gone to his grandpa , like the best of boys .
A pleasant winter to you , and may the gods <unk> you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa !
I think Fred would be <unk> by a <unk> .
Tell him so , with my congratulations .
&quot; Yours gratefully , <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Good boy !
I &apos;m glad he &apos;s gone , &quot; said Amy , with an approving smile ; the next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room , adding , with an <unk> sigh , -- &quot; Yes , I _ am _ glad , but how I shall miss him ! &quot;

THE VALLEY OF THE <unk> .
When the first bitterness was over , the family accepted the <unk> , and tried to bear it cheerfully , helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind <unk> tenderly together in times of trouble .
They put away their grief , and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one .
The <unk> room in the house was set apart for Beth , and in it was gathered everything that she most loved , <unk> , pictures , her piano , the little <unk> , and the beloved <unk> .
Father &apos;s best books found their way there , mother &apos;s easy-chair , Jo &apos;s desk , Amy &apos;s finest sketches ; and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage , to make sunshine for <unk> Beth .
John quietly set apart a little sum , that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for ; old Hannah never wearied of <unk> dainty dishes to <unk> a <unk> appetite , dropping tears as she worked ; and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters , seeming to bring <unk> of warmth and <unk> from <unk> that know no winter .
Here , cherished like a household saint in its shrine , sat Beth , tranquil and busy as ever ; for nothing could change the sweet , unselfish nature , and even while preparing to leave life , she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind .
The feeble fingers were never idle , and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the <unk> daily passing to and fro , --to drop a pair of <unk> from her window for a pair of purple hands , a <unk> for some small mother of many dolls , <unk> for young <unk> <unk> through <unk> of <unk> , <unk> for <unk> eyes , and all manner of pleasant devices , till the <unk> <unk> up the ladder of learning found their way <unk> with flowers , as it were , and came to regard the gentle <unk> as a sort of fairy <unk> , who sat above there , and <unk> down gifts <unk> suited to their tastes and needs .
If Beth had wanted any reward , she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window , with nods and smiles , and the droll little letters which came to her , full of <unk> and gratitude .
The first few months were very happy ones , and Beth often used to look round , and say &quot; How beautiful this is ! &quot;
as they all sat together in her sunny room , the babies <unk> and <unk> on the floor , mother and sisters working near , and father reading , in his pleasant voice , from the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words , as applicable now as when written <unk> ago ; a little chapel , where a paternal <unk> taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn , trying to show them that hope can comfort love , and faith make resignation possible .
Simple sermons , that went straight to the souls of those who listened ; for the father &apos;s heart was in the minister &apos;s religion , and the frequent <unk> in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read .
It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come ; for , by and by , Beth said the needle was &quot; so heavy , &quot; and put it down forever ; talking wearied her , faces troubled her , pain <unk> her for its own , and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the <unk> that <unk> her feeble flesh .
Ah me !
such heavy days , such long , long <unk> , such aching hearts and imploring prayers , when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them <unk> , to hear the bitter cry , &quot; <unk> me , help me ! &quot;
and to feel that there was no help .
A sad <unk> of the serene soul , a sharp struggle of the young life with death ; but both were <unk> brief , and then , the natural <unk> over , the old peace returned more beautiful than ever .
With the wreck of her frail body , Beth &apos;s soul grew strong ; and , though she said little , those about her felt that she was ready , saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the <unk> , and waited with her on the shore , trying to see the <unk> <unk> coming to receive her when she <unk> the river .
Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said , &quot; I feel stronger when you are here . &quot;
She slept on a <unk> in the room , waking often to <unk> the fire , to feed , lift , or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything , and &quot; tried not to be a trouble . &quot;
All day she haunted the room , jealous of any other nurse , and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her .
<unk> and helpful hours to Jo , for now her heart received the teaching that it needed ; lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them ; charity for all , the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget <unk> , the loyalty to duty that makes the <unk> easy , and the sincere faith that fears nothing , but <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , when she woke , Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book , heard her singing softly , to <unk> the <unk> night , or saw her <unk> her face upon her hands , while slow tears dropped through the <unk> fingers ; and Jo would lie watching her , with thoughts too deep for tears , feeling that Beth , in her simple , unselfish way , was trying to <unk> herself from the dear old life , and fit herself for the life to come , by sacred words of comfort , quiet prayers , and the music she loved so well .
Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons , the <unk> <unk> , the most <unk> prayers that any voice could utter ; for , with eyes made clear by many tears , and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow , she <unk> the beauty of her sister &apos;s life , <unk> , <unk> , yet full of the genuine virtues which &quot; smell sweet , and blossom in the dust , &quot; the <unk> that makes the <unk> on earth remembered <unk> in heaven , the true success which is possible to all .
One night , when Beth looked among the books upon her table , to find something to make her forget the mortal <unk> that was almost as hard to bear as pain , as she turned the leaves of her old favorite Pilgrim &apos;s Progress , she found a little paper , scribbled over in Jo &apos;s hand .
The name caught her eye , and the <unk> look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it .
&quot; Poor Jo !
she &apos;s fast asleep , so I won &apos;t wake her to ask leave ; she shows me all her things , and I don &apos;t think she &apos;ll mind if I look at this , &quot; thought Beth , with a glance at her sister , who lay on the rug , with the tongs beside her , ready to wake up the minute the <unk> fell apart .
&quot; MY BETH .
&quot; Sitting patient in the shadow <unk> the blessed light shall come , A serene and saintly presence <unk> our troubled home .
<unk> joys and hopes and sorrows <unk> like <unk> on the <unk> Of the deep and solemn river Where her willing feet now stand .
&quot; O my sister , passing from me , Out of human care and <unk> , Leave me , as a gift , those virtues Which have beautified your life .
Dear , <unk> me that great patience Which has power to sustain A cheerful , <unk> spirit In its <unk> of pain .
&quot; Give me , for I need it sorely , Of that courage , wise and sweet , Which has made the path of duty <unk> <unk> your willing feet .
Give me that unselfish nature , That with charity divine Can pardon wrong for love &apos;s dear <unk> <unk> heart , forgive me mine !
&quot; <unk> our parting daily <unk> Something of its bitter pain , And while learning this hard lesson , My great loss becomes my gain .
For the touch of grief will render My wild nature more serene , Give to life new <unk> , A new trust in the unseen .
&quot; <unk> , safe across the river , I shall see <unk> A beloved , household spirit <unk> for me on the shore .
Hope and faith , born of my sorrow , <unk> angels shall become , And the sister gone before me By their hands shall lead me home . &quot;
<unk> and blotted , <unk> and feeble , as the lines were , they brought a look of <unk> comfort to Beth &apos;s face , for her one regret had been that she had done so little ; and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been <unk> , that her death would not bring the despair she feared .
As she sat with the paper folded between her hands , the <unk> <unk> fell <unk> .
Jo started up , revived the blaze , and crept to the bedside , hoping Beth slept .
&quot; Not asleep , but so happy , dear .
See , I found this and read it ; I knew you wouldn &apos;t care .
Have I been all that to you , Jo ? &quot;
she asked , with wistful , humble earnestness .
&quot; O Beth , so much , so much ! &quot;
and Jo &apos;s head went down upon the pillow , beside her sister &apos;s .
&quot; Then I don &apos;t feel as if I &apos;d wasted my life .
I &apos;m not so good as you make me , but I _ have _ tried to do right ; and now , when it &apos;s too late to begin even to do better , it &apos;s such a comfort to know that some one loves me so much , and feels as if I &apos;d helped them . &quot;
&quot; More than any one in the world , Beth .
I used to think I couldn &apos;t let you go ; but I &apos;m learning to feel that I don &apos;t lose you ; that you &apos;ll be more to me than ever , and death can &apos;t part us , though it seems to . &quot;
&quot; I know it cannot , and I don &apos;t fear it any longer , for I &apos;m sure I shall be your Beth still , to love and help you more than ever .
You must take my place , Jo , and be everything to father and mother when I &apos;m gone .
They will turn to you , don &apos;t fail them ; and if it &apos;s hard to work alone , remember that I don &apos;t forget you , and that you &apos;ll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world ; for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go , and it makes the end so easy . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll try , Beth ; &quot; and then and there Jo <unk> her old ambition , <unk> herself to a new and better one , <unk> the poverty of other desires , and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the <unk> of love .
So the spring days came and went , the sky grew clearer , the earth <unk> , the flowers were up fair and early , and the birds came back in time to say good-by to Beth , who , like a tired but <unk> child , clung to the hands that had led her all her life , as father and mother <unk> her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow , and gave her up to God .
<unk> , except in books , do the dying utter <unk> words , see visions , or <unk> with <unk> <unk> ; and those who have <unk> many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply as sleep .
As Beth had hoped , the &quot; tide went out easily ; &quot; and in the dark hour before the dawn , on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath , she quietly drew her last , with no farewell but one loving look , one little sigh .
With tears and prayers and tender hands , mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never <unk> again , seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful <unk> that soon replaced the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long , and feeling , with <unk> joy , that to their darling death was a benignant angel , not a <unk> full of dread .
When morning came , for the first time in many months the fire was out , Jo &apos;s place was empty , and the room was very still .
But a bird sang blithely on a budding <unk> , close by , the <unk> blossomed freshly at the window , and the spring sunshine <unk> in like a <unk> over the placid face upon the pillow , --a face so full of <unk> peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears , and thanked God that Beth was well at last .

<unk> TO <unk> .
Amy &apos;s lecture did Laurie good , though , of course , he did not own it till long afterward ; men seldom do , for when women are the <unk> , the lords of creation don &apos;t take the advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do ; then they act upon it , and , if it <unk> , they give the <unk> <unk> half the credit of it ; if it fails , they generously give her the whole .
Laurie went back to his grandfather , and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the <unk> of Nice had improved him wonderfully , and he had better try it again .
There was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better , but <unk> could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received ; pride <unk> , and whenever the longing grew very strong , he <unk> his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest impression , &quot; I <unk> you ; &quot; &quot; Go and do something splendid that will _ make _ her love you . &quot;
Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he _ had _ been selfish and lazy ; but then when a man has a great sorrow , he should be indulged in all sorts of <unk> till he has lived it down .
He felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now ; and , though he should never <unk> to be a faithful <unk> , there was no occasion to wear his <unk> <unk> .
Jo _ wouldn &apos;t _ love him , but he might _ make _ her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a girl &apos;s &quot; No &quot; had not spoilt his life .
He had always meant to do something , and Amy &apos;s advice was quite unnecessary .
He had only been waiting till the <unk> blighted affections were <unk> <unk> ; that being done , he felt that he was ready to &quot; hide his stricken heart , and still <unk> on . &quot;
As <unk> , when he had a joy or a grief , put it into a song , so Laurie resolved to <unk> his <unk> in music , and compose a <unk> which should <unk> up Jo &apos;s soul and melt the heart of every <unk> .
<unk> the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody , and ordered him off , he went to <unk> , where he had musical friends , and fell to work with the firm <unk> to <unk> himself .
But , whether the sorrow was too <unk> to be <unk> in music , or music too <unk> to <unk> a mortal woe , he soon discovered that the <unk> was beyond him , just at present .
It was evident that his mind was not in working order yet , and his ideas needed <unk> ; for often in the middle of a plaintive strain , he would find himself humming a dancing tune that <unk> recalled the Christmas ball at Nice , especially the stout Frenchman , and put an <unk> stop to tragic <unk> for the time being .
Then he tried an <unk> , for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning ; but here , again , <unk> <unk> <unk> him .
He wanted Jo for his heroine , and called upon his memory to supply him with tender <unk> and romantic visions of his love .
But memory turned <unk> ; and , as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl , would only <unk> Jo &apos;s <unk> , faults , and <unk> , would only show her in the most <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with her head tied up in a <unk> , <unk> herself with the <unk> , or throwing cold water over his passion _ ?
la _ <unk> , --and an irresistible laugh spoilt the pensive picture he was <unk> to paint .
Jo wouldn &apos;t be put into the <unk> at any price , and he had to give her up with a &quot; Bless that girl , what a torment she is ! &quot;
and a <unk> at his hair , as became a distracted <unk> .
When he looked about him for another and a less <unk> <unk> to <unk> in melody , memory produced one with the most obliging <unk> .
This <unk> wore many faces , but it always had golden hair , was enveloped in a <unk> cloud , and floated <unk> before his mind &apos;s eye in a pleasing <unk> of roses , peacocks , white ponies , and blue ribbons .
He did not give the <unk> <unk> any name , but he took her for his heroine , and grew quite fond of her , as well he might ; for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun , and escorted her , <unk> , through trials which would have <unk> any mortal woman .
Thanks to this inspiration , he got on <unk> for a time , but gradually the work lost its charm , and he forgot to compose , while he sat <unk> , pen in hand , or roamed about the gay city to get new ideas and refresh his mind , which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter .
He did not do much , but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself .
&quot; It &apos;s genius simmering , perhaps .
I &apos;ll let it <unk> , and see what comes of it , &quot; he said , with a secret suspicion , all the while , that it wasn &apos;t genius , but something far more common .
Whatever it was , it <unk> to some purpose , for he grew more and more discontented with his <unk> life , began to long for some real and earnest work to go at , soul and body , and finally came to the wise conclusion that every one who loved music was not a <unk> .
<unk> from one of <unk> &apos;s grand <unk> , splendidly performed at the <unk> <unk> , he looked over his own , played a few of the best parts , sat staring up at the busts of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , who stared benignly back again ; then suddenly he tore up his <unk> , one by one , and , as the last <unk> out of his hand , he said soberly to himself , -- &quot; She is right !
<unk> isn &apos;t genius , and you can &apos;t make it so .
That music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her , and I won &apos;t be a <unk> any longer .
Now what shall I do ? &quot;
That seemed a hard question to answer , and Laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread .
Now , if ever , occurred an <unk> opportunity for &quot; going to the <unk> , &quot; as he once <unk> expressed it , for he had plenty of money and nothing to do , and <unk> is <unk> fond of providing <unk> for full and idle hands .
The poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within , but he <unk> them pretty well ; for , much as he valued liberty , he valued good faith and confidence more , so his promise to his grandfather , and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him , and say &quot; All &apos;s well , &quot; kept him safe and steady .
Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe , &quot; I don &apos;t believe it ; boys will be boys , young men must <unk> their wild <unk> , and women must not expect <unk> . &quot;
I dare say _ you _ don &apos;t , Mrs. Grundy , but it &apos;s true nevertheless .
Women work a good many <unk> , and I have a <unk> that they may perform even that of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> by <unk> to <unk> such <unk> .
Let the boys be boys , the longer the better , and let the young men <unk> their wild <unk> if they must ; but mothers , sisters , and friends may help to make the crop a small one , and keep many <unk> from spoiling the <unk> , by believing , and showing that they believe , in the <unk> of loyalty to the virtues which make men <unk> in good women &apos;s eyes .
If it _ is _ a feminine delusion , leave us to enjoy it while we may , for without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost , and sorrowful <unk> would <unk> all our hopes of the brave , tender-hearted little lads , who still love their mothers better than themselves , and are not ashamed to own it .
Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would <unk> all his powers for years ; but , to his great surprise , he discovered it grew easier every day .
He refused to believe it at first , got angry with himself , and couldn &apos;t understand it ; but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things , and time and nature work their will in spite of us .
Laurie &apos;s heart _ wouldn &apos;t _ ache ; the wound persisted in <unk> with a rapidity that astonished him , and , instead of trying to forget , he found himself trying to remember .
He had not <unk> this turn of affairs , and was not prepared for it .
He was disgusted with himself , surprised at his own <unk> , and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon .
He carefully stirred up the <unk> of his lost love , but they refused to burst into a blaze : there was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever , and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly <unk> into a more tranquil sentiment , very tender , a little sad and resentful still , but that was sure to pass away in time , leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end .
As the word &quot; brotherly &quot; passed through his mind in one of these <unk> , he smiled , and glanced up at the picture of <unk> that was before him : -- &quot; Well , he was a great man ; and when he couldn &apos;t have one sister he took the other , and was happy . &quot;
Laurie did not utter the words , but he thought them ; and the next instant kissed the little old ring , saying to himself , -- &quot; No , I won &apos;t !
I haven &apos;t forgotten , I never can .
I &apos;ll try again , and if that fails , why , <unk> &quot; Leaving his sentence unfinished , he seized pen and paper and wrote to Jo , telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind .
Couldn &apos;t she , wouldn &apos;t she , and let him come home and be happy ?
While waiting for an answer he did nothing , but he did it energetically , for he was in a fever of impatience .
It came at last , and settled his mind effectually on one point , for Jo decidedly couldn &apos;t and wouldn &apos;t .
She was wrapped up in Beth , and never wished to hear the word &quot; love &quot; again .
Then she begged him to be happy with somebody else , but always to keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister Jo .
In a <unk> she desired him not to tell Amy that Beth was worse ; she was coming home in the spring , and there was no need of <unk> the <unk> of her stay .
That would be time enough , please God , but Laurie must write to her often , and not let her feel lonely , homesick , or anxious .
&quot; So I will , at once .
Poor little girl ; it will be a sad going home for her , I &apos;m afraid ; &quot; and Laurie opened his desk , as if writing to Amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before .
But he did not write the letter that day ; for , as he <unk> out his best paper , he came across something which changed his purpose .
<unk> about in one part of the desk , among bills , <unk> , and business <unk> of various kinds , were several of Jo &apos;s letters , and in another <unk> were three notes from Amy , carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons , and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside .
With a <unk> , <unk> expression , Laurie gathered up all Jo &apos;s letters , smoothed , folded , and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk , stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger , then slowly drew it off , laid it with the letters , locked the drawer , and went out to hear <unk> <unk> at Saint <unk> &apos;s , feeling as if there had been a funeral ; and , though not <unk> with affliction , this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies .
&#91; Illustration : Turning the ring thoughtfully upon his finger &#93; The letter went very soon , however , and was promptly answered , for Amy _ was _ homesick , and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner .
The <unk> flourished <unk> , and letters flew to and fro , with <unk> regularity , all through the early spring .
Laurie sold his busts , made <unk> of his opera , and went back to Paris , hoping somebody would arrive before long .
He wanted desperately to go to Nice , but would not till he was asked ; and Amy would not ask him , for just then she was having little experiences of her own , which made her rather wish to avoid the <unk> eyes of &quot; our boy . &quot;
Fred Vaughn had returned , and put the question to which she had once decided to answer &quot; Yes , thank you ; &quot; but now she said , &quot; No , thank you , &quot; kindly but steadily ; for , when the time came , her courage failed her , and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears .
The words , &quot; Fred is a good fellow , but not at all the man I fancied you would ever like , &quot; and Laurie &apos;s face when he uttered them , kept returning to her as <unk> as her own did when she said in look , if not in words , &quot; I shall marry for money . &quot;
It troubled her to remember that now , she wished she could take it back , it sounded so <unk> .
She didn &apos;t want Laurie to think her a <unk> , worldly creature ; she didn &apos;t care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a <unk> woman ; she was so glad he didn &apos;t hate her for the dreadful things she said , but took them so beautifully , and was kinder than ever .
His letters were such a comfort , for the home letters were very <unk> , and were not half so satisfactory as his when they did come .
It was not only a pleasure , but a duty to answer them , for the poor fellow was forlorn , and needed petting , since Jo persisted in being <unk> .
She ought to have made an effort , and tried to love him ; it couldn &apos;t be very hard , many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them ; but Jo never would act like other girls , so there was nothing to do but be very kind , and treat him like a brother .
If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period , they would be a much happier race of beings than they are .
Amy never lectured now ; she asked his opinion on all <unk> ; she was interested in everything he did , made charming little presents for him , and sent him two letters a week , full of lively gossip , sisterly confidences , and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her .
As few brothers are <unk> by having their letters carried about in their sisters &apos; pockets , read and <unk> diligently , cried over when short , kissed when long , and <unk> carefully , we will not hint that Amy did any of these fond and foolish things .
But she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring , lost much of her relish for society , and went out sketching alone a good deal .
She never had much to show when she came home , but was studying nature , I dare say , while she sat for hours , with her hands folded , on the terrace at Valrosa , or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her , --a <unk> knight <unk> on a tomb , a young man asleep in the grass , with his hat over his eyes , or a <unk> girl in gorgeous array , <unk> down a <unk> on the arm of a tall gentleman , both faces being left a <unk> according to the last fashion in art , which was safe , but not altogether satisfactory .
Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred ; and , finding <unk> <unk> and <unk> impossible , Amy left her to think what she liked , taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to <unk> .
That was all , but he understood it , and looked relieved , as he said to himself , with a venerable air , -- &quot; I was sure she would think better of it .
Poor old fellow !
I &apos;ve been through it all , and I can sympathize . &quot;
With that he <unk> a great sigh , and then , as if he had <unk> his duty to the past , put his feet up on the sofa , and enjoyed Amy &apos;s letter luxuriously .
While these changes were going on abroad , trouble had come at home ; but the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy , and when the next found her , the grass was green above her sister .
The sad news met her at Vevay , for the <unk> had driven them from Nice in May , and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland , by way of <unk> and the Italian <unk> .
She bore it very well , and quietly <unk> to the family <unk> that she should not <unk> her visit , for , since it was too late to say good-by to Beth , she had better stay , and let absence <unk> her sorrow .
But her heart was very heavy ; she longed to be at home , and every day looked wistfully across the lake , waiting for Laurie to come and comfort her .
He did come very soon ; for the same mail brought letters to them both , but he was in Germany , and it took some days to reach him .
The moment he read it , he packed his <unk> , bade <unk> to his <unk> , and was off to keep his promise , with a heart full of joy and sorrow , hope and suspense .
He knew Vevay well ; and as soon as the boat touched the little <unk> , he hurried along the shore to <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> were living _ en <unk> _ .
The _ <unk> ? on _ was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake ; but no , the <unk> mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden .
If <unk> would give himself the pain of sitting down , a flash of time should present her .
But <unk> could not wait even &quot; a flash of time , &quot; and , in the middle of the speech , departed to find mademoiselle himself .
A pleasant old garden on the <unk> of the lovely lake , with <unk> rustling overhead , ivy <unk> everywhere , and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water .
At one corner of the wide , low wall was a seat , and here Amy often came to read or work , or console herself with the beauty all about her .
She was sitting here that day , leaning her head on her hand , with a homesick heart and heavy eyes , thinking of Beth , and wondering why Laurie did not come .
She did not hear him cross the <unk> beyond , nor see him pause in the <unk> that led from the <unk> path into the garden .
He stood a minute , looking at her with new eyes , seeing what no one had ever seen before , --the tender side of Amy &apos;s character .
Everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow , --the blotted letters in her lap , the black ribbon that tied up her hair , the womanly pain and patience in her face ; even the little <unk> cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie , for he had given it to her , and she wore it as her only ornament .
If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him , they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him ; for , dropping everything , she ran to him , exclaiming , in a tone of <unk> love and longing , -- &quot; O Laurie , Laurie , I knew you &apos;d come to me ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : O Laurie , Laurie , I knew you &apos;d come &#93; I think everything was said and settled then ; for , as they stood together quite silent for a moment , with the dark head bent down <unk> over the light one , Amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as Laurie , and Laurie decided that Amy was the only woman in the world who could fill Jo &apos;s place , and make him happy .
He did not tell her so ; but she was not disappointed , for both felt the truth , were satisfied , and gladly left the rest to silence .
In a minute Amy went back to her place ; and , while she dried her tears , Laurie gathered up the scattered papers , finding in the sight of sundry well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future .
As he sat down beside her , Amy felt shy again , and turned rosy red at the recollection of her <unk> greeting .
&quot; I couldn &apos;t help it ; I felt so lonely and sad , and was so very glad to see you .
It was such a surprise to look up and find you , just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn &apos;t come , &quot; she said , trying in vain to speak quite naturally .
&quot; I came the minute I heard .
I wish I could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little Beth ; but I can only feel , and-- &quot; He could not get any further , for he , too , turned bashful all of a sudden , and did not quite know what to say .
He longed to lay Amy &apos;s head down on his shoulder , and tell her to have a good cry , but he did not dare ; so took her hand instead , and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words .
&quot; You needn &apos;t say anything ; this comforts me , &quot; she said softly .
&quot; Beth is well and happy , and I mustn &apos;t wish her back ; but I dread the going home , much as I long to see them all .
We won &apos;t talk about it now , for it makes me cry , and I want to enjoy you while you stay .
You needn &apos;t go right back , need you ? &quot;
&quot; Not if you want me , dear . &quot;
&quot; I do , so much .
Aunt and Flo are very kind ; but you seem like one of the family , and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while . &quot;
Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child , whose heart was full , that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once , and gave her just what she wanted , --the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed .
&quot; Poor little soul , you look as if you &apos;d grieved yourself <unk> !
I &apos;m going to take care of you , so don &apos;t cry any more , but come and walk about with me ; the wind is too chilly for you to sit still , &quot; he said , in the <unk> , <unk> way that Amy liked , as he tied on her hat , drew her arm through his , and began to pace up and down the sunny walk , under the <unk> <unk> .
He felt more at ease upon his legs ; and Amy found it very pleasant to have a strong arm to <unk> upon , a familiar face to smile at her , and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone .
The quaint old garden had <unk> many pairs of lovers , and seemed <unk> made for them , so sunny and <unk> was it , with nothing but the tower to <unk> them , and the wide lake to carry away the <unk> of their words , as it <unk> by below .
For an hour this new pair walked and talked , or rested on the wall , enjoying the sweet <unk> which gave such a charm to time and place ; and when an unromantic <unk> <unk> them away , Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden .
The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl &apos;s altered face , she was illuminated with a new idea , and exclaimed to herself , &quot; Now I understand it all , --the child has been pining for young Laurence .
Bless my heart , I never thought of such a thing ! &quot;
With praiseworthy discretion , the good lady said nothing , and betrayed no sign of <unk> ; but cordially <unk> Laurie to stay , and begged Amy to enjoy his society , for it would do her more good than so much solitude .
Amy was a model of <unk> ; and , as her aunt was a good deal <unk> with Flo , she was left to entertain her friend , and did it with more than her usual success .
At Nice , Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded ; at Vevay , Laurie was never idle , but always walking , riding , boating , or studying , in the most energetic manner , while Amy admired everything he did , and followed his example as far and as fast as she could .
He said the change was <unk> to the <unk> , and she did not <unk> him , being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits .
The <unk> air did them both good , and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as <unk> .
They seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills ; the fresh winds blew away <unk> doubts , <unk> fancies , and moody <unk> ; the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of <unk> ideas , tender hopes , and happy thoughts ; the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past , and the grand old <unk> to look benignly down upon them , saying , &quot; Little children , love one another . &quot;
In spite of the new sorrow , it was a very happy time , so happy that Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word .
It took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the <unk> cure of his first , and , as he had firmly believed , his last and only love .
He consoled himself for the seeming <unk> by the thought that Jo &apos;s sister was almost the same as Jo &apos;s self , and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well .
His first wooing had been of the <unk> order , and he looked back upon it as if through a long <unk> of years , with a feeling of <unk> <unk> with regret .
He was not ashamed of it , but put it away as one of the <unk> experiences of his life , for which he could be grateful when the pain was over .
His second wooing he resolved should be as calm and simple as possible ; there was no need of having a scene , hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her ; she knew it without words , and had given him his answer long ago .
It all came about so naturally that no one could complain , and he knew that everybody would be pleased , even Jo .
But when our first little passion has been crushed , we are apt to be <unk> and slow in making a second trial ; so Laurie let the days pass , enjoying every hour , and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance .
He had rather imagined that the _ d ? <unk> _ would take place in the chateau garden by moonlight , and in the most graceful and decorous manner ; but it turned out exactly the <unk> , for the matter was settled on the lake , at <unk> , in a few blunt words .
They had been floating about all the morning , from gloomy St. <unk> to sunny <unk> , with the <unk> of <unk> on one side , <unk> St. <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the other , pretty Vevay in the valley , and <unk> upon the hill beyond , a <unk> blue sky overhead , and the <unk> lake below , <unk> with the picturesque boats that look like <unk> <unk> .
They had been talking of <unk> , as they glided past <unk> , and of <unk> , as they looked up at <unk> , where he wrote his &quot; <unk> ? <unk> . &quot;
Neither had read it , but they knew it was a <unk> , and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own .
Amy had been <unk> her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them , and , when she looked up , Laurie was leaning on his oars , with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily , merely for the sake of saying something , -- &quot; You must be tired ; rest a little , and let me row ; it will do me good ; for , since you came , I have been altogether lazy and luxurious . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not tired ; but you may take an oar , if you like .
There &apos;s room enough , though I have to sit nearly in the middle , else the boat won &apos;t <unk> , &quot; returned Laurie , as if he rather liked the arrangement .
Feeling that she had not mended matters much , Amy took the offered third of a seat , shook her hair over her face , and accepted an oar .
She rowed as well as she did many other things ; and , though she used both hands , and Laurie but one , the oars kept time , and the boat went smoothly through the water .
&#91; Illustration : How well we pull together &#93; &quot; How well we pull together , don &apos;t we ? &quot;
said Amy , who objected to silence just then .
&quot; So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat .
Will you , Amy ? &quot;
very tenderly .
&quot; Yes , Laurie , &quot; very low .
Then they both stopped <unk> , and unconsciously added a pretty little _ <unk> _ of human love and happiness to the <unk> views reflected in the lake .
<unk> .
ALL <unk> .
It was easy to promise <unk> when self was wrapped up in another , and heart and soul were <unk> by a sweet example ; but when the helpful voice was silent , the daily lesson over , the beloved presence gone , and nothing remained but loneliness and grief , then Jo found her promise very hard to keep .
How could she &quot; comfort father and mother , &quot; when her own heart ached with a <unk> longing for her sister ; how could she &quot; make the house cheerful , &quot; when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home for the new ; and where in all the world could she &quot; find some useful , happy work to do , &quot; that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward ?
She tried in a blind , <unk> way to do her duty , secretly <unk> against it all the while , for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened , her burdens made <unk> , and life get harder and harder as she <unk> along .
Some people seemed to get all sunshine , and some all shadow ; it was not fair , for she tried more than Amy to be good , but never got any reward , only disappointment , trouble , and hard work .
Poor Jo , these were dark days to her , for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house , devoted to <unk> cares , a few small pleasures , and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier .
&quot; I can &apos;t do it .
I wasn &apos;t meant for a life like this , and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if somebody don &apos;t come and help me , &quot; she said to herself , when her first efforts failed , and she fell into the moody , miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to <unk> to the <unk> .
But some one did come and help her , though Jo did not <unk> her good angels at once , because they wore familiar <unk> , and used the simple <unk> best fitted to poor <unk> .
<unk> she started up at night , thinking Beth called her ; and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of an <unk> sorrow , &quot; O Beth , come back !
come back ! &quot;
she did not stretch out her <unk> arms in vain ; for , as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sister &apos;s <unk> whisper , her mother came to comfort her , not with words only , but the patient tenderness that <unk> by a touch , tears that were mute <unk> of a greater grief than Jo &apos;s , and broken whispers , more eloquent than prayers , because hopeful resignation went <unk> with natural sorrow .
<unk> moments , when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night , turning affliction to a blessing , which <unk> grief and strengthened love .
Feeling this , Jo &apos;s burden seemed easier to bear , duty grew sweeter , and life looked more <unk> , seen from the safe shelter of her mother &apos;s arms .
When aching heart was a little comforted , troubled mind likewise found help ; for one day she went to the study , and , leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile , she said , very humbly , -- &quot; Father , talk to me as you did to Beth .
I need it more than she did , for I &apos;m all wrong . &quot;
&quot; My dear , nothing can comfort me like this , &quot; he answered , with a <unk> in his voice , and both arms round her , as if he , too , needed help , and did not fear to ask it .
&#91; Illustration : Jo and her father &#93; Then , sitting in Beth &apos;s little chair close beside him , Jo told her troubles , --the resentful sorrow for her loss , the <unk> efforts that <unk> her , the want of faith that made life look so dark , and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair .
She gave him entire confidence , he gave her the help she needed , and both found consolation in the act ; for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter , but as man and woman , able and glad to serve each other with <unk> sympathy as well as <unk> love .
Happy , thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called &quot; the <unk> of one member , &quot; and from which she came with fresh courage , recovered cheerfulness , and a more submissive spirit ; for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear , were trying now to teach another to accept life without <unk> or <unk> , and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power .
Other helps had Jo , <unk> , wholesome duties and delights that would not be <unk> their part in <unk> her , and which she slowly learned to see and value .
<unk> and <unk> never could be as <unk> as they once had been , for Beth had presided over both ; and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to <unk> round the little mop and the old <unk> , that was never thrown away .
As she used them , Jo found herself humming the songs Beth used to hum , imitating Beth &apos;s <unk> ways , and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cosey , which was the first step toward making home happy , though she didn &apos;t know it , till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand , -- &quot; You thoughtful <unk> , you &apos;re determined we sha &apos;n&apos;t miss that dear <unk> ef you can help it .
We don &apos;t say much , but we see it , and the Lord will bless you for &apos;t , see ef He don &apos;t . &quot;
As they sat sewing together , Jo discovered how much improved her sister Meg was ; how well she could talk , how much she knew about good , womanly <unk> , thoughts , and feelings , how happy she was in husband and children , and how much they were all doing for each other .
&quot; <unk> is an excellent thing , after all .
I wonder if I should blossom out half as well as you have , if I tried it ? &quot;
said Jo , as she <unk> a <unk> for Demi , in the topsy-turvy nursery .
&quot; It &apos;s just what you need to bring out the tender , womanly half of your nature , Jo .
You are like a <unk> , prickly outside , but <unk> within , and a sweet <unk> , if one can only get at it .
Love will make you show your heart some day , and then the rough burr will fall off . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , ma &apos;am , and it takes a good shake to bring them down .
Boys go <unk> , and I don &apos;t care to be <unk> by them , &quot; returned Jo , <unk> away at the <unk> which no wind that blows would ever carry up , for Daisy had tied herself on as a <unk> .
Meg laughed , for she was glad to see a <unk> of Jo &apos;s old spirit , but she felt it her duty to <unk> her opinion by every argument in her power ; and the sisterly <unk> were not wasted , especially as two of Meg &apos;s most effective <unk> were the babies , whom Jo loved tenderly .
<unk> is the best <unk> for some hearts , and Jo &apos;s was nearly ready for the bag : a little more sunshine to ripen the <unk> , then , not a boy &apos;s impatient shake , but a man &apos;s hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr , and find the <unk> sound and sweet .
If she had suspected this , she would have shut up tight , and been more prickly than ever ; <unk> she wasn &apos;t thinking about herself , so , when the time came , down she dropped .
Now , if she had been the heroine of a moral story-book , she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly , <unk> the world , and gone about doing good in a <unk> bonnet , with <unk> in her pocket .
But , you see , Jo wasn &apos;t a heroine ; she was only a struggling human girl , like hundreds of others , and she just acted out her nature , being sad , cross , listless , or energetic , as the mood suggested .
It &apos;s highly virtuous to say we &apos;ll be good , but we can &apos;t do it all at once , and it takes a long pull , a strong pull , and a pull all together , before some of us even get our feet set in the right way .
Jo had got so far , she was learning to do her duty , and to feel unhappy if she did not ; but to do it <unk> , that was another thing !
She had often said she wanted to do something splendid , no matter how hard ; and now she had her wish , for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to father and mother , trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her ?
And , if <unk> were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort , what could be harder for a restless , ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes , plans , and desires , and cheerfully live for others ?
<unk> had taken her at her word ; here was the task , not what she had expected , but better , because self had no part in it : now , could she do it ?
She decided that she would try ; and , in her first attempt , she found the helps I have suggested .
<unk> another was given her , and she took it , not as a reward , but as a comfort , as Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little <unk> where he rested , as he climbed the hill called <unk> .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you write ?
That always used to make you happy , &quot; said her mother , once , when the <unk> fit <unk> Jo .
&quot; I &apos;ve no heart to write , and if I had , nobody cares for my things . &quot;
&quot; We do ; write something for us , and never mind the rest of the world .
Try it , dear ; I &apos;m sure it would do you good , and please us very much . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t believe I can ; &quot; but Jo got out her desk , and began to <unk> her half-finished manuscripts .
An hour afterward her mother peeped in , and there she was , scratching away , with her black pinafore on , and an absorbed expression , which caused Mrs. March to smile , and slip away , well pleased with the success of her <unk> .
Jo never knew how it happened , but something got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it ; for , when her family had laughed and cried over it , her father sent it , much against her will , to one of the popular <unk> , and , to her utter surprise , it was not only paid for , but others requested .
Letters from several persons , whose praise was honor , followed the appearance of the little story , newspapers copied it , and strangers as well as friends admired it .
For a small thing it was a great success ; and Jo was more astonished than when her novel was <unk> and <unk> all at once .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand it .
What _ can _ there be in a simple little story like that , to make people praise it so ? &quot;
she said , quite bewildered .
&quot; There is truth in it , Jo , that &apos;s the secret ; humor and <unk> make it alive , and you have found your style at last .
You wrote with no thought of fame or money , and put your heart into it , my daughter ; you have had the bitter , now comes the sweet .
Do your best , and grow as happy as we are in your success . &quot;
&quot; If there _ is _ anything good or true in what I write , it isn &apos;t mine ; I owe it all to you and mother and to Beth , &quot; said Jo , more touched by her father &apos;s words than by any amount of praise from the world .
So , taught by love and sorrow , Jo wrote her little stories , and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her , finding it a very <unk> world to such humble <unk> ; for they were kindly welcomed , and sent home comfortable <unk> to their mother , like dutiful children whom good fortune <unk> .
When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement , Mrs. March feared that Jo would find it difficult to <unk> over it , but her fears were soon set at rest ; for , though Jo looked grave at first , she took it very quietly , and was full of hopes and plans for &quot; the children &quot; before she read the letter twice .
It was a sort of written <unk> , <unk> each glorified the other in <unk> fashion , very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of , for no one had any objection to make .
&quot; You like it , mother ? &quot;
said Jo , as they laid down the closely written sheets , and looked at one another .
&quot; Yes , I hoped it would be so , ever since Amy wrote that she had refused Fred .
I felt sure then that something better than what you call the &apos; mercenary spirit &apos; had come over her , and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day . &quot;
&quot; How sharp you are , Marmee , and how silent !
You never said a word to me . &quot;
&quot; <unk> have need of sharp eyes and <unk> tongues when they have girls to manage .
I was half afraid to put the idea into your head , lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not the <unk> I was ; you may trust me , I &apos;m sober and sensible enough for any one &apos;s _ <unk> _ now . &quot;
&quot; So you are , dear , and I should have made you mine , only I fancied it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved any one else . &quot;
&quot; Now , mother , did you really think I could be so silly and selfish , after I &apos;d refused his love , when it was <unk> , if not best ? &quot;
&quot; I knew you were sincere then , Jo , but lately I have thought that if he came back , and asked again , you might , perhaps , feel like giving another answer .
Forgive me , dear , I can &apos;t help seeing that you are very lonely , and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart ; so I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now . &quot;
&quot; No , mother , it is better as it is , and I &apos;m glad Amy has learned to love him .
But you are right in one thing : I _ am _ lonely , and perhaps if Teddy had tried again , I might have said &apos; Yes , &apos; not because I love him any more , but because I care more to be loved than when he went away . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad of that , Jo , for it shows that you are getting on .
There are plenty to love you , so try to be satisfied with father and mother , sisters and brothers , friends and babies , till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward . &quot;
&quot; <unk> are the _ best _ lovers in the world ; but I don &apos;t mind whispering to Marmee that I &apos;d like to try all kinds .
It &apos;s very curious , but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections , the more I seem to want .
I &apos;d no idea hearts could take in so many ; mine is so <unk> , it never seems full now , and I used to be quite contented with my family .
I don &apos;t understand it . &quot;
&quot; I do ; &quot; and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile , as Jo turned back the leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie .
&quot; It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me ; he isn &apos;t sentimental , doesn &apos;t say much about it , but I see and feel it in all he says and does , and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don &apos;t seem to be the same girl I was .
I never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now , for he lets me read his heart , and I find it full of noble <unk> and hopes and <unk> , and am so proud to know it &apos;s mine .
He says he feels as if he &apos; could make a <unk> voyage now with me <unk> as mate , and lots of love for <unk> . &apos;
I pray he may , and try to be all he <unk> me , for I love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might , and never will desert him , while God lets us be together .
O mother , I never knew how much like heaven this world could be , when two people love and live for one another ! &quot;
&quot; And that &apos;s our cool , <unk> , and worldly Amy !
Truly , love does work <unk> .
How very , very happy they must be ! &quot;
And Jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand , as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance , which holds the reader fast till the end comes , and he finds himself alone in the <unk> world again .
By and by Jo roamed away upstairs , for it was rainy , and she could not walk .
A restless spirit possessed her , and the old feeling came again , not bitter as it once was , but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked , the other nothing .
It was not true ; she knew that , and tried to put it away , but the natural <unk> for affection was strong , and Amy &apos;s happiness woke the hungry longing for some one to &quot; love with heart and soul , and cling to while God let them be together . &quot;
Up in the garret , where Jo &apos;s <unk> wanderings ended , stood four little wooden chests in a row , each marked with its owner &apos;s name , and each filled with relics of the <unk> and <unk> ended now for all .
Jo glanced into them , and when she came to her own , leaned her chin on the <unk> , and stared absently at the chaotic collection , till a bundle of old <unk> caught her eye .
She drew them out , turned them over , and <unk> that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke &apos;s .
She had smiled at first , then she looked thoughtful , next sad , and when she came to a little message written in the Professor &apos;s hand , her lips began to <unk> , the books <unk> out of her lap , and she sat looking at the friendly words , as if they took a new meaning , and touched a tender spot in her heart .
&quot; Wait for me , my friend .
I may be a little late , but I shall surely come . &quot;
&quot; Oh , if he only would !
So kind , so good , so patient with me always ; my dear old Fritz , I didn &apos;t value him half enough when I had him , but now how I should love to see him , for every one seems going away from me , and I &apos;m all alone . &quot;
And holding the little paper fast , as if it were a promise yet to be <unk> , Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag-bag , and cried , as if in opposition to the rain <unk> on the roof .
&#91; Illustration : Jo laid her head on a comfortable rag-bag and cried &#93; Was it all <unk> , loneliness , or low spirits ?
or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had <unk> its time as patiently as its <unk> ?
Who shall say ?
&#91; Illustration : A substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her &#93; <unk> .
<unk> .
Jo was alone in the twilight , lying on the old sofa , looking at the fire , and thinking .
It was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk ; no one disturbed her , and she used to lie there on Beth &apos;s little red pillow , planning stories , dreaming dreams , or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away .
Her face looked tired , grave , and rather sad ; for to-morrow was her birthday , and she was thinking how fast the years went by , how old she was getting , and how little she seemed to have accomplished .
<unk> twenty-five , and nothing to show for it .
Jo was mistaken in that ; there was a good deal to show , and by and by she saw , and was grateful for it .
&quot; An old maid , that &apos;s what I &apos;m to be .
A literary spinster , with a pen for a spouse , a family of stories for children , and twenty years <unk> a morsel of fame , perhaps ; when , like poor <unk> , I &apos;m old , and can &apos;t enjoy it , solitary , and can &apos;t share it , independent , and don &apos;t need it .
Well , I needn &apos;t be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner ; and , I dare say , old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it ; <unk> &quot; and there Jo sighed , as if the prospect was not inviting .
It seldom is , at first , and thirty seems the end of all things to five-and-twenty ; but it &apos;s not so bad as it looks , and one can get on quite happily if one has something in one &apos;s self to fall back upon .
At twenty-five , girls begin to talk about being old maids , but secretly resolve that they never will be ; at thirty they say nothing about it , but quietly accept the fact , and , if sensible , console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful , happy years , in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully .
Don &apos;t laugh at the <unk> , dear girls , for often very tender , tragical romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns , and many silent sacrifices of youth , health , ambition , love itself , make the faded faces beautiful in God &apos;s sight .
Even the sad , sour sisters should be kindly <unk> with , because they have missed the sweetest part of life , if for no other reason ; and , looking at them with <unk> , not <unk> , girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time ; that rosy cheeks don &apos;t last forever , that silver <unk> will come in the bonnie brown hair , and that , by and by , kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now .
<unk> , which means boys , be <unk> to the old maids , no matter how poor and plain and prim , for the only <unk> worth having is that which is the <unk> to pay <unk> to the old , <unk> the feeble , and serve <unk> , regardless of rank , age , or color .
Just <unk> the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed , but nursed and petted , too often without thanks ; the scrapes they have helped you out of , the &quot; <unk> &quot; they have given you from their small store , the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you , the steps the willing old feet have taken , and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live .
The bright-eyed girls are quick to see such <unk> , and will like you all the better for them ; and if death , almost the only power that can part mother and son , should <unk> you of yours , you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal <unk> from some Aunt <unk> , who has kept the <unk> corner of her lonely old heart for the &quot; the best nevvy in the world . &quot;
Jo must have fallen asleep ( as I dare say my reader has during this little <unk> ) , for suddenly Laurie &apos;s ghost seemed to stand before her , --a substantial , lifelike ghost , <unk> over her , with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn &apos;t like to show it .
But , like Jenny in the <unk> , -- &quot; She could not think it he , &quot; and lay staring up at him in startled silence , till he stooped and kissed her .
Then she knew him , and flew up , crying joyfully , -- &quot; O my Teddy !
O my Teddy ! &quot;
&quot; Dear Jo , you are glad to see me , then ? &quot;
&quot; Glad !
My blessed boy , words can &apos;t express my <unk> .
Where &apos;s Amy ? &quot;
&quot; Your mother has got her down at Meg &apos;s .
We stopped there by the way , and there was no getting my wife out of their <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Your what ? &quot;
cried Jo , for Laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him .
&quot; Oh , the dickens !
now I &apos;ve done it ; &quot; and he looked so guilty that Jo was down upon him like a flash .
&quot; You &apos;ve gone and got married ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , please , but I never will again ; &quot; and he went down upon his knees , with a penitent <unk> of hands , and a face full of mischief , <unk> , and triumph .
&quot; <unk> married ? &quot;
&quot; Very much so , thank you . &quot;
&quot; Mercy on us !
What dreadful thing will you do next ? &quot;
and Jo fell into her seat , with a <unk> .
&quot; A characteristic , but not exactly <unk> , <unk> , &quot; returned Laurie , still in an abject attitude , but beaming with satisfaction .
&quot; What can you expect , when you take one &apos;s breath away , <unk> in like a <unk> , and letting cats out of bags like that ?
Get up , you ridiculous boy , and tell me all about it . &quot;
&quot; Not a word , unless you let me come in my old place , and promise not to barricade . &quot;
Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day , and patted the sofa invitingly , as she said , in a cordial tone , -- &quot; The old pillow is up garret , and we don &apos;t need it now ; so , come and &apos; fess , Teddy . &quot;
&quot; How good it sounds to hear you say &apos; Teddy &apos; !
No one ever calls me that but you ; &quot; and Laurie sat down , with an air of great content .
&quot; What does Amy call you ? &quot;
&quot; My lord . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s like her .
Well , you look it ; &quot; and Jo &apos;s eyes plainly betrayed that she found her boy <unk> than ever .
The pillow was gone , but there _ was _ a barricade , nevertheless , --a natural one , <unk> by time , absence , and change of heart .
Both felt it , and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible <unk> cast a little shadow over them .
It was gone directly , however , for Laurie said , with a vain attempt at dignity , -- &quot; Don &apos;t I look like a married man and the head of a family ? &quot;
&quot; Not a bit , and you never will .
You &apos;ve grown bigger and <unk> , but you are the same <unk> as ever . &quot;
&quot; Now , really , Jo , you ought to treat me with more respect , &quot; began Laurie , who enjoyed it all immensely .
&quot; How can I , when the mere idea of you , married and settled , is so <unk> funny that I can &apos;t keep sober ! &quot;
answered Jo , smiling all over her face , so <unk> that they had another laugh , and then settled down for a good talk , quite in the pleasant old fashion .
&quot; It &apos;s no use your going out in the cold to get Amy , for they are all coming up presently .
I couldn &apos;t wait ; I wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise , and have &apos; first <unk> , &apos; as we used to say when we <unk> about the cream . &quot;
&quot; Of course you did , and spoilt your story by beginning at the wrong end .
Now , start right , and tell me how it all happened ; I &apos;m pining to know . &quot;
&quot; Well , I did it to please Amy , &quot; began Laurie , with a twinkle that made Jo exclaim , -- &quot; <unk> number one ; Amy did it to please you .
Go on , and tell the truth , if you can , sir . &quot;
&quot; Now she &apos;s beginning to <unk> it ; isn &apos;t it jolly to hear her ? &quot;
said Laurie to the fire , and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed .
&quot; It &apos;s all the same , you know , she and I being one .
We planned to come home with the <unk> , a month or more ago , but they suddenly changed their minds , and decided to pass another winter in Paris .
But grandpa wanted to come home ; he went to please me , and I couldn &apos;t let him go alone , neither could I leave Amy ; and Mrs. Carrol had got English notions about <unk> and such nonsense , and wouldn &apos;t let Amy come with us .
So I just settled the difficulty by saying , &apos; Let &apos;s be married , and then we can do as we like . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Of course you did ; you always have things to suit you . &quot;
&quot; Not always ; &quot; and something in Laurie &apos;s voice made Jo say hastily , -- &quot; How did you ever get aunt to agree ? &quot;
&quot; It was hard work ; but , between us , we talked her over , for we had heaps of good <unk> on our side .
There wasn &apos;t time to write and ask leave , but you all liked it , had consented to it by and by , and it was only &apos; taking Time by the fetlock , &apos; as my wife says . &quot;
&quot; Aren &apos;t we proud of those two words , and don &apos;t we like to say them ? &quot;
interrupted Jo , <unk> the fire in her turn , and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to <unk> in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last .
&quot; A trifle , perhaps ; she &apos;s such a captivating little woman I can &apos;t help being proud of her .
Well , then , uncle and aunt were there to play propriety ; we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart , and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all round ; so we did it . &quot;
&quot; When , where , how ? &quot;
asked Jo , in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity , for she could not realize it a particle .
&quot; Six weeks ago , at the American <unk> &apos;s , in Paris ; a very quiet wedding , of course , for even in our happiness we didn &apos;t forget dear little Beth . &quot;
Jo put her hand in his as he said that , and Laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow , which he remembered well .
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you let us know afterward ? &quot;
asked Jo , in a <unk> tone , when they had sat quite still a minute .
&quot; We wanted to surprise you ; we thought we were coming directly home , at first ; but the dear old gentleman , as soon as we were married , found he couldn &apos;t be ready under a month , at least , and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked .
Amy had once called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home , so we went there , and were as happy as people are but once in their lives .
My faith !
wasn &apos;t it love among the roses ! &quot;
Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute , and Jo was glad of it ; for the fact that he told her these things so freely and naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten .
She tried to draw away her hand ; but , as if he guessed the thought that <unk> the <unk> impulse , Laurie held it fast , and said , with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before , -- &quot; Jo , dear , I want to say one thing , and then we &apos;ll put it by forever .
As I told you in my letter , when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me , I never shall stop loving you ; but the love is altered , and I have learned to see that it is better as it is .
Amy and you change places in my heart , that &apos;s all .
I think it was meant to be so , and would have come about naturally , if I had waited , as you tried to make me ; but I never could be patient , and so I got a <unk> .
I was a boy then , <unk> and violent ; and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake .
For it _ was _ one , Jo , as you said , and I found it out , after making a fool of myself .
Upon my word , I was so tumbled up in my mind , at one time , that I didn &apos;t know which I loved best , you or Amy , and tried to love both alike ; but I couldn &apos;t , and when I saw her in Switzerland , everything seemed to clear up all at once .
You both got into your right places , and I felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new ; that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife Amy , and love them both dearly .
Will you believe it , and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll believe it , with all my heart ; but , Teddy , we never can be boy and girl again : the happy old times can &apos;t come back , and we mustn &apos;t expect it .
We are man and woman now , with sober work to do , for <unk> is over , and we must give up <unk> .
I &apos;m sure you feel this ; I see the change in you , and you &apos;ll find it in me .
I shall miss my boy , but I shall love the man as much , and admire him more , because he means to be what I hoped he would .
We can &apos;t be little <unk> any longer , but we will be brother and sister , to love and help one another all our lives , won &apos;t we , Laurie ? &quot;
He did not say a word , but took the hand she offered him , and laid his face down on it for a minute , feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion , there had <unk> a beautiful , strong friendship to bless them both .
Presently Jo said cheerfully , for she didn &apos;t want the coming home to be a sad one , -- &quot; I can &apos;t make it true that you children are really married , and going to set up housekeeping .
Why , it seems only yesterday that I was <unk> Amy &apos;s pinafore , and pulling your hair when you teased .
Mercy me , how time does fly ! &quot;
&quot; As one of the children is older than yourself , you needn &apos;t talk so like a grandma .
I flatter myself I &apos;m a &apos; gentleman <unk> , &apos; as <unk> said of David ; and when you see Amy , you &apos;ll find her rather a precocious infant , &quot; said Laurie , looking amused at her maternal air .
&quot; You may be a little older in years , but I &apos;m ever so much older in feeling , Teddy .
Women always are ; and this last year has been such a hard one that I feel forty . &quot;
&quot; Poor Jo !
we left you to bear it alone , while we went <unk> .
You _ are _ older ; here &apos;s a line , and there &apos;s another ; unless you smile , your eyes look sad , and when I touched the cushion , just now , I found a tear on it .
You &apos;ve had a great deal to bear , and had to bear it all alone .
What a selfish <unk> I &apos;ve been ! &quot;
and Laurie pulled his own hair , with a remorseful look .
But Jo only turned over the <unk> pillow , and answered , in a tone which she tried to make quite cheerful , -- &quot; No , I had father and mother to help me , the dear babies to comfort me , and the thought that you and Amy were safe and happy , to make the troubles here easier to bear .
I _ am _ lonely , sometimes , but I dare say it &apos;s good for me , and-- &quot; &quot; You never shall be again , &quot; broke in Laurie , putting his arm about her , as if to fence out every human ill . &quot; Amy and I can &apos;t get on without you , so you must come and teach &apos; the children &apos; to keep house , and go halves in everything , just as we used to do , and let us pet you , and all be <unk> happy and friendly together . &quot;
&quot; If I shouldn &apos;t be in the way , it would be very pleasant .
I begin to feel quite young already ; for , somehow , all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came .
You always were a comfort , Teddy ; &quot; and Jo leaned her head on his shoulder , just as she did years ago , when Beth lay ill , and Laurie told her to hold on to him .
He looked down at her , wondering if she remembered the time , but Jo was smiling to herself , as if , in truth , her troubles _ had _ all vanished at his coming .
&quot; You are the same Jo still , dropping tears about one minute , and laughing the next .
You look a little wicked now ; what is it , grandma ? &quot;
&quot; I was wondering how you and Amy get on together . &quot;
&quot; Like angels ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , of course , at first ; but which rules ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t mind telling you that she does , now ; at least I let her think so , --it <unk> her , you know .
By and by we shall take turns , for marriage , they say , halves one &apos;s rights and <unk> one &apos;s duties . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll go on as you begin , and Amy will rule you all the days of your life . &quot;
&quot; Well , she does it so <unk> that I don &apos;t think I shall mind much .
She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well ; in fact , I rather like it , for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a <unk> of silk , and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while . &quot;
&quot; That ever I should live to see you a <unk> husband and enjoying it ! &quot;
cried Jo , with uplifted hands .
It was good to see Laurie <unk> his shoulders , and smile with masculine scorn at that <unk> , as he replied , with his &quot; high and mighty &quot; air , -- &quot; Amy is too well-bred for that , and I am not the sort of man to <unk> to it .
My wife and I respect ourselves and one another too much ever to <unk> or quarrel . &quot;
Jo liked that , and thought the new dignity very becoming , but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man , and regret mingled with her pleasure .
&quot; I am sure of that ; Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to .
She is the sun and I the wind , in the fable , and the sun managed the man best , you remember . &quot;
&quot; She can blow him up as well as shine on him , &quot; laughed Laurie .
&quot; Such a lecture as I got at Nice !
I give you my word it was a deal worse than any of your <unk> , --a regular <unk> .
I &apos;ll tell you all about it <unk> , -- _ she _ never will , because , after telling me that she <unk> and was ashamed of me , she lost her heart to the <unk> party and married the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What <unk> !
Well , if she <unk> you , come to me , and I &apos;ll defend you . &quot;
&quot; I look as if I needed it , don &apos;t I ? &quot;
said Laurie , getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the <unk> to the rapturous , as Amy &apos;s voice was heard calling , -- &quot; Where is she ?
Where &apos;s my dear old Jo ? &quot;
In <unk> the whole family , and every one was hugged and kissed all over again , and , after several vain attempts , the three <unk> were set down to be looked at and exulted over .
Mr. Laurence , <unk> and hearty as ever , was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour , for the <unk> seemed to be nearly gone , and the old-fashioned <unk> had received a polish which made it <unk> than ever .
It was good to see him beam at &quot; my children , &quot; as he called the young pair ; it was better still to see Amy pay him the <unk> duty and affection which <unk> won his old heart ; and best of all , to watch Laurie <unk> about the two , as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made .
The minute she put her eyes upon Amy , Meg became conscious that her own dress hadn &apos;t a <unk> air , that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely <unk> by young Mrs. Laurence , and that &quot; her ladyship &quot; was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman .
Jo thought , as she watched the pair , &quot; How well they look together !
I was right , and Laurie has found the beautiful , accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old Jo , and be a pride , not a torment to him . &quot;
Mrs. March and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces , for they saw that their <unk> had done well , not only in worldly things , but the better wealth of love , confidence , and happiness .
For Amy &apos;s face was full of the soft <unk> which <unk> a peaceful heart , her voice had a new tenderness in it , and the cool , prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity , both womanly and <unk> .
No little <unk> <unk> it , and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace , for it <unk> her at once with the <unk> sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become .
&quot; Love has done much for our little girl , &quot; said her mother softly .
&quot; She has had a good example before her all her life , my dear , &quot; Mr. March whispered back , with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him .
Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her &quot; pitty aunty , &quot; but <unk> herself like a <unk> to the wonderful ch ? <unk> full of delightful charms .
Demi paused to consider the new <unk> before he <unk> himself by the rash <unk> of a bribe , which took the <unk> form of a family of wooden bears from <unk> .
A <unk> movement produced an <unk> <unk> , however , for Laurie knew where to have him .
&quot; Young man , when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face : now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman ; &quot; and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul .
&#91; Illustration : The tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew &#93; &quot; <unk> if she ain &apos;t in silk from head to foot ?
<unk> &apos;t it a <unk> &apos; sight to see her <unk> &apos; there as fine as a <unk> , and hear folks calling little Amy , <unk> .
Laurence ? &quot;
muttered old Hannah , who could not resist frequent &quot; <unk> &quot; through the <unk> as she set the table in a most decidedly <unk> manner .
Mercy on us , how they did talk !
first one , then the other , then all burst out together , trying to tell the history of three years in half an hour .
It was fortunate that tea was at hand , to produce a lull and provide refreshment , for they would have been <unk> and faint if they had gone on much longer .
Such a happy procession as <unk> away into the little dining-room !
Mr. March proudly escorted &quot; Mrs. Laurence ; &quot; Mrs. March as proudly leaned on the arm of &quot; my son ; &quot; the old gentleman took Jo , with a whispered &quot; You must be my girl now , &quot; and a glance at the empty corner by the fire , that made Jo whisper back , with trembling lips , &quot; I &apos;ll try to fill her place , sir . &quot;
The twins pranced behind , feeling that the <unk> was at hand , for every one was so busy with the <unk> that they were left to revel at their own sweet will , and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity .
Didn &apos;t they steal <unk> of tea , stuff gingerbread _ <unk> <unk> _ , get a hot <unk> apiece , and , as a crowning <unk> , didn &apos;t they each whisk a captivating little <unk> into their tiny pockets , there to <unk> and <unk> <unk> , teaching them that both human nature and <unk> are frail ?
<unk> with the guilty consciousness of the <unk> <unk> , and fearing that Dodo &apos;s sharp eyes would <unk> the thin <unk> of <unk> and <unk> which hid their <unk> , the little sinners <unk> themselves to &quot; Dranpa , &quot; who hadn &apos;t his spectacles on .
Amy , who was handed about like <unk> , returned to the parlor on Father Laurence &apos;s arm ; the others <unk> off as before , and this arrangement left Jo <unk> .
She did not mind it at the minute , for she <unk> to answer Hannah &apos;s eager inquiry , -- &quot; Will Miss Amy ride in her <unk> ( _ <unk> ? _ ) , and use all them lovely silver dishes that &apos;s stored away over <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;t wonder if she drove six white horses , ate off gold plate , and wore diamonds and <unk> every day .
Teddy thinks nothing too good for her , &quot; returned Jo with infinite satisfaction .
&quot; No more there is !
Will you have <unk> or <unk> for breakfast ? &quot;
asked Hannah , who wisely mingled poetry and <unk> .
&quot; I don &apos;t care ; &quot; and Jo shut the door , feeling that food was an <unk> <unk> just then .
She stood a minute looking at the party <unk> above , and , as Demi &apos;s short <unk> legs <unk> up the last <unk> , a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes , as if to find something to <unk> upon , for even Teddy had deserted her .
If she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer , she would not have said to herself , &quot; I &apos;ll weep a little weep when I go to bed ; it won &apos;t do to be dismal now . &quot;
Then she drew her hand over her eyes , --for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was , --and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the <unk> .
She opened it with hospitable haste , and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her ; for there stood a tall , <unk> gentleman , beaming on her from the <unk> like a midnight sun .
&quot; O Mr. Bhaer , I _ am _ so glad to see you ! &quot;
cried Jo , with a <unk> , as if she feared the night would <unk> him up before she could get him in .
&#91; Illustration : O Mr. Bhaer , I am so glad to see you &#93; &quot; And I to see Miss Marsch , --but no , you haf a <unk> &quot; and the Professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them .
&quot; No , we haven &apos;t , only the family .
My sister and friends have just come home , and we are all very happy .
Come in , and make one of us . &quot;
Though a very social man , I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone <unk> away , and come again another day ; but how could he , when Jo shut the door behind him , and <unk> him of his hat ?
Perhaps her face had something to do with it , for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him , and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man , whose welcome far <unk> his <unk> hopes .
&quot; If I shall not be <unk> de <unk> , I will so gladly see them all .
You haf been ill , my friend ? &quot;
He put the question abruptly , for , as Jo hung up his coat , the light fell on her face , and he saw a change in it .
&quot; Not ill , but tired and sorrowful .
We have had trouble since I saw you last . &quot;
&quot; Ah , yes , I know .
My heart was sore for you when I heard that ; &quot; and he shook hands again , with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes , the grasp of the big , warm hand .
&quot; Father , mother , this is my friend , Professor Bhaer , &quot; she said , with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a <unk> and opened the door with a flourish .
If the stranger had had any doubts about his reception , they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received .
Every one greeted him kindly , for Jo &apos;s sake at first , but very soon they liked him for his own .
They could not help it , for he carried the talisman that <unk> all hearts , and these simple people warmed to him at once , feeling even the more friendly because he was poor ; for poverty <unk> those who live above it , and is a sure <unk> to truly hospitable spirits .
Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveller who <unk> at a strange door , and , when it <unk> , finds himself at home .
The children went to him like bees to a <unk> ; and , <unk> themselves on each knee , proceeded to <unk> him by <unk> his pockets , pulling his beard , and <unk> his watch , with <unk> audacity .
The women telegraphed their <unk> to one another , and Mr. March , feeling that he had got a <unk> spirit , opened his <unk> stores for his guest &apos;s benefit , while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk , but said not a word , and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep .
If Jo had not been otherwise engaged , Laurie &apos;s behavior would have amused her ; for a faint <unk> , not of <unk> , but something like suspicion , caused that gentleman to stand <unk> at first , and observe the new-comer with brotherly <unk> .
But it did not last long .
He got interested in spite of himself , and , before he knew it , was drawn into the circle ; for Mr. Bhaer talked well in this <unk> atmosphere , and did himself justice .
He seldom spoke to Laurie , but he looked at him often , and a shadow would pass across his face , as if <unk> his own lost youth , as he watched the young man in his prime .
Then his eye would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it ; but Jo had her own eyes to take care of , and , feeling that they could not be trusted , she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting , like a model maiden aunt .
A <unk> glance now and then <unk> her like <unk> of fresh water after a dusty walk , for the <unk> peeps showed her several <unk> omens .
Mr. Bhaer &apos;s face had lost the absent-minded expression , and looked all alive with interest in the present moment , actually young and handsome , she thought , forgetting to <unk> him with Laurie , as she usually did strange men , to their great <unk> .
Then he seemed quite inspired , though the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , to which the conversation had strayed , might not be considered an <unk> <unk> .
Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument , and thought to herself , as she watched her father &apos;s absorbed face , &quot; How he would enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day ! &quot;
<unk> , Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black , which made him look more like a gentleman than ever .
His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed , but didn &apos;t stay in order long , for , in exciting moments , he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do ; and Jo liked it <unk> erect better than flat , because she thought it gave his fine forehead a <unk> aspect .
Poor Jo , how she did <unk> that plain man , as she sat knitting away so quietly , yet letting nothing escape her , not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold <unk> in his <unk> <unk> !
&quot; Dear old fellow !
He couldn &apos;t have got himself up with more care if he &apos;d been going <unk> , &quot; said Jo to herself ; and then a sudden thought , born of the words , made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball , and go down after it to hide her face .
The man ? <unk> did not succeed as well as she expected , however ; for , though just in the act of setting fire to a <unk> , the Professor dropped his <unk> , <unk> speaking , and made a <unk> after the little blue ball .
Of course they <unk> their heads <unk> together , saw stars , and both came up flushed and laughing , without the ball , to <unk> their seats , wishing they had not left them .
Nobody knew where the evening went to ; for Hannah skilfully <unk> the babies at an early hour , nodding like two rosy <unk> , and Mr. Laurence went home to rest .
The others sat round the fire , talking away , utterly regardless of the <unk> of time , till Meg , whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of bed , and Demi set his <unk> <unk> studying the <unk> of <unk> , made a move to go .
&quot; We must have our sing , in the good old way , for we are all together again once more , &quot; said Jo , feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the <unk> emotions of her soul .
They were not _ all _ there .
But no one found the words <unk> or <unk> ; for Beth still seemed among them , a peaceful presence , invisible , but dearer than ever , since death could not break the household <unk> that love made <unk> .
The little chair stood in its old place ; the tidy basket , with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew &quot; so heavy , &quot; was still on its accustomed shelf ; the beloved instrument , seldom touched now , had not been moved ; and above it Beth &apos;s face , serene and smiling , as in the early days , looked down upon them , seeming to say , &quot; Be happy .
I am here . &quot;
&quot; <unk> something , Amy .
Let them hear how much you have improved , &quot; said Laurie , with pardonable pride in his promising pupil .
But Amy whispered , with full eyes , as she <unk> the faded stool , -- &quot; Not to-night , dear .
I can &apos;t show off to-night . &quot;
But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill ; for she sung Beth &apos;s songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught , and touched the listeners &apos; hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her .
The room was very still , when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth &apos;s favorite hymn .
It was hard to say , -- &quot; <unk> <unk> no sorrow that heaven cannot <unk> ; &quot; and Amy leaned against her husband , who stood behind her , feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth &apos;s kiss .
&quot; Now , we must finish with <unk> &apos;s song ; for Mr. Bhaer <unk> that , &quot; said Jo , before the pause grew painful .
And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified &quot; Hem ! &quot;
as he <unk> into the corner where Jo stood , saying , -- &quot; You will sing with me ?
We go excellently well together . &quot;
A pleasing <unk> , by the way ; for Jo had no more idea of music than a <unk> .
But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a whole opera , and warbled away , <unk> regardless of time and tune .
It didn &apos;t much matter ; for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German , heartily and well ; and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum , that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone .
&#91; Illustration : Mr. Bhaer sang heartily &#93; &quot; <unk> <unk> thou the land where the <unk> <unk> , &quot; used to be the Professor &apos;s favorite line , for &quot; <unk> land &quot; meant Germany to him ; but now he seemed to <unk> , with peculiar warmth and melody , upon the words , -- &quot; There , oh there , might I with thee , O my beloved , go ! &quot;
and one <unk> was so <unk> by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land , and would joyfully <unk> <unk> whenever he liked .
The song was considered a great success , and the <unk> retired covered with <unk> .
But a few minutes afterward , he forgot his manners entirely , and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet ; for she had been introduced simply as &quot; my sister , &quot; and no one had called her by her new name since he came .
He forgot himself still further when Laurie said , in his most gracious manner , at parting , -- &quot; My wife and I are very glad to meet you , sir .
Please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way . &quot;
Then the Professor thanked him so heartily , and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction , that Laurie thought him the most delightfully <unk> old fellow he ever met .
&quot; I too shall go ; but I shall gladly come again , if you will gif me leave , dear <unk> , for a little business in the city will keep me here some days . &quot;
He spoke to Mrs. March , but he looked at Jo ; and the mother &apos;s voice gave as cordial an <unk> as did the daughter &apos;s eyes ; for Mrs. March was not so blind to her children &apos;s interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed .
&quot; I suspect that is a wise man , &quot; <unk> Mr. March , with placid satisfaction , from the <unk> , after the last guest had gone .
&quot; I know he is a good one , &quot; added Mrs. March , with decided <unk> , as she wound up the clock .
&quot; I thought you &apos;d like him , &quot; was all Jo said , as she slipped away to her bed .
She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city , and finally decided that he had been <unk> to some great honor , somewhere , but had been too modest to mention the fact .
If she had seen his face when , safe in his own room , he looked at the picture of a severe and <unk> young lady , with a good deal of hair , who appeared to be <unk> darkly into <unk> , it might have thrown some light upon the subject , especially when he turned off the <unk> , and kissed the picture in the dark .
&#91; Illustration : Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother &apos;s lap &#93; <unk> .
MY <unk> AND <unk> .
&quot; Please , Madam Mother , could you lend me my wife for half an hour ?
The <unk> has come , and I &apos;ve been making <unk> of Amy &apos;s Paris <unk> , trying to find some things I want , &quot; said Laurie , coming in the next day to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother &apos;s lap , as if being made &quot; the baby &quot; again .
&quot; <unk> .
Go , dear ; I forget that you have any home but this , &quot; and Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the <unk> , as if asking pardon for her maternal <unk> .
&quot; I shouldn &apos;t have come over if I could have helped it ; but I can &apos;t get on without my little woman any more than a-- &quot; &quot; <unk> can without wind , &quot; suggested Jo , as he paused for a <unk> ; Jo had grown quite her own <unk> self again since Teddy came home .
&quot; <unk> ; for Amy keeps me pointing <unk> <unk> most of the time , with only an occasional <unk> round to the <unk> , and I haven &apos;t had an <unk> spell since I was married ; don &apos;t know anything about the <unk> , but am altogether <unk> and <unk> , hey , my lady ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> weather so far ; I don &apos;t know how long it will last , but I &apos;m not afraid of <unk> , for I &apos;m learning how to sail my ship .
Come home , dear , and I &apos;ll find your <unk> ; I suppose that &apos;s what you are rummaging after among my things .
Men are _ so _ helpless , mother , &quot; said Amy , with a matronly air , which delighted her husband .
&quot; What are you going to do with <unk> after you get settled ? &quot;
asked Jo , <unk> Amy &apos;s cloak as she used to button her <unk> .
&quot; We have our plans ; we don &apos;t mean to say much about them yet , because we are such very new <unk> , but we don &apos;t intend to be idle .
I &apos;m going into business with a devotion that shall delight grandfather , and prove to him that I &apos;m not spoilt .
I need something of the sort to keep me steady .
I &apos;m tired of <unk> , and mean to work like a man . &quot;
&quot; And Amy , what is she going to do ? &quot;
asked Mrs. March , well pleased at Laurie &apos;s decision , and the energy with which he spoke .
&quot; After doing the civil all round , and airing our best bonnet , we shall astonish you by the elegant <unk> of our mansion , the brilliant society we shall draw about us , and the <unk> influence we shall exert over the world at large .
That &apos;s about it , isn &apos;t it , Madame <unk> ? <unk> ? &quot;
asked Laurie , with a <unk> look at Amy .
&quot; Time will show .
Come away , <unk> , and don &apos;t shock my family by calling me names before their faces , &quot; answered Amy , resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a _ salon _ as a queen of society .
&quot; How happy those children seem together ! &quot;
observed Mr. March , finding it difficult to become absorbed in his <unk> after the young couple had gone .
&quot; Yes , and I think it will last , &quot; added Mrs. March , with the <unk> expression of a <unk> who has brought a ship safely into <unk> .
&quot; I know it will .
Happy Amy ! &quot;
and Jo sighed , then smiled <unk> as Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient <unk> .
<unk> in the evening , when his mind had been set at rest about the <unk> , Laurie said suddenly to his wife , who was <unk> about , arranging her new art treasures , -- &quot; Mrs.
Laurence . &quot;
&quot; My lord ! &quot;
&quot; That man <unk> to marry our Jo ! &quot;
&quot; I hope so ; don &apos;t you , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Well , my love , I consider him a trump , in the fullest sense of that expressive word , but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer . &quot;
&quot; Now , Laurie , don &apos;t be too fastidious and <unk> .
If they love one another it doesn &apos;t matter a particle how old they are nor how poor .
Women _ never _ should marry for <unk> &quot; Amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her , and looked at her husband , who replied , with <unk> gravity , -- &quot; <unk> not , though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes .
If my memory <unk> me , you once thought it your duty to make a rich match ; that accounts , perhaps , for your <unk> a <unk> like me . &quot;
&quot; O my dearest boy , don &apos;t , don &apos;t say that !
I forgot you were rich when I said &apos; Yes . &apos;
I &apos;d have married you if you hadn &apos;t a penny , and I sometimes wish you _ were _ poor that I might show how much I love you ; &quot; and Amy , who was very dignified in public and very fond in private , gave <unk> proofs of the truth of her words .
&quot; You don &apos;t really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be once , do you ?
It would break my heart if you didn &apos;t believe that I &apos;d gladly pull in the same boat with you , even if you had to get your living by <unk> on the lake . &quot;
&quot; Am I an <unk> and a <unk> ?
How could I think so , when you refused a richer man for me , and won &apos;t let me give you half I want to now , when I have the right ?
Girls do it every day , poor things , and are taught to think it is their only <unk> ; but you had better lessons , and , though I trembled for you at one time , I was not disappointed , for the daughter was true to the mother &apos;s teaching .
I told mamma so yesterday , and she looked as glad and grateful as if I &apos;d given her a check for a million , to be spent in charity .
You are not listening to my moral remarks , Mrs. Laurence ; &quot; and Laurie paused , for Amy &apos;s eyes had an absent look , though fixed upon his face .
&quot; Yes , I am , and admiring the <unk> in your chin at the same time .
I don &apos;t wish to make you vain , but I must confess that I &apos;m prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money .
Don &apos;t laugh , but your nose is _ such _ a comfort to me ; &quot; and Amy softly caressed the <unk> feature with artistic satisfaction .
Laurie had received many compliments in his life , but never one that suited him better , as he plainly showed , though he did laugh at his wife &apos;s peculiar taste , while she said slowly , -- &quot; May I ask you a question , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Of course you may . &quot;
&quot; Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr.
Bhaer ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , that &apos;s the trouble , is it ?
I thought there was something in the <unk> that didn &apos;t suit you .
Not being a dog in the <unk> , but the happiest fellow alive , I assure you I can dance at Jo &apos;s wedding with a heart as light as my heels .
Do you doubt it , my darling ? &quot;
Amy looked up at him , and was satisfied ; her last little jealous fear vanished forever , and she thanked him , with a face full of love and confidence .
&quot; I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor .
Couldn &apos;t we <unk> a rich relation , who shall <unk> die out there in Germany , and leave him a tidy little fortune ? &quot;
said Laurie , when they began to pace up and down the long drawing-room , arm-in-arm , as they were fond of doing , in memory of the chateau garden .
&#91; Illustration : They began to pace up and down &#93; &quot; Jo would find us out , and spoil it all ; she is very proud of him , just as he is , and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing . &quot;
&quot; Bless her dear heart !
she won &apos;t think so when she has a literary husband , and a dozen little <unk> and <unk> to support .
We won &apos;t interfere now , but watch our chance , and do them a good turn in spite of themselves .
I owe Jo for a part of my education , and she <unk> in people &apos;s paying their honest debts , so I &apos;ll get round her in that way . &quot;
&quot; How delightful it is to be able to help others , isn &apos;t it ?
That was always one of my dreams , to have the power of giving freely ; and , thanks to you , the dream has come true . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
we &apos;ll do quantities of good , won &apos;t we ?
There &apos;s one sort of poverty that I particularly like to help .
<unk> <unk> get taken care of , but poor <unk> fare badly , because they won &apos;t ask , and people don &apos;t dare to offer charity ; yet there are a <unk> ways of helping them , if one only knows how to do it so <unk> that it does not <unk> .
I must say , I like to serve a <unk> gentleman better than a <unk> <unk> ; I suppose it &apos;s wrong , but I do , though it is harder . &quot;
&quot; Because it takes a gentleman to do it , &quot; added the other member of the domestic admiration society .
&quot; Thank you , I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t deserve that pretty compliment .
But I was going to say that while I was <unk> about abroad , I saw a good many <unk> young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices , and <unk> real hardships , that they might realize their dreams .
<unk> fellows , some of them , working like heroes , poor and <unk> , but so full of courage , patience , and ambition , that I was ashamed of myself , and longed to give them a right good lift .
Those are people whom it &apos;s a satisfaction to help , for if they &apos;ve got genius , it &apos;s an honor to be allowed to serve them , and not let it be lost or <unk> for want of <unk> to keep the pot <unk> ; if they haven &apos;t , it &apos;s a pleasure to comfort the poor souls , and keep them from despair when they find it out . &quot;
&quot; Yes , indeed ; and there &apos;s another class who can &apos;t ask , and who suffer in silence .
I know something of it , for I belonged to it before you made a princess of me , as the king does the <unk> in the old story .
<unk> girls have a hard time , Laurie , and often have to see youth , health , and precious opportunities go by , just for want of a little help at the right minute .
People have been very kind to me ; and whenever I see girls struggling along , as we used to do , I want to put out my hand and help them , as I was helped . &quot;
&quot; And so you shall , like an angel as you are ! &quot;
cried Laurie , resolving , with a glow of <unk> <unk> , to found and <unk> an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic <unk> .
&quot; Rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves , or let their money <unk> for others to waste .
It &apos;s not half so sensible to leave <unk> when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive , and enjoy making one &apos;s <unk> happy with it .
We &apos;ll have a good time ourselves , and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a generous taste .
Will you be a little <unk> , going about <unk> a big basket of comforts , and filling it up with good <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; With all my heart , if you will be a brave St. <unk> , stopping , as you ride gallantly through the world , to share your cloak with the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a bargain , and we shall get the best of it ! &quot;
So the young pair shook hands upon it , and then <unk> happily on again , feeling that their pleasant home was more <unk> because they hoped to brighten other homes , believing that their own feet would walk more <unk> along the <unk> path before them , if they smoothed rough ways for other feet , and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; <unk> .
<unk> AND <unk> .
I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble <unk> of the March family , without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious and important members of it .
Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of discretion ; for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights , and get them , too , which is more than many of their elders do .
If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoilt by <unk> , it was these <unk> <unk> .
Of course they were the most remarkable children ever born , as will be shown when I mention that they walked at eight months , talked <unk> at twelve months , and at two years they took their places at table , and behaved with a propriety which charmed all <unk> .
At three , Daisy demanded a &quot; <unk> , &quot; and actually made a bag with four stitches in it ; she likewise set up housekeeping in the <unk> , and managed a <unk> <unk> with a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah &apos;s eyes , while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather , who invented a new <unk> of teaching the <unk> by <unk> the letters with his arms and legs , thus <unk> gymnastics for head and heels .
The boy early <unk> a <unk> genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother , for he tried to imitate every <unk> he saw , and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition , with his &quot; <unk> , &quot; --a mysterious <unk> of string , chairs , <unk> , and <unk> , for <unk> to go &quot; wound and wound ; &quot; also a basket hung over the back of a big chair , in which he <unk> tried to <unk> his too confiding sister , who , with feminine devotion , allowed her little head to be <unk> till rescued , when the young <unk> indignantly <unk> , &quot; Why , marmar , <unk> &apos;s my <unk> , and me &apos;s trying to pull her up . &quot;
Though utterly unlike in character , the twins got on remarkably well together , and seldom <unk> more than <unk> a day .
Of course , Demi tyrannized over Daisy , and gallantly defended her from every other <unk> ; while Daisy made a <unk> of herself , and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world .
A rosy , <unk> , sunshiny little soul was Daisy , who found her way to everybody &apos;s heart , and nestled there .
One of the captivating children , who seem made to be kissed and cuddled , adorned and adored like little <unk> , and produced for general <unk> on all festive occasions .
Her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small <unk> had not kept her delightfully human .
It was all fair weather in her world , and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little <unk> to look out , and say , no matter whether it <unk> or shone , &quot; Oh , pitty day , oh , pitty day ! &quot;
Every one was a friend , and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> became faithful <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : Me loves evvybody &#93; &quot; Me loves evvybody , &quot; she once said , opening her arms , with her <unk> in one hand , and her <unk> in the other , as if eager to embrace and <unk> the whole world .
As she grew , her mother began to feel that the Dove-cote would be blest by the presence of an <unk> as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home , and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had <unk> an angel <unk> .
Her grandfather often called her &quot; Beth , &quot; and her grandmother watched over her with <unk> devotion , as if trying to atone for some past mistake , which no eye but her own could see .
Demi , like a true Yankee , was of an inquiring turn , wanting to know everything , and often getting much disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual &quot; What for ? &quot;
He also possessed a philosophic bent , to the great delight of his grandfather , who used to hold <unk> conversations with him , in which the precocious pupil occasionally <unk> his teacher , to the <unk> satisfaction of the <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : What makes my legs go , dranpa ? &#93;
&quot; What makes my legs go , dranpa ? &quot;
asked the young <unk> , surveying those active <unk> of his frame with a meditative air , while resting after a <unk> frolic one night .
&quot; It &apos;s your little mind , Demi , &quot; replied the <unk> , stroking the yellow head respectfully .
&quot; What is a little mine ? &quot;
&quot; It is something which makes your body move , as the spring made the <unk> go in my watch when I showed it to you . &quot;
&quot; <unk> me ; I want to see it go wound . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t do that any more than you could open the watch .
God winds you up , and you go till He stops you . &quot;
&quot; Does I ? &quot;
and Demi &apos;s brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought .
&quot; Is I wounded up like the watch ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; but I can &apos;t show you how ; for it is done when we don &apos;t see . &quot;
Demi felt of his back , as if expecting to find it like that of the watch , and then gravely <unk> , -- &quot; I <unk> <unk> does it when I &apos;s asleep . &quot;
A careful explanation followed , to which he listened so <unk> that his anxious grandmother said , -- &quot; My dear , do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby ?
He &apos;s getting great <unk> over his eyes , and learning to ask the most <unk> questions . &quot;
&quot; If he is old enough to ask the questions he is old enough to receive true answers .
I am not putting the thoughts into his head , but helping him <unk> those already there .
These children are wiser than we are , and I have no doubt the boy <unk> every word I have said to him .
Now , Demi , tell me where you keep your mind ? &quot;
If the boy had replied like <unk> , &quot; By the gods , <unk> , I cannot tell , &quot; his grandfather would not have been surprised ; but when , after standing a moment on one leg , like a meditative young <unk> , he answered , in a tone of calm conviction , &quot; In my little <unk> , &quot; the old gentleman could only join in grandma &apos;s laugh , and <unk> the class in <unk> .
There might have been cause for maternal anxiety , if Demi had not given <unk> proofs that he was a true boy , as well as a budding <unk> ; for , often , after a discussion which caused Hannah to <unk> , with <unk> nods , &quot; That child ain &apos;t long for this world , &quot; he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with which dear , dirty , naughty little rascals <unk> and delight their parents &apos; souls .
Meg made many moral rules , and tried to keep them ; but what mother was ever <unk> against the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , or the tranquil audacity of the <unk> men and women who so early show themselves accomplished <unk> <unk> ?
&quot; No more raisins , Demi , they &apos;ll make you sick , &quot; says mamma to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with <unk> regularity on <unk> day .
&quot; Me likes to be sick . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to have you , so run away and help Daisy make <unk> . &quot;
He reluctantly <unk> , but his wrongs <unk> upon his spirit ; and , by and by , when an opportunity comes to <unk> them , he <unk> mamma by a <unk> bargain .
&quot; Now you have been good children , and I &apos;ll play anything you like , &quot; says Meg , as she <unk> her <unk> <unk> upstairs , when the pudding is safely <unk> in the pot .
&quot; Truly , marmar ? &quot;
<unk> Demi , with a brilliant idea in his <unk> head .
&quot; Yes , truly ; anything you say , &quot; <unk> the short-sighted parent , preparing herself to sing &quot; The Three Little <unk> &quot; half a dozen times over , or to take her family to &quot; <unk> a penny <unk> , &quot; regardless of wind or <unk> .
But Demi corners her by the cool reply , -- &quot; Then we &apos;ll go and eat up all the raisins . &quot;
Aunt Dodo was chief <unk> and _ <unk> _ of both children , and the <unk> turned the little house topsy-turvy .
Aunt Amy was as yet only a name to them , Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory , but Aunt Dodo was a living <unk> , and they made the most of her , for which compliment she was deeply grateful .
But when Mr. Bhaer came , Jo neglected her <unk> , and dismay and <unk> fell upon their little souls .
Daisy , who was fond of going about <unk> kisses , lost her best <unk> and became <unk> ; Demi , with <unk> <unk> , soon discovered that Dodo liked to play with &quot; the <unk> &quot; better than she did with him ; but , though hurt , he concealed his anguish , for he hadn &apos;t the heart to insult a <unk> who kept a mine of <unk> in his <unk> , and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent <unk> .
Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as <unk> ; but Demi didn &apos;t see it in that light , and continued to <unk> the &quot; <unk> &quot; with pensive <unk> , while Daisy <unk> her small affections upon him at the third call , and considered his shoulder her <unk> , his arm her refuge , his gifts treasures of <unk> worth .
<unk> are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young <unk> of ladies whom they honor with their regard ; but this <unk> <unk> sits <unk> upon them , and does not deceive anybody a particle .
Mr. Bhaer &apos;s devotion was sincere , however likewise effective , --for <unk> is the best <unk> in love as in law ; he was one of the men who are at home with children , and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one .
His business , whatever it was , <unk> him from day to day , but evening seldom failed to bring him out to <unk> , he always asked for Mr. March , so I suppose _ he _ was the attraction .
The excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was , and revelled in long <unk> with the <unk> spirit , till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him .
Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study , astonished by the spectacle that met his eye .
<unk> upon the floor lay Mr. March , with his respectable legs in the air , and beside him , likewise <unk> , was Demi , trying to imitate the attitude with his own short , <unk> legs , both <unk> so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators , till Mr. Bhaer laughed his <unk> laugh , and Jo cried out , with a scandalized face , -- &quot; Father , father , here &apos;s the Professor ! &quot;
Down went the black legs and up came the gray head , as the <unk> said , with <unk> dignity , -- &quot; Good evening , Mr. Bhaer .
Excuse me for a moment ; we are just finishing our lesson .
Now , Demi , make the letter and tell its name . &quot;
&quot; I knows him ! &quot;
and , after a few <unk> efforts , the red legs took the shape of a pair of <unk> , and the intelligent pupil triumphantly <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s a We , dranpa , it &apos;s a We ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Dranpa , it &apos;s a We &#93; &quot; He &apos;s a born Weller , &quot; laughed Jo , as her parent gathered himself up , and her nephew tried to stand on his head , as the only <unk> of <unk> his satisfaction that school was over .
&quot; What have you been at to-day , <unk> ? <unk> ? &quot;
asked Mr. Bhaer , picking up the <unk> .
&quot; Me went to see little Mary . &quot;
&quot; And what did you there ? &quot;
&quot; I kissed her , &quot; began Demi , with artless frankness .
&quot; Prut !
thou <unk> early .
What did the little Mary say to that ? &quot;
asked Mr. Bhaer , <unk> to confess the young sinner , who stood upon his knee , <unk> the <unk> .
&quot; Oh , she liked it , and she kissed me , and I liked it .
_ Don &apos;t _ little boys like little girls ? &quot;
added Demi , with his mouth full , and an air of <unk> satisfaction .
&quot; You precocious <unk> !
Who put that into your head ? &quot;
said Jo , enjoying the innocent <unk> as much as the Professor .
&quot; &apos; <unk> &apos;t in mine head ; it &apos;s in mine <unk> , &quot; answered <unk> Demi , putting out his tongue , with a <unk> on it , thinking she alluded to <unk> , not ideas .
&quot; Thou <unk> save some for the little friend : <unk> to the sweet , <unk> ; &quot; and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some , with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the <unk> drunk by the gods .
Demi also saw the smile , was impressed by it , and <unk> inquired , -- &quot; Do great boys like great girls , too , &apos; <unk> ? &quot;
Like young Washington , Mr. Bhaer &quot; couldn &apos;t tell a lie ; &quot; so he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes , in a tone that made Mr. March put down his <unk> , glance at Jo &apos;s <unk> face , and then <unk> into his chair , looking as if the &quot; precocious <unk> &quot; had put an idea into _ his _ head that was both sweet and sour .
Why Dodo , when she caught him in the china-closet half an hour afterward , nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace , instead of shaking him for being there , and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big <unk> of bread and jelly , remained one of the <unk> over which Demi puzzled his small wits , and was forced to leave <unk> forever .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades &#93; <unk> .
UNDER THE <unk> .
While Laurie and Amy were taking <unk> <unk> over velvet <unk> , as they set their house in order , and planned a blissful future , Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort , along muddy <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
&quot; I always do take a walk toward evening , and I don &apos;t know why I should give it up , just because I often happen to meet the Professor on his way out , &quot; said Jo to herself , after two or three <unk> ; for , though there were two <unk> to Meg &apos;s , <unk> one she took she was sure to meet him , either going or returning .
He was always walking rapidly , and never seemed to see her till quite close , when he would look as if his short-sighted eyes had failed to <unk> the approaching lady till that moment .
Then , if she was going to Meg &apos;s , he always had something for the babies ; if her face was turned homeward , he had merely strolled down to see the river , and was just about returning , unless they were tired of his frequent calls .
Under the circumstances , what could Jo do but greet him <unk> , and invite him in ?
If she _ was _ tired of his visits , she concealed her <unk> with perfect skill , and took care that there should be coffee for supper , &quot; as <unk> mean Mr. <unk> &apos;t like tea . &quot;
By the second week , every one knew perfectly well what was going on , yet every one tried to look as if they were <unk> to the changes in Jo &apos;s face .
They never asked why she sang about her work , did up her hair three times a day , and got so <unk> with her evening exercise ; and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer , while talking philosophy with the father , was giving the daughter lessons in love .
Jo couldn &apos;t even lose her heart in a decorous manner , but <unk> tried to <unk> her feelings ; and , failing to do so , led a somewhat agitated life .
She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for <unk> , after her many and <unk> <unk> of independence .
Laurie was her especial dread ; but , thanks to the new <unk> , he behaved with praiseworthy propriety , never called Mr. Bhaer &quot; a capital old fellow &quot; in public , never alluded , in the <unk> manner , to Jo &apos;s improved appearance , or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor &apos;s hat on the Marches &apos; <unk> nearly every evening .
But he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of plate , with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate <unk> .
For a fortnight , the Professor came and went with <unk> regularity ; then he stayed away for three whole days , and made no sign , --a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober , and Jo to become pensive , at first , and <unk> for romance ! <unk> cross .
&quot; <unk> , I dare say , and gone home as suddenly as he came .
It &apos;s nothing to me , of course ; but I _ should _ think he would have come and bid us good-by , like a gentleman , &quot; she said to herself , with a despairing look at the gate , as she put on her things for the <unk> walk , one dull afternoon .
&quot; You &apos;d better take the little umbrella , dear ; it looks like rain , &quot; said her mother , observing that she had on her new bonnet , but not <unk> to the fact .
&quot; Yes , Marmee ; do you want anything in town ?
I &apos;ve got to run in and get some paper , &quot; returned Jo , pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother .
&quot; Yes ; I want some <unk> <unk> , a paper of number nine needles , and two <unk> of narrow lavender ribbon .
Have you got your thick boots on , and something warm under your cloak ? &quot;
&quot; I believe so , &quot; answered Jo absently .
&quot; If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer , bring him home to tea .
I quite long to see the dear man , &quot; added Mrs. March .
Jo heard _ that _ , but made no answer , except to kiss her mother , and walk rapidly away , thinking with a glow of gratitude , in spite of her <unk> , -- &quot; How good she is to me !
What _ do _ girls do who haven &apos;t any mothers to help them through their troubles ? &quot;
The <unk> stores were not down among the <unk> , banks , and <unk> <unk> , where gentlemen most do <unk> ; but Jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single <unk> , <unk> along as if waiting for some one , examining <unk> <unk> in one window and <unk> of <unk> in another with most <unk> interest ; tumbling over <unk> , being <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> by busy men who looked as if they wondered &quot; how the deuce she got there . &quot;
A drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from <unk> hopes to <unk> ribbons ; for the drops continued to fall , and , being a woman as well as a lover , she felt that , though it was too late to save her heart , she might her bonnet .
Now she remembered the little umbrella , which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off ; but regret was <unk> , and nothing could be done but borrow one or <unk> to a <unk> .
She looked up at the <unk> sky , down at the crimson bow already <unk> with black , forward along the muddy street , then one long , <unk> look behind , at a certain <unk> <unk> , with &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &amp; <unk> . &quot; over the door , and said to herself , with a <unk> reproachful air , -- &quot; It <unk> me right !
What business had I to put on all my best things and come philandering down here , hoping to see the Professor ?
Jo , I &apos;m ashamed of you !
No , you shall _ not _ go there to borrow an umbrella , or find out where he is , from his friends .
You shall <unk> away , and do your errands in the rain ; and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet , it &apos;s no more than you deserve .
Now then ! &quot;
With that she rushed across the street so <unk> that she <unk> escaped <unk> from a passing <unk> , and <unk> herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman , who said , &quot; I beg pardon , ma &apos;am , &quot; and looked mortally offended .
<unk> daunted , Jo <unk> herself , spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons , and , putting temptation behind her , hurried on , with increasing <unk> about the <unk> , and much <unk> of <unk> overhead .
The fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained <unk> above the <unk> bonnet , attracted her attention ; and , looking up , she saw Mr. Bhaer looking down .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> up she saw Mr. Bhaer &#93; &quot; I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many <unk> , and so fast through much mud .
What do you down here , my friend ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m shopping . &quot;
Mr. Bhaer smiled , as he glanced from the <unk> on one side , to the <unk> hide and <unk> <unk> on the other ; but he only said <unk> , -- &quot; You haf no umbrella .
May I go also , and take for you the bundles ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , thank you . &quot;
Jo &apos;s cheeks were as red as her ribbon , and she wondered what he thought of her ; but she didn &apos;t care , for in a minute she found herself walking away arm-in-arm with her Professor , feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy , that the world was all right again , and that one thoroughly happy woman was <unk> through the wet that day .
&quot; We thought you had gone , &quot; said Jo hastily , for she knew he was looking at her .
Her bonnet wasn &apos;t big enough to hide her face , and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly .
&quot; Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me ? &quot;
he asked so <unk> that she felt as if she had insulted him by the <unk> , and answered heartily , -- &quot; No , _ I _ didn &apos;t ; I knew you were busy about your own affairs , but we rather missed you , <unk> and mother especially . &quot;
&quot; And you ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m always glad to see you , sir . &quot;
In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm , Jo made it rather cool , and the <unk> little <unk> at the end seemed to <unk> the Professor , for his smile vanished , as he said gravely , -- &quot; I thank you , and come one time more before I go . &quot;
&quot; You _ are _ going , then ? &quot;
&quot; I haf no longer any business here ; it is done . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , I hope ? &quot;
said Jo , for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his .
&quot; I ought to think so , for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make my bread and gif my <unk> ? <unk> much help . &quot;
&quot; Tell me , please !
I like to know all about <unk> boys , &quot; said Jo eagerly .
&quot; That is so kind , I gladly tell you .
My friends find for me a place in a college , where I teach as at home , and earn enough to make the way smooth for Franz and Emil .
For this I should be grateful , should I not ? &quot;
&quot; Indeed you should .
How splendid it will be to have you doing what you like , and be able to see you often , and the boys ! &quot;
cried Jo , clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help <unk> .
&quot; Ah !
but we shall not meet often , I fear ; this place is at the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; So far away ! &quot;
and Jo left her skirts to their fate , as if it didn &apos;t matter now what became of her clothes or herself .
Mr. Bhaer could read several languages , but he had not learned to read women yet .
He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well , and was , therefore , much amazed by the <unk> of voice , face , and manner , which she showed him in <unk> <unk> that day , for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour .
When she met him she looked surprised , though it was impossible to help <unk> that she had come for that express purpose .
When he offered her his arm , she took it with a look that filled him with delight ; but when he asked if she missed him , she gave such a chilly , formal reply that despair fell upon him .
On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands : was the joy all for the boys ?
Then , on hearing his <unk> , she said , &quot; So far away ! &quot;
in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a <unk> of hope ; but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing , like one entirely absorbed in the matter , -- &quot; Here &apos;s the place for my errands ; will you come in ?
It won &apos;t take long . &quot;
Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping <unk> , and particularly wished to <unk> her escort with the <unk> and <unk> with which she would <unk> the business .
But , <unk> to the flutter she was in , everything went amiss ; she upset the <unk> of needles , forgot the <unk> was to be &quot; <unk> &quot; till it was cut off , gave the wrong change , and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon at the <unk> <unk> .
Mr. Bhaer stood by , watching her blush and blunder ; and , as he watched , his own bewilderment seemed to <unk> , for he was beginning to see that on some occasions women , like dreams , go by <unk> .
When they came out , he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect , and <unk> through the <unk> as if he rather enjoyed it , on the whole .
&quot; <unk> we not do a little what you call shopping for the babies , and haf a farewell feast to-night if I go for my last call at your so pleasant home ? &quot;
he asked , stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers .
&quot; What will we buy ? &quot;
said Jo , <unk> the latter part of his speech , and <unk> the mingled <unk> with an <unk> of delight as they went in .
&quot; May they haf <unk> and <unk> ? &quot;
asked Mr. Bhaer , with a paternal air .
&quot; They eat them when they can get them . &quot;
&quot; Do you care for nuts ? &quot;
&quot; Like a squirrel . &quot;
&quot; <unk> grapes ; yes , we shall surely drink to the <unk> in those ? &quot;
Jo frowned upon that piece of <unk> , and asked why he didn &apos;t buy a frail of <unk> , a <unk> of raisins , and a bag of <unk> , and done with it ?
<unk> Mr. Bhaer <unk> her purse , produced his own , and finished the <unk> by buying several <unk> of grapes , a pot of rosy <unk> , and a pretty jar of honey , to be regarded in the light of a <unk> .
Then , <unk> his pockets with the knobby bundles , and giving her the flowers to hold , he put up the old umbrella , and they travelled on again .
&quot; Miss Marsch , I haf a great favor to ask of you , &quot; began the Professor , after a <unk> promenade of half a <unk> .
&quot; Yes , sir ; &quot; and Jo &apos;s heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it .
&quot; I am bold to say it in spite of the rain , because so short a time remains to me . &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; &quot; and Jo nearly crushed the small <unk> with the sudden squeeze she gave it .
&quot; I wish to get a little dress for my Tina , and I am too stupid to go alone .
Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; &quot; and Jo felt as calm and cool , all of a sudden , as if she had <unk> into a <unk> .
&quot; Perhaps also a shawl for Tina &apos;s mother , she is so poor and sick , and the husband is such a care .
Yes , yes , a thick , warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll do it with pleasure , Mr. Bhaer .
I &apos;m going very fast and he &apos;s getting dearer every minute , &quot; added Jo to herself ; then , with a mental shake , she entered into the business with an energy which was pleasant to behold .
Mr. Bhaer left it all to her , so she chose a pretty gown for Tina , and then ordered out the <unk> .
The <unk> , being a married man , <unk> to take an interest in the couple , who appeared to be shopping for their family .
&quot; Your lady may prefer this ; it &apos;s a superior article , a most desirable color , quite <unk> and <unk> , &quot; he said , shaking out a comfortable gray shawl , and throwing it over Jo &apos;s shoulders .
&#91; Illustration : Does this suit you , Mr.
Bhaer ? &#93;
&quot; Does this suit you , Mr.
Bhaer ? &quot;
she asked , turning her back to him , and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face .
&quot; <unk> well ; we will haf it , &quot; answered the Professor , smiling to himself as he paid for it , while Jo continued to rummage the <unk> like a confirmed <unk> .
&quot; Now shall we go home ? &quot;
he asked , as if the words were very pleasant to him .
&quot; Yes ; it &apos;s late , and I &apos;m _ so _ tired . &quot;
Jo &apos;s voice was more pathetic than she knew ; for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out , the world grew muddy and miserable again , and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold , her head ached , and that her heart was <unk> than the former , <unk> of pain than the latter .
Mr. Bhaer was going away ; he only cared for her as a friend ; it was all a mistake , and the sooner it was over the better .
With this idea in her head , she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the <unk> flew out of the pot and were badly damaged .
&quot; This is not our <unk> , &quot; said the Professor , waving the loaded <unk> away , and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers .
&quot; I beg your pardon , I didn &apos;t see the name <unk> .
Never mind , I can walk .
I &apos;m used to <unk> in the mud , &quot; returned Jo , winking hard , because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes .
Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks , though she turned her head away ; the sight seemed to touch him very much , for , suddenly stooping down , he asked in a tone that meant a great deal , -- &quot; Heart &apos;s dearest , why do you cry ? &quot;
Now , if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she wasn &apos;t crying , had a cold in her head , or told any other feminine fib proper to the occasion ; instead of which that <unk> creature answered , with an irrepressible sob , -- &quot; Because you are going away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , <unk> Gott , that is _ so _ good ! &quot;
cried Mr. Bhaer , <unk> to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles .
&quot; Jo , I haf nothing but much love to gif you ; I came to see if you could care for it , and I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend .
Am I ?
Can you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz ? &quot;
he added , all in one breath .
&quot; Oh , yes ! &quot;
said Jo ; and he was quite satisfied , for she folded both hands over his arm , and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him , even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella , if he carried it .
It was certainly <unk> under <unk> , for , even if he had desired to do so , Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees , on account of the mud ; neither could he offer Jo his hand , except <unk> , for both were full ; much less could he indulge in tender <unk> in the open street , though he was near it : so the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her , with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little <unk> in the drops that sparkled on his beard .
If he had not loved Jo very much , I don &apos;t think he could have done it _ then _ , for she looked far from lovely , with her skirts in a <unk> state , her rubber boots <unk> to the ankle , and her bonnet a ruin .
Fortunately , Mr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living , and she found him more &quot; <unk> &quot; than ever , though his <unk> was quite <unk> with the little <unk> <unk> <unk> upon his shoulders ( for he held the umbrella all over Jo ) , and every finger of his gloves needed mending .
<unk> probably thought them a pair of harmless <unk> , for they entirely forgot to <unk> a &apos; <unk> , and strolled leisurely along , <unk> of <unk> dusk and fog .
Little they cared what anybody thought , for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life , the <unk> moment which <unk> youth on the old , beauty on the plain , wealth on the poor , and gives human hearts a <unk> of heaven .
The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom , and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss ; while Jo <unk> beside him , feeling as if her place had always been there , and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot .
Of course , she was the first to <unk> , I mean , for the <unk> remarks which followed her impetuous &quot; Oh , yes ! &quot;
were not of a <unk> or <unk> character .
&quot; Friedrich , why didn &apos;t you-- &quot; &quot; Ah , heaven , she <unk> me the name that no one speaks since Minna died ! &quot;
cried the Professor , pausing in a <unk> to regard her with grateful delight .
&quot; I always call you so to <unk> forgot ; but I won &apos;t , unless you like it . &quot;
&quot; Like it ?
it is more sweet to me than I can tell .
Say &apos; thou , &apos; also , and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine . &quot;
&quot; Isn &apos;t &apos; thou &apos; a little sentimental ? &quot;
asked Jo , privately thinking it a lovely <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ?
Yes .
Thank Gott , we Germans believe in sentiment , and keep ourselves young <unk> it .
Your English &apos; you &apos; is so cold , say &apos; thou , &apos; heart &apos;s dearest , it means so much to me , &quot; pleaded Mr. Bhaer , more like a romantic <unk> than a grave <unk> .
&quot; Well , then , why didn &apos;t thou tell me all this sooner ? &quot;
asked Jo <unk> .
&quot; Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart , and I so gladly will , because thou must take care of it <unk> .
See , then , my Jo , <unk> , the dear , funny little name ! --I had a wish to tell something the day I said good-by , in New York ; but I thought the handsome friend was <unk> to thee , and so I spoke not .
<unk> thou have said &apos; Yes , &apos; then , if I _ had _ spoken ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know ; I &apos;m afraid not , for I didn &apos;t have any heart just then . &quot;
&quot; Prut !
that I do not believe .
It was asleep till the fairy <unk> came through the wood , and waked it up .
Ah , well , &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> ist die <unk> ; &apos; but that I should not expect . &quot;
&quot; Yes , the first love _ is _ the best ; so be contented , for I never had another .
Teddy was only a boy , and soon got over his little fancy , &quot; said Jo , anxious to correct the Professor &apos;s mistake .
&quot; Good !
then I shall rest happy , and be sure that thou <unk> me all .
I haf waited so long , I am grown selfish , as thou <unk> find , <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I like that , &quot; cried Jo , delighted with her new name .
&quot; Now tell me what brought you , at last , just when I most wanted you ? &quot;
&quot; This ; &quot; and Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his <unk> .
Jo <unk> it , and looked much abashed , for it was one of her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry , which <unk> for her sending it an occasional attempt .
&quot; How could that bring you ? &quot;
she asked , wondering what he meant .
&quot; I found it by chance ; I knew it by the names and the <unk> , and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me .
Read and find him ; I will see that you go not in the wet . &quot;
Jo obeyed , and hastily <unk> through the lines which she had <unk> &quot; IN THE <unk> .
&quot; Four little chests all in a row , <unk> with dust , and worn by time , All <unk> and filled , long ago , By children now in their prime .
Four little keys hung side by side , With faded ribbons , brave and gay When fastened there , with childish pride , Long ago , on a rainy day .
Four little names , one on each lid , <unk> out by a boyish hand , And <unk> there <unk> hid <unk> of the happy band Once playing here , and pausing <unk> To hear the sweet refrain , That came and went on the roof <unk> , In the falling summer rain .
&quot; &apos; Meg &apos; on the first lid , smooth and fair .
I look in with loving eyes , For folded here , with well-known care , A <unk> gathering lies , The record of a peaceful life , -- <unk> to gentle child and girl , A bridal gown , lines to a wife , A tiny shoe , a baby curl .
No <unk> in this first chest remain , For all are carried away , In their old age , to join again In another small Meg &apos;s play .
Ah , happy mother !
well I know You hear , like a sweet refrain , <unk> ever soft and low In the falling summer rain .
&quot; &apos; Jo &apos; on the next lid , <unk> and worn , And within a <unk> store Of <unk> dolls , of <unk> torn , <unk> and <unk> that speak no more ; <unk> brought home from the fairy ground Only <unk> by youthful feet , <unk> of a future never found , <unk> of a past still sweet ; <unk> <unk> , stories wild , April letters , warm and cold , <unk> of a wilful child , <unk> of a woman early old ; A woman in a lonely home , Hearing , like a sad refrain , -- &apos; Be worthy love , and love will come , &apos; In the falling summer rain .
&quot; My Beth !
the dust is always swept From the lid that bears your name , As if by loving eyes that wept , By careful hands that often came .
<unk> <unk> for us one saint , Ever less human than divine , And still we lay , with tender <unk> , <unk> in this household <unk> The silver bell , so seldom rung , The little cap which last she wore , The fair , dead <unk> that hung By angels borne above her door ; The songs she sang , without lament , In her <unk> of pain , <unk> are they sweetly <unk> With the falling summer rain .
&quot; Upon the last lid &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> now both fair and <unk> A gallant knight bears on his shield , &apos; Amy , &apos; in letters gold and blue .
<unk> lie <unk> that bound her hair , <unk> that have danced their last , <unk> flowers laid by with care , <unk> whose airy <unk> are past ; <unk> <unk> , all ardent <unk> , <unk> that have borne their part In girlish hopes and fears and <unk> , -- The record of a maiden heart Now learning fairer , <unk> <unk> , Hearing , like a blithe refrain , The silver sound of bridal bells In the falling summer rain .
&quot; Four little chests all in a row , <unk> with dust , and worn by time , Four women , taught by <unk> and woe To love and labor in their prime .
Four sisters , parted for an hour , None lost , one only gone before , <unk> by love &apos;s immortal power , <unk> and dearest <unk> .
Oh , when these hidden stores of ours <unk> open to the Father &apos;s sight , May they be rich in golden hours , <unk> that show fairer for the light , <unk> whose brave music long shall ring , Like a <unk> strain , <unk> that shall gladly <unk> and sing In the long sunshine after rain .
&quot; <unk> M. &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very bad poetry , but I felt it when I wrote it , one day when I was very lonely , and had a good cry on a rag-bag .
I never thought it would go where it could tell tales , &quot; said Jo , tearing up the verses the Professor had <unk> so long .
&quot; Let it go , it has done its duty , and I will haf a fresh one when I read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets , &quot; said Mr. Bhaer , with a smile , as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind .
&quot; Yes , &quot; he added earnestly , &quot; I read that , and I think to myself , &apos; She has a sorrow , she is lonely , she would find comfort in true love .
I haf a heart full , full for her ; shall I not go and say , &apos; If this is not too poor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive , take it in Gott &apos;s name ? &apos; &quot;
&quot; And so you came to find that it was not too poor , but the one precious thing I needed , &quot; whispered Jo .
&quot; I had no courage to think that at first , heavenly kind as was your welcome to me .
But soon I began to hope , and then I said , &apos; I will haf her if I die for it , &apos; and so I will ! &quot;
cried Mr. Bhaer , with a <unk> nod , as if the walls of <unk> <unk> round them were <unk> which he was to <unk> or <unk> knock down .
Jo thought that was splendid , and resolved to be worthy of her knight , though he did not come prancing on a <unk> in gorgeous array .
&quot; What made you stay away so long ? &quot;
she asked presently , finding it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that she could not keep silent .
&quot; It was not easy , but I could not find the heart to take you from that so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to give you , after much time , perhaps , and hard work .
How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow , who has no fortune but a little learning ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m glad you _ are _ poor ; I couldn &apos;t bear a rich husband , &quot; said Jo decidedly , adding , in a <unk> tone , &quot; Don &apos;t fear poverty ; I &apos;ve known it long enough to lose my dread , and be happy working for those I love ; and don &apos;t call yourself old , <unk> is the prime of life .
I couldn &apos;t help loving you if you were seventy ! &quot;
The Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief , if he could have got at it ; as he couldn &apos;t , Jo wiped his eyes for him , and said , laughing , as she took away a bundle or two , -- &quot; I may be strong-minded , but no one can say I &apos;m out of my <unk> now , for woman &apos;s special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing burdens .
I &apos;m to carry my share , Friedrich , and help to earn the home .
Make up your mind to that , or I &apos;ll never go , &quot; she added <unk> , as he tried to <unk> his load .
&quot; We shall see .
<unk> you patience to wait a long time , Jo ?
I must go away and do my work alone .
I must help my boys first , because , even for you , I may not break my word to Minna .
Can you <unk> that , and be happy while we hope and wait ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I know I can ; for we love one another , and that makes all the rest easy to bear .
I have my duty , also , and my work .
I couldn &apos;t enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you , so there &apos;s no need of hurry or impatience .
You can do your part out <unk> , I can do mine here , and both be happy hoping for the best , and leaving the future to be as God wills . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
thou <unk> me such hope and courage , and I haf nothing to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands , &quot; cried the Professor , quite overcome .
&#91; Illustration : Under the umbrella &#93; Jo never , never would learn to be proper ; for when he said that as they stood upon the steps , she just put both hands into his , whispering tenderly , &quot; Not empty now ; &quot; and , stooping down , kissed her Friedrich under the umbrella .
It was dreadful , but she would have done it if the flock of <unk> <unk> on the hedge had been human beings , for she was very far gone indeed , and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness .
Though it came in such a very simple <unk> , that was the crowning moment of both their lives , when , turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them , with a glad &quot; Welcome home ! &quot;
Jo led her lover in , and shut the door .
&#91; Illustration : Tail-piece &#93; &#91; Illustration : <unk> time &#93; <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited , hoped and loved , met occasionally , and wrote such <unk> letters that the rise in the price of paper was <unk> for , Laurie said .
The second year began rather soberly , for their <unk> did not brighten , and Aunt March died suddenly .
But when their first sorrow was over , --for they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue , <unk> found they had cause for rejoicing , for she had left Plumfield to Jo , which made all sorts of joyful things possible .
&quot; It &apos;s a fine old place , and will bring a handsome sum ; for of course you intend to sell it , &quot; said Laurie , as they were all talking the matter over , some weeks later .
&quot; No , I don &apos;t , &quot; was Jo &apos;s decided answer , as she petted the fat poodle , whom she had <unk> , out of respect to his former mistress .
&quot; You don &apos;t mean to live there ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I do . &quot;
&quot; But , my dear girl , it &apos;s an immense house , and will take a power of money to keep it in order .
The garden and orchard alone need two or three men , and <unk> isn &apos;t in Bhaer &apos;s line , I take it . &quot;
&quot; He &apos;ll try his hand at it there , if I propose it . &quot;
&quot; And you expect to live on the produce of the place ?
Well , that sounds <unk> , but you &apos;ll find it desperate hard work . &quot;
&quot; The crop we are going to <unk> is a profitable one ; &quot; and Jo laughed .
&quot; Of what is this fine crop to <unk> , ma &apos;am ? &quot;
&quot; Boys .
I want to open a school for little lads , --a good , happy , homelike school , with me to take care of them , and Fritz to teach them . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s a truly <unk> plan for you !
Isn &apos;t that just like her ? &quot;
cried Laurie , appealing to the family , who looked as much surprised as he .
&quot; I like it , &quot; said Mrs. March decidedly .
&quot; So do I , &quot; added her husband , who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the <unk> method of education on <unk> youth .
&quot; It will be an immense care for Jo , &quot; said Meg , stroking the head of her one all-absorbing son .
&quot; Jo can do it , and be happy in it .
It &apos;s a splendid idea .
Tell us all about it , &quot; cried Mr. Laurence , who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand , but knew that they would refuse his help .
&quot; I knew you &apos;d stand by me , sir .
Amy does <unk> see it in her eyes , though she prudently <unk> to turn it over in her mind before she speaks .
Now , my dear people , &quot; continued Jo earnestly , &quot; just understand that this isn &apos;t a new idea of mine , but a <unk> plan .
Before my Fritz came , I used to think how , when I &apos;d made my fortune , and no one needed me at home , I &apos;d hire a big house , and pick up some poor , forlorn little lads , who hadn &apos;t any mothers , and take care of them , and make life jolly for them before it was too late .
I see so many going to ruin , for want of help at the right minute ; I love so to do anything for them ; I seem to feel their wants , and sympathize with their troubles , and , oh , I should _ so _ like to be a mother to them ! &quot;
Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo , who took it , smiling , with tears in her eyes , and went on in the old enthusiastic way , which they had not seen for a long while .
&quot; I told my plan to Fritz once , and he said it was just what he would like , and agreed to try it when we got rich .
Bless his dear heart , he &apos;s been doing it all his life , <unk> poor boys , I mean , not getting rich ; that he &apos;ll never be ; money doesn &apos;t stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any .
But now , thanks to my good old aunt , who loved me better than I ever deserved , _ I &apos;m _ rich , at least I feel so , and we can live at Plumfield perfectly well , if we have a <unk> school .
It &apos;s just the place for boys , the house is big , and the furniture strong and plain .
There &apos;s plenty of room for <unk> inside , and splendid grounds outside .
They could help in the garden and orchard : such work is healthy , isn &apos;t it , sir ?
Then Fritz can train and teach in his own way , and father will help him .
I can feed and nurse and pet and scold them ; and mother will be my <unk> .
I &apos;ve always longed for lots of boys , and never had enough ; now I can fill the house full , and revel in the little dears to my heart &apos;s content .
<unk> what luxury , <unk> my own , and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me ! &quot;
As Jo waved her hands , and gave a sigh of rapture , the family went off into a <unk> of merriment , and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought he &apos;d have an <unk> fit .
&quot; I don &apos;t see anything funny , &quot; she said gravely , when she could be heard .
&quot; Nothing could be more natural or proper than for my Professor to open a school , and for me to prefer to <unk> on my own <unk> . &quot;
&quot; She is putting on airs already , &quot; said Laurie , who regarded the idea in the light of a capital joke .
&quot; But may I inquire how you intend to support the establishment ?
If all the pupils are little <unk> , I &apos;m afraid your crop won &apos;t be profitable in a worldly sense , Mrs.
Bhaer . &quot;
&quot; Now don &apos;t be a <unk> , Teddy .
Of course I shall have rich pupils , also , <unk> begin with such altogether ; then , when I &apos;ve got a start , I can take a <unk> or two , just for a relish .
Rich people &apos;s children often need care and comfort , as well as poor .
I &apos;ve seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants , or <unk> ones pushed forward , when it &apos;s real <unk> .
Some are naughty through <unk> or neglect , and some lose their mothers .
Besides , the best have to get through the <unk> age , and that &apos;s the very time they need most patience and kindness .
People laugh at them , and <unk> them about , try to keep them out of sight , and expect them to turn , all at once , from pretty children into fine young men .
They don &apos;t complain much , <unk> little souls , --but they feel it .
I &apos;ve been through something of it , and I know all about it .
I &apos;ve a special interest in such young bears , and like to show them that I see the warm , honest , <unk> boys &apos; hearts , in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsy-turvy heads .
I &apos;ve had experience , too , for haven &apos;t I brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll <unk> that you tried to do it , &quot; said Laurie , with a grateful look .
&quot; And I &apos;ve succeeded beyond my hopes ; for here you are , a steady , sensible business man , doing heaps of good with your money , and laying up the blessings of the poor , instead of dollars .
But you are not merely a business man : you love good and beautiful things , enjoy them yourself , and let others go halves , as you always did in the old times .
I _ am _ proud of you , Teddy , for you get better every year , and every one feels it , though you won &apos;t let them say so .
Yes , and when I have my flock , I &apos;ll just point to you , and say , &apos; There &apos;s your model , my lads . &apos; &quot;
Poor Laurie didn &apos;t know where to look ; for , man though he was , something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him .
&quot; I say , Jo , that &apos;s rather too much , &quot; he began , just in his old boyish way .
&quot; You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for , except by doing my best not to disappoint you .
You have rather cast me off lately , Jo , but I &apos;ve had the best of help , nevertheless ; so , if I &apos;ve got on at all , you may thank these two for it ; &quot; and he laid one hand gently on his grandfather &apos;s white head , the other on Amy &apos;s golden one , for the three were never far apart .
&quot; I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world ! &quot;
burst out Jo , who was in an unusually uplifted frame of mind just then .
&quot; When I have one of my own , I hope it will be as happy as the three I know and love the best .
If John and my Fritz were only here , it would be quite a little heaven on earth , &quot; she added more quietly .
And that night , when she went to her room , after a blissful evening of family <unk> , hopes , and plans , her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own , and thinking tender thoughts of Beth .
It was a very astonishing year altogether , for things seemed to happen in an unusually <unk> and delightful manner .
<unk> before she knew where she was , Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield .
Then a family of six or seven boys <unk> up like <unk> , and flourished <unk> , poor boys as well as rich ; for Mr. Laurence was continually finding some touching case of <unk> , and begging the <unk> to take pity on the child , and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support .
In this way the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo , and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted .
Of course it was <unk> work at first , and Jo made queer mistakes ; but the wise Professor <unk> her safely into <unk> <unk> , and the most <unk> <unk> was conquered in the end .
How Jo did enjoy her &quot; wilderness of boys , &quot; and how poor , dear Aunt March would have <unk> had she been there to see the sacred <unk> of prim , <unk> Plumfield <unk> with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> !
There was a sort of <unk> justice about it , after all , for the old lady had been the <unk> of the boys for miles round ; and now the <unk> <unk> freely on forbidden <unk> , <unk> up the <unk> with <unk> boots <unk> , and played cricket in the big field where the <unk> &quot; <unk> with a crumpled <unk> &quot; used to invite rash <unk> to come and be tossed .
It became a sort of boys &apos; paradise , and Laurie suggested that it should be called the &quot; <unk> , &quot; as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its <unk> .
It never was a fashionable school , and the Professor did not lay up a fortune ; but it _ was _ just what Jo intended it to be , -- &quot; a happy , homelike place for boys , who needed teaching , care , and kindness . &quot;
Every room in the big house was soon full ; every little plot in the garden soon had its owner ; a regular <unk> appeared in <unk> and shed , for pet <unk> were allowed ; and , three times a day , Jo smiled at her Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with <unk> of happy young faces , which all turned to her with affectionate eyes , confiding words , and grateful hearts , full of love for &quot; Mother Bhaer . &quot;
She had boys enough now , and did not tire of them , though they were not angels , by any means , and some of them caused both Professor and <unk> much trouble and anxiety .
But her faith in the good spot which <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , <unk> , most <unk> little <unk> gave her patience , skill , and , in time , success ; for no mortal boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as <unk> as the sun , and Mother Bhaer <unk> him seventy times seven .
Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads ; their penitent <unk> and whispers after <unk> ; their droll or touching little confidences ; their pleasant <unk> , hopes , and plans ; even their <unk> , for they only <unk> them to her all the more .
There were slow boys and bashful boys ; feeble boys and riotous boys ; boys that <unk> and boys that <unk> ; one or two lame ones ; and a merry little <unk> , who could not be taken in elsewhere , but who was welcome to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; though some people <unk> that his admission would ruin the school .
Yes ; Jo was a very happy woman there , in spite of hard work , much anxiety , and a perpetual racket .
She enjoyed it heartily , and found the applause of her boys more <unk> than any praise of the world ; for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic <unk> and <unk> .
As the years went on , two little lads of her own came to increase her happiness , <unk> , named for grandpa , and Teddy , a <unk> baby , who seemed to have <unk> his papa &apos;s sunshiny temper as well as his mother &apos;s lively spirit .
How they ever grew up alive in that <unk> of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts ; but they flourished like <unk> in spring , and their rough <unk> loved and served them well .
There were a great many <unk> at Plumfield , and one of the most delightful was the <unk> <unk> ; for then the Marches , Laurences , <unk> , and <unk> turned out in full force , and made a day of it .
<unk> years after Jo &apos;s wedding , one of these <unk> <unk> occurred , --a mellow October day , when the air was full of an <unk> <unk> which made the spirits rise , and the blood dance <unk> in the <unk> .
The old orchard wore its holiday <unk> ; <unk> and <unk> <unk> the mossy walls ; <unk> skipped briskly in the <unk> grass , and <unk> chirped like fairy <unk> at a feast ; <unk> were busy with their small <unk> ; birds <unk> their <unk> from the <unk> in the <unk> ; and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake .
Everybody was there ; everybody laughed and sang , climbed up and tumbled down ; everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it ; and every one gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world .
Mr. March strolled <unk> about , quoting <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> to Mr. Laurence , while <unk> &quot; The gentle <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The Professor <unk> up and down the green <unk> like a stout <unk> knight , with a <unk> for a <unk> , leading on the boys , who made a <unk> and ladder company of themselves , and performed <unk> in the way of ground and <unk> tumbling .
Laurie devoted himself to the little ones , rode his small daughter in a <unk> , took Daisy up among the birds &apos; <unk> , and kept <unk> <unk> from breaking his neck .
Mrs. March and Meg sat among the <unk> piles like a pair of <unk> , sorting the contributions that kept <unk> in ; while Amy , with a beautiful motherly expression in her face , sketched the various <unk> , and watched over one pale lad , who sat <unk> her with his little crutch beside him .
Jo was in her element that day , and rushed about , with her gown <unk> up , her hat anywhere but on her head , and her baby tucked under her arm , ready for any lively <unk> which might turn up .
Little Teddy bore a charmed life , for nothing ever happened to him , and Jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad , <unk> off on the back of another , or supplied with sour <unk> by his <unk> papa , who labored under the <unk> delusion that babies could <unk> anything , from pickled <unk> to buttons , <unk> , and their own small shoes .
She knew that little <unk> would turn up again in time , safe and rosy , dirty and serene , and she always received him back with a hearty welcome , for Jo loved her babies tenderly .
&#91; Illustration : Teddy bore a charmed life &#93; At four o &apos;clock a lull took place , and baskets remained empty , while the <unk> rested , and compared <unk> and <unk> .
Then Jo and Meg , with a <unk> of the bigger boys , set forth the supper on the grass , for an <unk> tea was always the crowning joy of the day .
The land <unk> <unk> with milk and honey on such occasions , for the lads were not <unk> to sit at table , but allowed to partake of refreshment as they liked , <unk> being the <unk> best beloved by the boyish soul .
They <unk> themselves of the <unk> <unk> to the fullest extent , for some tried the pleasing experiment of <unk> milk while standing on their heads , others lent a charm to <unk> by eating <unk> in the <unk> of the game , <unk> were <unk> <unk> over the field , and <unk> <unk> in the trees like a new style of bird .
The little girls had a private <unk> , and <unk> <unk> among the <unk> at his own sweet will .
When no one could eat any more , the Professor proposed the first regular toast , which was always drunk at such times , -- &quot; Aunt March , God bless her ! &quot;
A toast heartily given by the good man , who never forgot how much he <unk> her , and quietly drunk by the boys , who had been taught to keep her memory green .
&quot; Now , grandma &apos;s <unk> birthday !
Long life to her , with three times three ! &quot;
That was given with a will , as you may well believe ; and the cheering once begun , it was hard to stop it .
Everybody &apos;s health was proposed , from Mr. Laurence , who was considered their special <unk> , to the astonished <unk> , who had strayed from its proper <unk> in search of its young master .
Demi , as the oldest <unk> , then presented the queen of the day with various gifts , so <unk> that they were <unk> to the festive scene in a <unk> .
<unk> presents , some of them , but what would have been <unk> to other eyes were ornaments to grandma &apos;s , --for the children &apos;s gifts were all their own .
Every <unk> Daisy &apos;s patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than <unk> to Mrs. March ; Demi &apos;s <unk> was a miracle of <unk> skill , though the cover wouldn &apos;t shut ; <unk> &apos;s <unk> had a <unk> in its uneven legs , that she declared was very soothing ; and no page of the <unk> book Amy &apos;s child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared , in <unk> <unk> , the words , -- &quot; To dear <unk> , from her little Beth . &quot;
During this ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared ; and , when Mrs. March had tried to thank her children , and broken down , while Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore , the Professor suddenly began to sing .
Then , from above him , voice after voice took up the words , and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen <unk> , as the boys sung , with all their hearts , the little song Jo had written , Laurie set to music , and the Professor <unk> his lads to give with the best effect .
This was something altogether new , and it proved a grand success ; for Mrs. March couldn &apos;t get over her surprise , and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the <unk> birds , from tall Franz and Emil to the little <unk> , who had the sweetest voice of all .
After this , the boys <unk> for a final lark , leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival tree .
&#91; Illustration : &quot; Leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival tree . &quot;
--Page <unk> &#93; &quot; I don &apos;t think I ever ought to call myself &apos; <unk> Jo &apos; again , when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified , &quot; said Mrs. Bhaer , taking Teddy &apos;s little fist out of the <unk> , in which he was <unk> <unk> .
&quot; And yet your life is very different from the one you <unk> so long ago .
Do you remember our <unk> in the air ? &quot;
asked Amy , smiling as she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys .
&quot; Dear fellows !
It does my heart good to see them forget business , and frolic for a day , &quot; answered Jo , who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind .
&quot; Yes , I remember ; but the life I wanted then seems selfish , lonely , and cold to me now .
I haven &apos;t given up the hope that I may write a good book yet , but I can wait , and I &apos;m sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as these ; &quot; and Jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father , leaning on the Professor &apos;s arm , as they walked to and fro in the sunshine , deep in one of the conversations which both enjoyed so much , and then to her mother , sitting <unk> among her daughters , with their children in her lap and at her feet , as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them .
&quot; My castle was the most nearly realized of all .
I asked for splendid things , to be sure , but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied , if I had a little home , and John , and some dear children like these .
I &apos;ve got them all , thank God , and am the happiest woman in the world ; &quot; and Meg laid her hand on her tall boy &apos;s head , with a face full of tender and <unk> content .
&quot; My castle is very different from what I planned , but I would not <unk> it , though , like Jo , I don &apos;t <unk> all my artistic hopes , or <unk> myself to helping others <unk> their dreams of beauty .
I &apos;ve begun to model a figure of baby , and Laurie says it is the best thing I &apos;ve ever done .
I think so myself , and mean to do it in marble , so that , whatever happens , I may at least keep the <unk> of my little angel . &quot;
As Amy spoke , a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the <unk> child in her arms ; for her one <unk> daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy &apos;s sunshine .
This cross was doing much for both father and mother , for one love and sorrow bound them closely together .
Amy &apos;s nature was growing sweeter , <unk> , and more tender ; Laurie was growing more serious , strong , and firm ; and both were learning that beauty , youth , good fortune , even love itself , cannot keep care and pain , loss and sorrow , from the most blest ; <unk> &quot; <unk> each life some rain must fall , Some days must be dark and sad and dreary . &quot;
&quot; She is growing better , I am sure of it , my dear .
Don &apos;t <unk> , but hope and keep happy , &quot; said Mrs. March , as tender-hearted Daisy stooped from her knee , to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin &apos;s pale one .
&quot; I never ought to , while I have you to cheer me up , Marmee , and Laurie to take more than half of every burden , &quot; replied Amy warmly .
&quot; He never lets me see his anxiety , but is so sweet and patient with me , so devoted to Beth , and such a stay and comfort to me always , that I can &apos;t love him enough .
So , in spite of my one cross , I can say with Meg , &apos; Thank God , I &apos;m a happy woman . &apos; &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s no need for me to say it , for every one can see that I &apos;m far happier than I deserve , &quot; added Jo , glancing from her good husband to her <unk> children , tumbling on the grass beside her .
&quot; Fritz is getting gray and stout ; I &apos;m growing as thin as a shadow , and am thirty ; we never shall be rich , and Plumfield may burn up any night , for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs _ will _ smoke <unk> <unk> under the <unk> , though he &apos;s set himself <unk> three times already .
But in spite of these unromantic facts , I have nothing to complain of , and never was so jolly in my life .
Excuse the remark , but living among boys , I can &apos;t help using their <unk> now and then . &quot;
&quot; Yes , Jo , I think your <unk> will be a good one , &quot; began Mrs. March , <unk> away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of countenance .
&quot; Not half so good as yours , mother .
Here it is , and we never can thank you enough for the patient <unk> and <unk> you have done , &quot; cried Jo , with the loving <unk> which she never could <unk> .
&quot; I hope there will be more <unk> and <unk> <unk> every year , &quot; said Amy softly .
&quot; A large <unk> , but I know there &apos;s room in your heart for it , Marmee dear , &quot; added Meg &apos;s tender voice .
<unk> to the heart , Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms , as if to gather children and <unk> to herself , and say , with face and voice full of motherly love , gratitude , and humility , -- &quot; O , my girls , however long you may live , I never can wish you a greater happiness than this ! &quot;
