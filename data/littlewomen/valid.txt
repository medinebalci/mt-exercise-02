<unk> <unk> .
&quot; Christmas won &apos;t be Christmas without any presents , &quot; <unk> Jo , lying on the rug .
&quot; It &apos;s so dreadful to be poor ! &quot;
sighed Meg , looking down at her old dress .
&quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things , and other girls nothing at all , &quot; added little Amy , with an injured sniff .
&quot; We &apos;ve got father and mother and each other , &quot; said Beth <unk> , from her corner .
The four young faces on which the <unk> shone brightened at the cheerful words , but darkened again as Jo said sadly , -- &quot; We haven &apos;t got father , and shall not have him for a long time . &quot;
She didn &apos;t say &quot; perhaps never , &quot; but each silently added it , thinking of father far away , where the fighting was .
Nobody spoke for a minute ; then Meg said in an altered tone , -- &quot; You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one ; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure , when our men are suffering so in the army .
We can &apos;t do much , but we can make our little sacrifices , and ought to do it gladly .
But I am afraid I don &apos;t ; &quot; and Meg shook her head , as she thought <unk> of all the pretty things she wanted .
&quot; But I don &apos;t think the little we should spend would do any good .
We &apos;ve each got a dollar , and the army wouldn &apos;t be much helped by our giving that .
I agree not to expect anything from mother or you , but I do want to buy <unk> and <unk> for myself ; I &apos;ve wanted it _ so _ long , &quot; said Jo , who was a <unk> .
&quot; I planned to spend mine in new music , &quot; said Beth , with a little sigh , which no one heard but the <unk> and <unk> .
&quot; I shall get a nice box of <unk> &apos;s <unk> ; I really need them , &quot; said Amy decidedly .
&quot; Mother didn &apos;t say anything about our money , and she won &apos;t wish us to give up everything .
Let &apos;s each buy what we want , and have a little fun ; I &apos;m sure we work hard enough to earn it , &quot; cried Jo , examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner .
&quot; I know _ I _ do , <unk> those <unk> children nearly all day , when I &apos;m longing to enjoy myself at home , &quot; began Meg , in the complaining tone again .
&quot; You don &apos;t have half such a hard time as I do , &quot; said Jo .
&quot; How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous , fussy old lady , who keeps you trotting , is never satisfied , and worries you till you &apos;re ready to fly out of the window or cry ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s naughty to fret ; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world .
It makes me cross ; and my hands get so stiff , I can &apos;t practise well at all ; &quot; and Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time .
&quot; I don &apos;t believe any of you suffer as I do , &quot; cried Amy ; &quot; for you don &apos;t have to go to school with impertinent girls , who plague you if you don &apos;t know your lessons , and laugh at your dresses , and <unk> your father if he isn &apos;t rich , and insult you when your nose isn &apos;t nice . &quot;
&quot; If you mean _ <unk> _ , I &apos;d say so , and not talk about _ <unk> _ , as if papa was a <unk> , &quot; advised Jo , laughing .
&quot; I know what I mean , and you needn &apos;t be _ <unk> _ about it .
It &apos;s proper to use good words , and improve your _ <unk> _ , &quot; returned Amy , with dignity .
&quot; Don &apos;t peck at one another , children .
Don &apos;t you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little , Jo ?
Dear me !
how happy and good we &apos;d be , if we had no worries ! &quot;
said Meg , who could remember better times .
&quot; You said the other day , you thought we were a deal happier than the King children , for they were fighting and fretting all the time , in spite of their money . &quot;
&quot; So I did , Beth .
Well , I think we are ; for , though we do have to work , we make fun for ourselves , and are a pretty jolly set , as Jo would say . &quot;
&quot; Jo does use such slang words ! &quot;
observed Amy , with a <unk> look at the long figure stretched on the rug .
Jo immediately sat up , put her hands in her pockets , and began to whistle .
&quot; Don &apos;t , Jo ; it &apos;s so boyish ! &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s why I do it . &quot;
&quot; I <unk> rude , <unk> girls ! &quot;
&quot; I hate affected , <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
&quot; &apos; <unk> in their little <unk> agree , &apos; &quot; sang Beth , the <unk> , with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh , and the &quot; pecking &quot; ended for that time .
&quot; Really , girls , you are both to be <unk> , &quot; said Meg , beginning to lecture in her <unk> fashion .
&quot; You are old enough to leave off boyish <unk> , and to behave better , Josephine .
It didn &apos;t matter so much when you were a little girl ; but now you are so tall , and turn up your hair , you should remember that you are a young lady . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not !
and if turning up my hair makes me one , I &apos;ll wear it in two <unk> till I &apos;m twenty , &quot; cried Jo , pulling off her <unk> , and shaking down a chestnut mane .
&quot; I hate to think I &apos;ve got to grow up , and be Miss March , and wear long gowns , and look as prim as a <unk> !
It &apos;s bad enough to be a girl , <unk> , when I like boys &apos; games and work and manners !
I can &apos;t get over my disappointment in not being a boy ; and it &apos;s worse than ever now , for I &apos;m dying to go and fight with papa , and I can only stay at home and knit , like a <unk> old woman ! &quot;
And Jo shook the blue <unk> till the needles <unk> like <unk> , and her ball <unk> across the room .
&quot; Poor Jo !
It &apos;s too bad , but it can &apos;t be helped ; so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish , and playing brother to us girls , &quot; said Beth , stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that all the <unk> and <unk> in the world could not make <unk> in its touch .
&quot; As for you , Amy , &quot; continued Meg , &quot; you are altogether too particular and prim .
Your airs are funny now ; but you &apos;ll grow up an affected little goose , if you don &apos;t take care .
I like your nice manners and <unk> ways of speaking , when you don &apos;t try to be elegant ; but your absurd words are as bad as Jo &apos;s slang . &quot;
&quot; If Jo is a <unk> and Amy a goose , what am I , please ? &quot;
asked Beth , ready to share the lecture .
&quot; You &apos;re a dear , and nothing else , &quot; answered Meg warmly ; and no one <unk> her , for the &quot; <unk> &quot; was the pet of the family .
As young readers like to know &quot; how people look , &quot; we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters , who sat knitting away in the twilight , while the <unk> snow fell quietly without , and the fire <unk> cheerfully within .
It was a comfortable old room , though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain ; for a good picture or two hung on the walls , books filled the <unk> , <unk> and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows , and a pleasant atmosphere of <unk> pervaded it .
Margaret , the eldest of the four , was sixteen , and very pretty , being plump and fair , with large eyes , plenty of soft , brown hair , a sweet mouth , and white hands , of which she was rather vain .
<unk> Jo was very tall , thin , and brown , and reminded one of a colt ; for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs , which were very much in her way .
She had a decided mouth , a comical nose , and sharp , gray eyes , which appeared to see everything , and were by turns fierce , funny , or thoughtful .
Her long , thick hair was her one beauty ; but it was usually bundled into a <unk> , to be out of her way .
<unk> shoulders had Jo , big hands and feet , a fly-away look to her clothes , and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly <unk> up into a woman , and didn &apos;t like it .
<unk> Beth , as every one called <unk> a rosy , <unk> , bright-eyed girl of <unk> , with a shy manner , a timid voice , and a peaceful expression , which was seldom disturbed .
Her father called her &quot; Little <unk> , &quot; and the name suited her excellently ; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own , only <unk> out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved .
Amy , though the <unk> , was a most important person , <unk> her own opinion at least .
A regular <unk> , with blue eyes , and yellow hair , <unk> on her shoulders , pale and slender , and always carrying herself like a young lady <unk> of her manners .
What the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out .
The clock struck six ; and , having swept up the hearth , Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm .
Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls ; for mother was coming , and every one brightened to welcome her .
Meg stopped <unk> , and lighted the lamp , Amy got out of the easy-chair without being asked , and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze .
&#91; Illustration : Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm &#93; &quot; They are quite worn out ; Marmee must have a new pair . &quot;
&quot; I thought I &apos;d get her some with my dollar , &quot; said Beth .
&quot; No , I shall ! &quot;
cried Amy .
&quot; I &apos;m the oldest , &quot; began Meg , but Jo cut in with a <unk> &quot; I &apos;m the man of the family now papa is away , and _ I _ shall provide the slippers , for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you what we &apos;ll do , &quot; said Beth ; &quot; let &apos;s each get her something for Christmas , and not get anything for ourselves . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s like you , dear !
What will we get ? &quot;
exclaimed Jo .
Every one thought soberly for a minute ; then Meg announced , as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands , &quot; I shall give her a nice pair of gloves . &quot;
&quot; <unk> shoes , best to be had , &quot; cried Jo .
&quot; Some handkerchiefs , all hemmed , &quot; said Beth .
&quot; I &apos;ll get a little bottle of cologne ; she likes it , and it won &apos;t cost much , so I &apos;ll have some left to buy my pencils , &quot; added Amy .
&quot; How will we give the things ? &quot;
asked Meg .
&quot; Put them on the table , and bring her in and see her open the bundles .
Don &apos;t you remember how we used to do on our <unk> ? &quot;
answered Jo .
&#91; Illustration : I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big chair &#93; &quot; I used to be _ so _ frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big chair with the <unk> on , and see you all come marching round to give the presents , with a kiss .
I liked the things and the kisses , but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles , &quot; said Beth , who was <unk> her face and the bread for tea , at the same time .
&quot; Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves , and then surprise her .
We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon , Meg ; there is so much to do about the play for Christmas night , &quot; said Jo , marching up and down , with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air .
&quot; I don &apos;t mean to act any more after this time ; I &apos;m getting too old for such things , &quot; observed Meg , who was as much a child as ever about &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
&quot; You won &apos;t stop , I know , as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down , and wear <unk> <unk> .
You are the best <unk> we &apos;ve got , and there &apos;ll be an end of everything if you <unk> the <unk> , &quot; said Jo .
&quot; We ought to <unk> to-night .
Come here , Amy , and do the fainting scene , for you are as stiff as a <unk> in that . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t help it ; I never saw any one faint , and I don &apos;t choose to make myself all black and blue , tumbling flat as you do .
If I can go down easily , I &apos;ll drop ; if I can &apos;t , I shall fall into a chair and be graceful ; I don &apos;t care if Hugo does come at me with a <unk> , &quot; returned Amy , who was not gifted with dramatic power , but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out <unk> by the villain of the piece .
&#91; Illustration : Do it this way , clasp your hands so &#93; &quot; Do it this way ; clasp your hands so , and <unk> across the room , crying <unk> , &apos; Roderigo !
save me !
save me ! &apos; &quot;
and away went Jo , with a melodramatic <unk> which was truly thrilling .
Amy followed , but she poked her hands out <unk> before her , and <unk> herself along as if she went by machinery ; and her &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish .
Jo gave a despairing groan , and Meg laughed outright , while Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun , with interest .
&quot; It &apos;s no use !
Do the best you can when the time comes , and if the audience laugh , don &apos;t blame me .
Come on , Meg . &quot;
Then things went smoothly , for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break ; Hagar , the witch , <unk> an awful <unk> over her <unk> of simmering <unk> , with <unk> effect ; Roderigo <unk> his chains <unk> manfully , and Hugo died in <unk> of remorse and <unk> , with a wild &quot; Ha !
ha ! &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s the best we &apos;ve had yet , &quot; said Meg , as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows .
&quot; I don &apos;t see how you can write and act such splendid things , Jo .
You &apos;re a regular Shakespeare ! &quot;
exclaimed Beth , who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things .
&quot; Not quite , &quot; replied Jo modestly .
&quot; I do think &apos; The <unk> &apos;s <unk> , an <unk> <unk> , &apos; is rather a nice thing ; but I &apos;d like to try <unk> , if we only had a <unk> for <unk> .
I always wanted to do the <unk> part .
<unk> that a <unk> that I see before me ? &apos; &quot;
muttered Jo , rolling her eyes and <unk> at the air , as she had seen a famous <unk> do .
&quot; No , it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , with mother &apos;s shoe on it instead of the bread .
Beth &apos;s <unk> ! &quot;
cried Meg , and the <unk> ended in a general burst of laughter .
&quot; Glad to find you so merry , my girls , &quot; said a cheery voice at the door , and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall , motherly lady , with a &quot; <unk> &quot; look about her which was truly delightful .
She was not <unk> dressed , but a <unk> woman , and the girls thought the gray cloak and <unk> bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world .
&quot; Well , <unk> , how have you got on to-day ?
There was so much to do , getting the boxes ready to go to-morrow , that I didn &apos;t come home to dinner .
Has any one called , Beth ?
How is your cold , Meg ?
Jo , you look tired to death .
Come and kiss me , baby . &quot;
While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off , her warm slippers on , and sitting down in the easy-chair , drew Amy to her lap , preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day .
The girls flew about , trying to make things comfortable , each in her own way .
Meg arranged the <unk> ; Jo brought wood and set chairs , dropping , <unk> , and <unk> everything she touched ; Beth <unk> to and fro between parlor and kitchen , quiet and busy ; while Amy gave directions to every one , as she sat with her hands folded .
As they gathered about the table , Mrs. March said , with a particularly happy face , &quot; I &apos;ve got a treat for you after supper . &quot;
A quick , bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine .
Beth clapped her hands , regardless of the <unk> she held , and Jo tossed up her napkin , crying , &quot; A letter !
a letter !
Three cheers for father ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , a nice long letter .
He is well , and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared .
He sends all sorts of loving wishes for Christmas , and an especial message to you girls , &quot; said Mrs. March , patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there .
&quot; <unk> and get done !
Don &apos;t stop to <unk> your little finger , and <unk> over your plate , Amy , &quot; cried Jo , <unk> in her tea , and dropping her bread , butter side down , on the carpet , in her haste to get at the treat .
Beth ate no more , but crept away , to sit in her <unk> corner and brood over the delight to come , till the others were ready .
&quot; I think it was so splendid in father to go as a <unk> when he was too old to be <unk> , and not strong enough for a <unk> , &quot; said Meg warmly .
&quot; Don &apos;t I wish I could go as a <unk> , a _ <unk> _ <unk> &apos;s its name ?
or a nurse , so I could be near him and help him , &quot; exclaimed Jo , with a groan .
&quot; It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent , and eat all sorts of <unk> things , and drink out of a tin <unk> , &quot; sighed Amy .
&quot; When will he come home , Marmee ? &quot;
asked Beth , with a little quiver in her voice .
&quot; Not for many months , dear , unless he is sick .
He will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can , and we won &apos;t ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared .
Now come and hear the letter . &quot;
They all drew to the fire , mother in the big chair with Beth at her feet , Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair , and Jo leaning on the back , where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching .
Very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching , especially those which <unk> sent home .
In this one little was said of the hardships <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> conquered ; it was a cheerful , hopeful letter , full of lively <unk> of camp life , <unk> , and <unk> news ; and only at the end did the writer &apos;s heart <unk> with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home .
&#91; Illustration : It was a cheerful , hopeful letter &#93; &quot; Give them all my dear love and a kiss .
Tell them I think of them by day , pray for them by night , and find my best comfort in their affection at all times .
A year seems very long to wait before I see them , but remind them that while we wait we may all work , so that these hard days need not be wasted .
I know they will remember all I said to them , that they will be loving children to you , will do their duty faithfully , fight their bosom enemies bravely , and conquer themselves so beautifully , that when I come back to them I may be <unk> and prouder than ever of my little women . &quot;
Everybody sniffed when they came to that part ; Jo wasn &apos;t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose , and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother &apos;s shoulder and sobbed out , &quot; I _ am _ a selfish girl !
but I &apos;ll truly try to be better , so he <unk> &apos;t be disappointed in me by and by . &quot;
&quot; We all will ! &quot;
cried Meg .
&quot; I think too much of my looks , and hate to work , but won &apos;t any more , if I can help it . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll try and be what he loves to call me , &apos; a little woman , &apos; and not be rough and wild ; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else , &quot; said Jo , thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than <unk> a rebel or two down <unk> .
Beth said nothing , but wiped away her tears with the blue <unk> , and began to knit with all her might , losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her , while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home .
&#91; Illustration : How you used to play Pilgrim &apos;s Progress &#93; Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo &apos;s words , by saying in her cheery voice , &quot; Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim &apos;s Progress when you were little things ?
Nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my <unk> on your backs for burdens , give you hats and sticks and <unk> of paper , and let you travel through the house from the cellar , which was the City of <unk> , up , up , to the <unk> , where you had all the lovely things you could <unk> to make a Celestial City . &quot;
&quot; What fun it was , especially going by the lions , fighting <unk> , and passing through the Valley where the <unk> were ! &quot;
said Jo .
&quot; I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled down stairs , &quot; said Meg .
&quot; My favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our flowers and <unk> and pretty things were , and all stood and sung for joy up there in the sunshine , &quot; said Beth , smiling , as if that pleasant moment had come back to her .
&quot; I don &apos;t remember much about it , except that I was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry , and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top .
If I wasn &apos;t too old for such things , I &apos;d rather like to play it over again , &quot; said Amy , who began to talk of <unk> childish things at the <unk> age of twelve .
&quot; We never are too old for this , my dear , because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another .
Our burdens are here , our road is before us , and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that <unk> us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City .
Now , my little pilgrims , suppose you begin again , not in play , but in earnest , and see how far on you can get before father comes home . &quot;
&quot; Really , mother ?
Where are our bundles ? &quot;
asked Amy , who was a very <unk> young lady .
&quot; Each of you told what your burden was just now , except Beth ; I rather think she hasn &apos;t got any , &quot; said her mother .
&quot; Yes , I have ; mine is dishes and <unk> , and <unk> girls with nice <unk> , and being afraid of people . &quot;
Beth &apos;s bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh ; but nobody did , for it would have hurt her feelings very much .
&quot; Let us do it , &quot; said Meg thoughtfully .
&quot; It is only another name for trying to be good , and the story may help us ; for though we do want to be good , it &apos;s hard work , and we forget , and don &apos;t do our best . &quot;
&quot; We were in the <unk> of <unk> to-night , and mother came and pulled us out as <unk> did in the book .
We ought to have our roll of directions , like Christian .
What shall we do about that ? &quot;
asked Jo , delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty .
&quot; Look under your pillows , Christmas morning , and you will find your guide-book , &quot; replied Mrs. March .
They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table ; then out came the four little <unk> , and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for Aunt March .
It was uninteresting sewing , but to-night no one <unk> .
They <unk> Jo &apos;s plan of <unk> the long <unk> into four parts , and calling the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and America , and in that way got on capitally , especially when they talked about the different <unk> as they <unk> their way through them .

No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano ; but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys , and making a pleasant <unk> to the simple songs they sung .
Meg had a voice like a <unk> , and she and her mother led the little <unk> .
Amy chirped like a cricket , and Jo <unk> through the airs at her own sweet will , always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a <unk> that spoilt the most pensive tune .
They had always done this from the time they could <unk> &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &apos; <unk> &apos; <unk> , &quot; and it had become a household <unk> , for the mother was a born <unk> .
The first sound in the morning was her voice , as she went about the house singing like a lark ; and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound , for the girls never grew too old for that familiar <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : At nine they stopped work and sung as usual &#93; &#91; Illustration : A Merry Christmas &#93; <unk> .
A <unk> CHRISTMAS .
Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning .
No stockings hung at the <unk> , and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago , when her little sock fell down because it was so <unk> with <unk> .
Then she remembered her mother &apos;s promise , and , <unk> her hand under her pillow , drew out a little <unk> book .
She knew it very well , for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived , and Jo felt that it was a true guide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey .
She woke Meg with a &quot; Merry Christmas , &quot; and bade her see what was under her pillow .
A <unk> book appeared , with the same picture inside , and a few words written by their mother , which made their one present very precious in their eyes .
Presently Beth and Amy woke , to rummage and find their little books also , --one dove-colored , the other blue ; and all sat looking at and talking about them , while the east grew rosy with the coming day .
In spite of her small vanities , Margaret had a sweet and <unk> nature , which unconsciously <unk> her sisters , especially Jo , who loved her very tenderly , and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given .
&quot; Girls , &quot; said Meg seriously , looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little <unk> ones in the room beyond , &quot; mother wants us to read and love and mind these books , and we must begin at once .
We used to be faithful about it ; but since father went away , and all this war trouble unsettled us , we have neglected many things .
You can do as you please ; but _ I _ shall keep my book on the table here , and read a little every morning as soon as I wake , for I know it will do me good , and help me through the day . &quot;
Then she opened her new book and began to read .
Jo put her arm round her , and , leaning cheek to cheek , read also , with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face .
&quot; How good Meg is !
Come , Amy , let &apos;s do as they do .
I &apos;ll help you with the hard words , and they &apos;ll explain things if we don &apos;t understand , &quot; whispered Beth , very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters &apos; example .
&quot; I &apos;m glad mine is blue , &quot; said Amy ; and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned , and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting .
&quot; Where is mother ? &quot;
asked Meg , as she and Jo ran down to thank her for their gifts , half an hour later .
&quot; <unk> only knows .
Some poor <unk> come <unk> &apos; , and your ma went straight off to see what was needed .
There never _ was _ such a woman for <unk> &apos; away <unk> and drink , clothes and <unk> &apos; , &quot; replied Hannah , who had lived with the family since Meg was born , and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant .
&quot; She will be back soon , I think ; so <unk> your <unk> , and have everything ready , &quot; said Meg , looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa , ready to be produced at the proper time .
&quot; Why , where is Amy &apos;s bottle of cologne ? &quot;
she added , as the little <unk> did not appear .
&quot; She took it out a minute ago , and went off with it to put a ribbon on it , or some such notion , &quot; replied Jo , dancing about the room to take the first <unk> off the new <unk> .
&quot; How nice my handkerchiefs look , don &apos;t they ?
Hannah <unk> and <unk> them for me , and I marked them all myself , &quot; said Beth , looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor .
&quot; Bless the child !
she &apos;s gone and put &apos; Mother &apos; on them instead of &apos; M.
March . &apos;
How funny ! &quot;
cried Jo , taking up one .
&quot; Isn &apos;t it right ?
I thought it was better to do it so , because Meg &apos;s <unk> are &apos; M.
M. , &apos; and I don &apos;t want any one to use these but Marmee , &quot; said Beth , looking troubled .
&quot; It &apos;s all right , dear , and a very pretty idea , <unk> sensible , too , for no one can ever mistake now .
It will please her very much , I know , &quot; said Meg , with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth .
&quot; There &apos;s mother .
<unk> the basket , quick ! &quot;
cried Jo , as a door <unk> , and steps sounded in the hall .
Amy came in hastily , and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her .
&quot; Where have you been , and what are you hiding behind you ? &quot;
asked Meg , surprised to see , by her hood and cloak , that lazy Amy had been out so early .
&quot; Don &apos;t laugh at me , Jo !
I didn &apos;t mean any one should know till the time came .
I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one , and I gave _ all _ my money to get it , and I &apos;m truly trying not to be selfish any more . &quot;
As she spoke , Amy showed the handsome <unk> which replaced the cheap one ; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that Meg hugged her on the spot , and Jo pronounced her &quot; a trump , &quot; while Beth ran to the window , and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle .
&quot; You see I felt ashamed of my present , after reading and talking about being good this morning , so I ran round the corner and changed it the minute I was up : and I &apos;m _ so _ glad , for mine is the <unk> now . &quot;
Another bang of the <unk> sent the basket under the sofa , and the girls to the table , eager for breakfast .
&quot; Merry Christmas , Marmee !
Many of them !
Thank you for our books ; we read some , and mean to every day , &quot; they cried , in chorus .
&quot; Merry Christmas , little daughters !
I &apos;m glad you began at once , and hope you will keep on .
But I want to say one word before we sit down .
Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little <unk> baby .
Six children are <unk> into one bed to keep from <unk> , for they have no fire .
There is nothing to eat over there ; and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering <unk> and cold .
My girls , will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present ? &quot;
They were all unusually hungry , having waited nearly an hour , and for a minute no one spoke ; only a minute , for Jo exclaimed <unk> , -- &quot; I &apos;m so glad you came before we began ! &quot;
&quot; May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children ? &quot;
asked Beth , eagerly .
&quot; _ I _ shall take the cream and the <unk> , &quot; added Amy , heroically giving up the articles she most liked .
Meg was already covering the <unk> , and <unk> the bread into one big plate .
&quot; I thought you &apos;d do it , &quot; said Mrs. March , smiling as if satisfied .
&quot; You shall all go and help me , and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast , and make it up at <unk> . &quot;
They were soon ready , and the procession set out .
Fortunately it was early , and they went through back <unk> , so few people saw them , and no one laughed at the queer party .
&#91; Illustration : The procession set out &#93; A poor , bare , miserable room it was , with broken windows , no fire , ragged <unk> , a sick mother , wailing baby , and a group of pale , hungry children cuddled under one old <unk> , trying to keep warm .
How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in !
&quot; <unk> , <unk> Gott !
it is good angels come to us ! &quot;
said the poor woman , crying for joy .
&quot; <unk> angels in <unk> and <unk> , &quot; said Jo , and set them laughing .
In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there .
Hannah , who had carried wood , made a fire , and stopped up the broken <unk> with old hats and her own cloak .
Mrs. March gave the mother tea and <unk> , and comforted her with promises of help , while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own .
The girls , meantime , spread the table , set the children round the fire , and fed them like so many hungry birds , <unk> , talking , and trying to understand the funny broken English .
&quot; <unk> ist <unk> ! &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
cried the poor things , as they ate , and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze .
The girls had never been called angel children before , and thought it very agreeable , especially Jo , who had been considered a &quot; Sancho &quot; ever since she was born .
That was a very happy breakfast , though they didn &apos;t get any of it ; and when they went away , leaving comfort behind , I think there were not in all the city four <unk> people than the hungry little girls who gave away their <unk> and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning .
&quot; That &apos;s loving our neighbor better than ourselves , and I like it , &quot; said Meg , as they set out their presents , while their mother was upstairs <unk> clothes for the poor Hummels .
Not a very splendid show , but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles ; and the tall vase of red roses , white <unk> , and <unk> vines , which stood in the middle , gave quite an elegant air to the table .
&quot; She &apos;s coming !
<unk> up , Beth !
<unk> the door , Amy !
Three cheers for Marmee ! &quot;
cried Jo , prancing about , while Meg went to <unk> mother to the seat of honor .
Beth played her <unk> march , Amy threw open the door , and Meg <unk> escort with great dignity .
Mrs. March was both surprised and touched ; and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents , and read the little notes which accompanied them .
The slippers went on at once , a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket , well <unk> with Amy &apos;s cologne , the rose was fastened in her bosom , and the nice gloves were pronounced a &quot; perfect fit . &quot;
There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and <unk> , in the simple , loving fashion which makes these <unk> so pleasant at the time , so sweet to remember long afterward , and then all fell to work .
The morning <unk> and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening <unk> .
Being still too young to go often to the theatre , and not rich enough to afford any great <unk> for private performances , the girls put their wits to work , <unk> being the mother of invention , <unk> whatever they needed .
Very clever were some of their <unk> , <unk> <unk> , antique lamps made of old-fashioned <unk> covered with silver paper , gorgeous <unk> of old cotton , <unk> with tin <unk> from a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> covered with the same useful <unk> bits , left in sheets when the <unk> of tin <unk> were cut out .
The furniture was used to being turned topsy-turvy , and the big <unk> was the scene of many innocent <unk> .
No gentlemen were <unk> ; so Jo played <unk> parts to her heart &apos;s content , and took immense satisfaction in a pair of <unk> boots given her by a friend , who knew a lady who knew an <unk> .
These boots , an old <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> once used by an artist for some picture , were Jo &apos;s chief treasures , and appeared on all occasions .
The <unk> of the company made it necessary for the two <unk> actors to take several parts apiece ; and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts , whisking in and out of various costumes , and <unk> the stage <unk> .
It was excellent <unk> for their <unk> , a harmless amusement , and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle , lonely , or spent in less profitable society .
On Christmas night , a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the <unk> , and sat before the blue and yellow <unk> curtains in a most flattering state of <unk> .
There was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain , a trifle of <unk> , and an occasional <unk> from Amy , who was apt to get <unk> in the excitement of the moment .
Presently a bell sounded , the curtains flew apart , and the <unk> <unk> began .
&quot; A gloomy wood , &quot; according to the one <unk> , was represented by a few <unk> in pots , green <unk> on the floor , and a cave in the distance .
This cave was made with a <unk> for a roof , <unk> for walls ; and in it was a small <unk> in full <unk> , with a black pot on it , and an old witch bending over it .
The stage was dark , and the glow of the <unk> had a fine effect , especially as real <unk> issued from the <unk> when the witch took off the cover .
A moment was allowed for the first thrill to <unk> ; then Hugo , the villain , stalked in with a <unk> sword at his side , a <unk> hat , black beard , mysterious cloak , and the boots .
After <unk> to and fro in much <unk> , he struck his forehead , and burst out in a wild strain , singing of his <unk> to Roderigo , his love for Zara , and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other .
The gruff <unk> of Hugo &apos;s voice , with an occasional shout when his feelings <unk> him , were very impressive , and the audience <unk> the moment he paused for breath .
<unk> with the air of one accustomed to public praise , he stole to the <unk> , and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding &quot; What <unk> , <unk> !
I need thee ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face &#93; Out came Meg , with gray horse-hair hanging about her face , a red and black <unk> , a staff , and <unk> signs upon her cloak .
Hugo demanded a <unk> to make Zara adore him , and one to destroy Roderigo .
Hagar , in a fine dramatic melody , promised both , and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love <unk> : -- &quot; <unk> , <unk> , from thy home , <unk> <unk> , I bid thee come !
<unk> of roses , fed on dew , <unk> and potions <unk> thou <unk> ?
Bring me here , with <unk> speed , The fragrant <unk> which I need ; Make it sweet and <unk> and strong , <unk> , answer now my song ! &quot;
&#91; Illustration : A little figure in cloudy white &#93; A soft strain of music sounded , and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white , with <unk> wings , golden hair , and a garland of roses on its head .
<unk> a <unk> , it sang , -- &quot; <unk> I come , From my airy home , <unk> in the silver moon .
Take the magic spell , And use it well , Or its power will <unk> soon ! &quot;
And , dropping a small , <unk> bottle at the witch &apos;s feet , the spirit vanished .
Another <unk> from Hagar produced another <unk> , --not a lovely one ; for , with a bang , an ugly black <unk> appeared , and , having croaked a reply , tossed a dark bottle at Hugo , and disappeared with a <unk> laugh .
Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots , Hugo departed ; and Hagar informed the audience that , as he had killed a few of her friends in times past , she has <unk> him , and <unk> to <unk> his plans , and be <unk> on him .
Then the curtain fell , and the audience reposed and ate <unk> while discussing the <unk> of the play .
A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again ; but when it became evident what a <unk> of <unk> had been got up , no one murmured at the delay .
It was truly <unk> !
A tower rose to the <unk> ; <unk> up appeared a window , with a lamp burning at it , and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver dress , waiting for Roderigo .
He came in gorgeous array , with <unk> cap , red cloak , chestnut <unk> , a <unk> , and the boots , of course .
<unk> at the foot of the tower , he sang a serenade in <unk> <unk> .
Zara replied , and , after a musical <unk> , consented to fly .
Then came the grand effect of the play .
Roderigo produced a <unk> , with five steps to it , threw up one end , and invited Zara to <unk> .
<unk> she crept from her <unk> , put her hand on Roderigo &apos;s shoulder , and was about to leap gracefully down , when , &quot; <unk> !
alas for Zara ! &quot;
she forgot her train , --it caught in the window ; the tower <unk> , leaned forward , fell with a crash , and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins !
A <unk> <unk> arose as the <unk> boots waved wildly from the wreck , and a golden head emerged , exclaiming , &quot; I told you so !
I told you so ! &quot;
With wonderful presence of mind , Don Pedro , the cruel sire , rushed in , dragged out his daughter , with a hasty aside , -- &quot; Don &apos;t laugh !
Act as if it was all right ! &quot;
--and , <unk> Roderigo up , <unk> him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn .
Though decidedly shaken by the fall of the tower upon him , Roderigo defied the old gentleman , and refused to stir .
This <unk> example fired Zara : she also defied her sire , and he ordered them both to the deepest <unk> of the castle .
A stout little <unk> came in with chains , and led them away , looking very much frightened , and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made .
Act third was the castle hall ; and here Hagar appeared , having come to free the lovers and finish Hugo .
She <unk> him coming , and <unk> ; sees him put the potions into two cups of wine , and bid the timid little servant &quot; <unk> them to the <unk> in their <unk> , and tell them I shall come <unk> . &quot;
The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something , and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless .
<unk> , the &quot; <unk> , &quot; carries them away , and Hagar <unk> back the cup which holds the <unk> meant for Roderigo .
Hugo , getting <unk> after a long <unk> , <unk> it , <unk> his wits , and , after a good deal of <unk> and <unk> , falls flat and dies ; while Hagar <unk> him what she has done in a song of <unk> power and melody .
This was a truly thrilling scene , though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long hair rather <unk> the effect of the villain &apos;s death .
He was called before the curtain , and with great propriety appeared , leading Hagar , whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together .
Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of <unk> himself , because he has been told that Zara has deserted him .
Just as the <unk> is at his heart , a lovely song is sung under his window , <unk> him that Zara is true , but in danger , and he can save her , if he will .
A key is thrown in , which <unk> the door , and in a <unk> of rapture he tears off his chains , and <unk> away to find and rescue his <unk> .
