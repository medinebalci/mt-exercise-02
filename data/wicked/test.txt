Something just-- comes over me , sometimes .
Something I can &apos;t control ... And when it does ... bad things happen .
MORRIBLE If you can learn to use your powers ... in the right way ... Morrible , deeply moved , regards her new student-- MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Oh , Miss Elphaba ... SONG : &quot; THE WIZARD AND I &quot; MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD MIGHT MAKE YOU HIS MAGIC GRAND VIZIER ELPHABA The Wizard ! ?

Morrible smiles , leaves her .
Elphaba is now al one-- and thunderstruck , trying to absorb what just transpired .
ELPHABA DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN ?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD ?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I &apos;VE TRIED 26 TO SUPPRESS OR HIDE IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD IF I MAKE GOOD SO I &apos;LL MAKE GOOD ... Elphaba hop stones across a rivulet , Frogs leaping off the stones as she lands on the other side ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD WHAT I &apos;VE WAITED FOR SINCE -- SINCE BIRTH !
She arrives at some steps , climbs them ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM BY MY LOOKS , HE WON &apos;T BE BLINDED DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB ?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS , SO SMALL-MINDED ?
NO !
She finds a bench at the top of the steps ... as Crickets jump out of her path ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) HE &apos;LL SAY TO ME : &quot; I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY ! &quot;
AND THAT &apos;S HOW WE &apos;LL BEGIN THE WIZARD AND I ... She crosses into a garden in front of the library , alive with Ozian flowers swirling in the w ind ... 23A 23A EXT .
SHIZ - ENTRANCE COURTYARD - LIBRARY GARDEN - DAY ELPHABA ONCE I &apos;M WITH THE WIZARD MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE &apos; CUZ ONCE YOU &apos;RE WITH THE WIZARD NO ONE THINKS YOU &apos;RE STRANGE !
Bees fly out from among the flowers .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED AND ALL OF OZ HAS TO LOVE YOU WHEN BY THE WIZARD , YOU &apos;RE ACCLAIMED AND THIS GIFT -- OR THIS CURSE -- I HAVE INSIDE 27 MAYBE AT LAST , I &apos;LL KNOW WHY AS WE WORK HAND IN HAND THE WIZARD AND I !
AND ONE DAY , HE &apos;LL SAY TO ME : &quot; ELPHABA , A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR SHOULDN &apos;T A GIRL WHO &apos;S SO GOOD INSIDE HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR ?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN ABSURD DEGREE SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDIGRIS WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT BY YOU IF I DE-GREENIFY YOU ? &quot;
There &apos;s a kinetic wind-sculpture .
She sees her reflection in multiple colors .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) AND THOUGH OF COURSE THAT &apos;S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME &quot; ALL RIGHT , WHY NOT ? &quot;
I &apos;LL REPLY She joyfully spins the sculpture and the wind picks up .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) OH , WHAT A PAIR WE &apos;LL BE THE WIZARD AND I ... WHAT A PAIR WE &apos;LL BE THE WIZARD AND-- The wind picks up .
The flowers in the garden start to wave .
She comes to an ancient , giant Wisteria tree .
Elphaba hears ECHOES OF CHEERS from somewhere far off .
Sh e crosses under the hanging branches to find another , larger sculpture , this one of the Wizard &apos;s head .
She stares into the moving sculpture , almost trancelike .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) UNLIMITED MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED AND I &apos;VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY She heads behind the sculpture , towards the source of the wind , which now sounds like-- applause .
23B 23B EXT .
SHIZ - FIELD &amp; EDGE OF CLIFF - DAY ELPHABA I KNOW -- IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY AND TRUE , THE VISION &apos;S HAZY BUT I SWEAR , SOMEDAY THERE &apos;LL BE A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT OZ 28 THAT &apos;S ALL TO DO-- WITH ME !
Elphaba crosses into an open field , the grass almost becoming the cheering crowd ...
Birds take flight around her .
Elphaba runs through this &quot; cheering crowd , &quot; drinking in this &quot; acclaim , &quot; this celebration happening ( in nature ) around her .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) AND I &apos;LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD FEELING THINGS I &apos;VE NEVER FELT AND THOUGH I &apos;D NEVER SHOW IT I &apos;LL BE SO HAPPY , I COULD MELT AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AND I &apos;LL WANT NOTHING ELSE TILL I DIE HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME , THEY WILL SCREAM FOR HALF OF OZ &apos;S FAV &apos;RITE TEAM : Elphaba looks into the distant horizon .
We see she &apos;s standing at the edge of a dramatic cliff overlooking waves that are made of not water but sand , moving with the wind .
This is the very edge of Oz .
She takes in the exhilarating sig ht .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) THE WIZARD-- AND I !
As Elphaba walks away , blowing leaves and flowers whip past her and fly off the edge of the cliff , fluttering down towards the sandy shore below .
23C 23C INT .
SHIZ - DORMITORY CORRIDOR - EVENING Elphaba looks around at the room numbers , looking for hers .
She spots the right door , lets herself in-- 24 24 INT .
SHIZ - THE GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - EVENING Elphaba &apos;s POV : Galinda .
The two girls regard each other warily , like two natural enemies in the wild .
Then Elphaba pushes brusquely past her into the room .
She surveys Galinda &apos;s fluffy possessions-- nearly everywhere .
ELPHABA Do you really think this is fair ?
GALINDA I do not , as I was promised a private suite .
But thanks for asking !
29 Elphaba moves toward Galinda , who backs away uneasily .
Elphaba moves past Galinda , towards the balcony door ... ELPHABA ( her patience fraying ) I &apos;m just shutting the door !
Galinda moves peremptorily to the door .
GALINDA Oh , do you mind leaving it open ?
I so enjoy ... air !
Galinda eyes Elphaba with carefully feigned casualness-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) I saved you some space , by the way .
Galinda gestures grandly to one c orner : where there &apos;s a diminutive daybed next to a tiny table with one drawer .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) ( as if she &apos;s been thanked ) It was nothing .
Roommates do these things for each other .
As Galinda continues , Elphaba goes to her bed .
Sits .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) For instance , and this is just an example , I could lend you some clothes , til your luggage arrives .
( Elphaba stares at her ) Since you &apos;ve-- nothing to wear .
ELPHABA ( jus t honest ) I &apos;ll have nothing to wear even after my luggage arrives .
GALINDA And in return , perhaps you could-- let &apos;s see-- put in a good word for me ?
With Madame Morrible ?
Deal ?
Elphaba decides to ignore this .
Galinda studies her .
Then-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) That was you .
Down there .
Who made all that happen .
Elphaba grows uncomfortable .
30 ELPHABA You heard Madame Morrible .
Galinda moves closer to Elphaba , fascinated .
GALINDA How did you do it ?
Tell me .
( Elphaba doesn &apos;t answer ) Please ?
I can keep a secret .
( still nothing ) Fine .
Be that way .
But it &apos;s a bit selfish on your part , I asked really nicely , plus , I saved you a drawer-- ELPHABA I don &apos;t know !
I &apos;VE NEVER KNOWN !
Suddenly the DOOR SLAMS SHUT , a pane of glass cracks , then shatters .
Gali nda stares at it , then-- at Elphaba .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) There .
A compromise .
25 25 EXT .
SHIZ - DORM - LATER THAT NIGHT All of the windows in the dorm go dark one by one as happy new ROOMMATES click off their lights for the night .
All but one .
In that last window , A PINK LIGHT GOES ON-- 26 26 INT .
SHIZ - GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - NIGHT By the glow of her pink Ozian lamp , Galinda writes at her bedside table .
She darts a glance over to : Elphaba &apos;s bed , then resumes writing , muttering-- GALINDA Dearest darlingest Momsie and Popsical ... And now we see , Elphaba too , is surreptitiously writing home ; also muttering to herself-- ELPHABA &quot; My dear Father ...
Thank you for agreeing to let me stay . &quot;
GALINDA &quot; Guess what ? &quot;
ELPHABA &quot; In regards t o your request that I move in with Nessa-- &quot; 31 GALINDA &quot; I can &apos;t hear your guesses because this is a letter . &quot;
ELPHABA &quot; I know she wouldn &apos;t want me to-- &quot; ( crosses that out ) &quot; I know how much she wants to be-- &quot; ( crosses that out ) GALINDA &quot; So I &apos;ll just tell you . &quot;
Both girls pause : how to phrase this-- ?
SONG : &quot; WHAT IS THIS FEELING ? &quot;
As both girls quietly , yet urgently , compose their letters ... ELPHABA / GALINDA THERE &apos;S BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER ROOMING HERE AT SHIZ ELPHABA BUT OF COURSE , I &apos;LL CARE FOR NESSA GALINDA BUT OF COURSE , I &apos;LL RISE ABOVE IT ELPHABA / GALINDA FOR I KNOW THAT &apos;S HOW YOU &apos;D WANT ME TO RESPOND YES , THERE &apos;S BEEN SOME CONFUSION FOR YOU SEE , MY ROOM-MATE IS ... GALINDA ( searches for words ) UNUSUALLY AND EXCEEDINGLY PECULIAR AND ALTOGETHER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE ... Elphaba , too , struggles to describe her roommate .
Finally : ELPHABA BLONDE .
Both girls sign their letters .
We see them from above , in their respective beds , unable to sleep .
Galinda , in a frilly pink nightie , turns off ( in Ozian manner ) her pink bedside night-lamp .
Elphaba , clad in worn underthings , punches her pillow .
Both girls suddenly fling off their cover s , as if hot-- 32 GALINDA WHAT IS THIS FEELING SO SUDDEN AND NEW ELPHABA I FELT THE MOMENT I LAID EYES ON YOU They toss and turn on their beds-- GALINDA MY PULSE IS RUSHING ... ELPHABA MY HEAD IS REELING .. GALINDA MY FACE IS FLUSHING ...
BOTH WHAT IS THIS FEELING ?
FERVID AS A FLAME DOES IT HAVE A NAME ?
Both sit up , experiencing a private , astounding revelation ...
BOTH ( CONT &apos;D ) YES !
LOATHING !
They rise , energized-- and come face to face i n the middle of the room-- what a relief to admit it !
BOTH ( CONT &apos;D ) UNADULTERATED LOATHING !
GALINDA FOR YOUR FACE ... ELPHABA YOUR VOICE ... GALINDA YOUR CLOTHING ... Each studies the other , marvels at the depth of revulsion-- BOTH LET &apos;S JUST SAY-- I LOATHE IT ALL !
Elphaba moves to Galinda &apos;s side and turns off the pink lamp .
Galinda is pissed .
This is war .
33 27 27 INT .
SHIZ - GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - MORNING Elphaba awakes to find herself surrounded by GALINDA &apos;S STUFF .
GALINDA EV &apos;RY LITTLE TRAIT , HOWEVER SMALL As Elphaba struggles to get through this pink barricade-- ELPHABA MAKES MY VERY FLESH BEGIN TO CRAWL BOTH WITH SIMPLE UTTER LOATHING Elphaba emerges disheveled and furious to find Galinda serenely putting the final touches on her perfect look-- BOTH ( CONT &apos;D ) THERE &apos;S A STRANGE EXHILARATION IN SUCH TOTAL DETE STATION IT &apos;S SO PURE !
SO STRONG !
Galinda exits with a smug smile-- 28 28 INT .
SHIZ - GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - LATER THAT DAY Galinda enters with Pfannee and ShenShen to find : HER PINK BELONGINGS now piled haphazardly on Galinda &apos;s side of the room .
Elphaba emerges from the balcony , smiles her own smug smile-- BOTH THOUGH I DO ADMIT IT CAME ON FAST STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN LAST AND I WILL BE LOATHING LOATHING YOU MY WHOLE LIFE LONG !
Elphaba exits , slamming the door , causing the pile of precious pink stuff to crash down and go everywhere-- Galinda &apos;s anger boils over into a scream , as we CUT TO : 29 29 EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD / JUST OUTSIDE DINING HALL - DAY Galinda confidently strides towards the dining hall , trailed by her many friends .
STUDENTS DEAR GALINDA YOU ARE JUST TOO GOOD HOW DO YOU STAND IT ?
I DON &apos;T THINK I COULD !
SHE &apos;S A TERROR !
SHE &apos;S A TARTAR !
34 WE DON &apos;T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS BUT GALINDA , YOU &apos;RE A MARTYR !
GALINDA WELL-- Galinda stops at the entrance to the dining hall , turns back to her friends-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) THESE THINGS ARE SENT TO TRY US !
Galinda realizes they &apos;re all staring past her , through the glass .
She spins around , to see what they &apos;re staring at : GALINDA &apos;S POV : ELPHABA , in the dining hall .
As the Students enter the dining hall ... STUDENTS POO R GALINDA , FORCED TO RESIDE WITH SOMEONE SO DISGUSTIKAFIED WE JUST WANT TO TELL YOU : WE &apos;RE ALL ON YOUR SIDE !
30 30 INT .
DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS Elphaba looks up from getting her food , to find Galinda and company all staring coldly at her .
STUDENTS WE SHARE YOUR-- Elphaba tries to find a seat , but people keep sitting where she &apos;s about to sit .
STUDENTS ( CONT &apos;D ) GALINDA AND ELPHABA WHAT IS THIS FEELING ?
L OATHING SO SUDDEN AND NEW ?
UNADULTERATED LOATHING FOR I FELT THE MOMENT HER FACE , HER VOICE HER I LAID EYES ON YOU CLOTHING MY PULSE IS RUSHING LET &apos;S JUST SAY : MY HEAD IS REELING WE LOATHE IT ALL !
EV &apos;RY OH , WHAT IS THIS FEELING ?
LITTLE TRAIT HOWEVER SMALL DOES IT HAVE A NAME ?
YES ... MAKES OUR VERY FLESH BEGIN TO AHHH ...
CRAWL AHHH ... ALL AHHH-- !
Finally Elphaba , defiant , plunks herself down right opposite Galinda .
Galinda &apos;s pals , anticipating unpleasantness , take off , leaving the two roommates to deal with each other .
35 31 31 INT .
/ EXT - SHIZ CLASSROOM / SPORTS AREA ( INTERCUT ) GALINDA AND ELPHABA STUDENTS LOATHING THERE &apos;S A STRANGE LOATHING !
EXHILARATION LOATHING !
IN SUCH TOTAL DETESTATION LOATHING !
IT &apos;S SO PURE , SO STRONG !
SO STRONG !
ELPHABA / GALINDA THOUGH I DO ADMIT IT CAME ON FAST STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN LAST 32 32 EXT .
SHIZ CAMPUS - QUAD - DAY Galinda , along with virtually the entire student body , dances , claiming her victory-- GALINDA AND ELPHABA STUDENTS AND I WILL BE LOATHING FOR LOATHING FOREVER LOATHING TRULY , LOATHING DEEPLY LOATHING YOU LOATHING , LOATHING YOU !
MY WHOLE LIFE LONG !
Suddenly Galinda spots Elphaba , up above , at the entrance to Morrible &apos;s quarters , being greeted by Morrible-- STUDENTS ( CONT &apos;D ) LOATHING !
UNADULTERATED LOATHING !
33 33 INT .
SHIZ - GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - EVENING Galinda enters their room , relieved to find herself alone , until-- Elphaba pops out at her from the balcony-- ELPHABA Boo .
Galinda YELPS .
Elphaba CACKLES .
33A 33A EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD - EARLY MORNING Students rush across campus to get to class on time .
34 34 INT .
SHIZ - DR. DILLAMOND &apos;S CLASSROOM - DAY Elphaba enters the History class .
As Students , including Galinda , Pfannee , ShenShen , Boq and Nessa take their seats ... AVARIC ( attractive , bookish ) goes to take the open seat next to Nessa , but another STUDENT sits there first , as-- 36 DILLAMOND ( O.S. )
Settle down , ladies and gentlemen ; settle down now-- !
Doctor Dillamond enters ... DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) I have read your most recent essays , and I am amazed to report some progress .
Although some of us still tend to favor form over content-- ( hands Galinda her paper ) Miss Glllinda .
GALINDA It &apos;s Ga-linda .
With a &quot; Ga . &quot; DILLAMOND Yes , of course .
( he tries , but ... ) Glllinda .
GALINDA ( huffily ) I don &apos;t see what t he problem is-- every other professor manages to pronouncify my name .
ELPHABA Maybe the pronuncifi-cation of your precious name is not the sole focus of Doctor Dillamond &apos;s life .
Maybe he &apos;s not like every other Professor , maybe some of us are different !
Nessa shoots her sister a look : quiet !
GALINDA It seems the artichoke is steamed .
Everyone LAUGHS ; Boq LAUGHS a beat too long .
Nessa clocks Boq &apos;s amusem ent , starts to LAUGH with him , but then-- she sees Elphaba &apos;s hurt expression and quickly stops herself .
DILLAMOND We Goats lack upper front teeth .
Which accounts for the mispronunciation , Miss-- Glllinda .
37 Using an Ozian slide projector ( involving mirrors and sunlight coming through a hole in a window shade ) Dillamond shows them A SUCCESSION OF IMAGES : Animals , contributing to Ozian society , alongside humans .
On one slide , A FROG AND A RABBIT SCIENTIST , IN GOGGLES AND LAB COATS , CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENT .
In the last slide , we see A MUCH YOUNGER DILLAMOND , IN SHIZ HALL , LECTURING TO HUMAN AND ANIMAL STU DENTS-- as WE HEAR : DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) Some of us are different .
And there was a time , before you were born , when life in Oz was different .
When one could walk these halls , and hear-- a Snow Leopard , solving an equation , or an Antelope , explicating a sonnet .
So ... when , and why-- did this change ?
Elphaba raises her hand .
ELPHABA From what I &apos;ve read , it began with the Great Drought .
DILLAMOND Precisely .
Food gre w scarce .
When people are hungry , and-- angry , they begin to look for-- ELPHABA Someone to blame .
&#91; Alt : A scapegoat . &#93;
Elphaba &apos;s eyes meet Dillamond &apos;s .
Galinda raises her hand .
DILLAMOND Yes , Miss Gllll-- GALINDA It &apos;s GA-linda .
And why can &apos;t you just teach us history , instead of always harping on the past ?
Other students , except Elphaba , MURMUR their agreement .
DILLAMOND Because we cannot escape the past .
A nd we ignore it at our own peril .
The past helps explain our present circumstances .
For instance , if we examine this timeline-- 38 He flips the chalkboard over : The entire CLASS GASPS .
SCRAWLED IN BLOOD RED PAINT ACROSS DILLAMOND &apos;S TIMELINE : &quot; animals should be seen and not heard . &quot;
Dillamond , shaken , stares at the disturbing words .
Elphaba , horrified , looks from the words , to her teacher ... DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) Who is responsible for this ?
He waits .
Elphaba &apos;s anger grows as the shocked students look at each other , silent , uncomfortable ; until finally-- DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) Very well , class dismissed .
Elphaba looks like she &apos;s going to explode .
Seeing this , Nessa anxiously puts her hand on Elphaba-- when suddenly-- CRASH !
Everyone jumps !
Dillamond has backed into his desk , a vase holding an array of poppies has fallen-- and lies shattered on the floor .
DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) I said class dismissed !
The students scramble out of there , except for Elphaba .
She quietly gathers the poppies that fell from his desk .
ELPHABA Your lovely poppies !
Elphaba carefully gathers them up , sees a watering can , on his window le dge , places the poppies in it ... DILLAMOND ( still shaken ) Thank you , you &apos;re very kind .
( re : poppies ) They &apos;re my favorite .
They keep me cheerful ... in these dark times .
She glances again at those awful words on the board , as Dillamond opens a cupboard , takes out a little broom ... DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) Miss Elphaba-- please .
Go and join your friends ELPHABA It &apos;s alright , I have no friends .
He can &apos;t help but LAUGH .
Th en ... 39 DILLAMOND Well .
Maybe ... one .
He smiles .
She smiles back .
He starts to sweep up the broken glass as Elphaba walks past the blood red words ... and exits .
MORRIBLE ( PRE-LAP ) Try again .
35 35 INT .
SHIZ - MORRIBLE &apos;S QUARTERS - DAY Elphaba stands in front of a table with an Ozian coin placed on it .
Morrible , nearby , provides quiet guidance ... MORRIBLE Eyes shut .
Toes clenched .
Are your toes clenched ?
ELPHABA I-- think so .
MORRIBLE And picture it .
Are you picturing ?
Elphaba nods ... eyes shut ... clenching ... picturing ... MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Now ... levitate the coin .
Elphaba takes a deep breath ... tries .
Then-- opens her eyes : The coin hasn &apos;t b udged .
Elphaba slams the table with her fist in frustration .
Morrible grabs her hand , concerned , motherly .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) I hear there was an unfortunate disturbance in Doctor Dillamond &apos;s class today .
That must have been distressful for you .
Elphaba nods , relieved : she understands .
ELPHABA Someone wrote those horrendible words , on purpose , for him to see-- I just wish-- She breaks off , pacing now , fists clenched , rage building-- MORRIBLE ( egging her on ) What .
You wish-- what ?
40 ELPHABA That there was something I could do !
Because no one should be-- Elphaba breaks off , stares at the coin , like she &apos;s thinking-- if only I could levitate that , maybe I could do something .
MORRIBLE No one should be what ?
ELPHABA Scorned , or laughed at , or looked down upon , or told to stop jabbering AND KEEP QUIET !
The coin suddenly FLIES from the table at high speed , like a BULLET , smashing into the mirror on Morrible &apos;s mantle .
Madame Morrible stares at her with admiration .
Even ... awe .
MORRIBLE Remarkable .
Absolutely remarkable .
Elphaba stares at the shattered glass , shocked .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Once you learn to harness your emotions ... the sky &apos;s the limit .
Elphaba absorbs this .
Inspired by it .
36 36 EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD - DUSK Elphaba exits Morrible &apos;s quarters , lost in thought , heading back to her dorm when she catches sight of : Doctor Dillamond , hurriedly crossing the quad .
ELPHABA Doctor Dillamond !
Did you find out who-- But he either doesn &apos;t hear or is too intent on where he &apos;s going to stop ...
He races off .
She rushes after him .
37 37 EXT .
OUTSKIRTS OF SHIZ CAMPUS - DUSK Elphaba , breathless , approaches a remote area of campus , passing a dilapidated sign : &quot; Faculty Housing -- ANIMAL . &quot;
Nestled amongst a few small , odd buildings that have fallen into disrepair , Elphaba finds ... one light on , in one house .
41 38 38 INT . / EXT .
DILLAMOND &apos;S DWELLING - DUSK Elphaba approaches , hesitates-- is about to knock when she hears her teacher &apos;s voice : DILLAMOND ( O.S. )
This is much bigger than just some words on a chalkboard .
Elphaba freezes , listens-- DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) We Animals are now being blamed for everything that goes wrong .
Forced from our jobs .
Told to keep silent .
Elphaba moves to the window , peers through the crack in the curtain .
( She hears snippets , sees on ly pieces ... ) ELPHABA &apos;S POV : Dillamond huddles with the Bird Professor , and other Animals : a LEOPARD , a DEER , an OWL , a FROG , TAMARIN , and a SQUIRREL , all speak in tense , urgent WHISPERS ...
DEER We can still converse in private , thank Oz .
LEOPARD Not after dark .
Not without a speech permit .
Outside , Elphaba is troubled by what she &apos;s hearing ... DILLAMOND A dear friend of mine-- DEER A Deer ?
DILLAMOND A Co w , actually .
She &apos;s been speaking out , at protests , and recently wrote me , asking to meet at a cafe .
She said it was urgent ... That day , I was shown to their new non-speaking section .
Dillamond , using an Ozian contraption , lights his pipe ... BIRD And ?
What did your Deer friend-- SQUIRREL / FROG Cow-- 42 LEOPARD What did she tell you ?
DILLAMOND She never showed .
And no one &apos;s seen her since .
A silence , as this sinks in .
Then ... TAMARIN Yesterday a Badger acquaintance , a solicitor , was sacked .
Just for arguing a case !
OWL Who ?
DILLAMOND At least he can still argue .
LEOPARD What do you mean ? ?
Dillamond puffs his pipe .
Then looks back at them , grave .
Outside , Elphaba is riveted ... SONG : &quot; SOMETHING BAD &quot; DILLAMOND I &apos;VE HEARD OF AN OX A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX NO LONGER PERMITTED TO TEACH WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH !
Shocked by this , the Bird , Deer , Tamarin , Owl , Leopard , Squirrel and Frog all MURMUR to each other ... Outside , Elphaba , also deeply shaken by this , peers closer-- DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK FORBIDDEN TO PREACH NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH ONLY RUMORS -- BU T STILL -- ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE TO ANYONE WITH PAWS SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN OZ-- As the other Animals MURMUR anxiously : ANIMALS SOMETHING BAD , HAPPENING IN-- 43 LEOPARD That &apos;s it !
I &apos;m leaving Oz !
While I can still speak the word &quot; goodbye . &quot;
DEER Leave Oz ?
The Owl , Tamarin , Squirrel and Frog all react , alarmed .
Outside , Elphaba , equally shocked , takes a step backwards , steadies herself against the window for a moment .
And then-- AN IMAGE FLASHES before her eyes in BLACK AND WHITE : it looks like a barnyard .
Animals , unclothed , fenced in , emitting PLAINTIVE SOUNDS ... Elphaba GASPS .
Then , she blinks , coming back to reality , confused and troubled by what she &apos;s just seen .
Inside , hearing her gasp , the Animals freeze-- ears twitch , fur and feathers stand at attention .
Dillamond moves swiftly to his door , sticks his head out , and sees ... DILLAMOND Miss Elphaba ? !
What are you doing here ?
Before she can respond , he looks around ; motions h er inside .
Elphaba enters and is startled to find : The other Animals are gone-- the back window flung open .
Dillamond quickly shuts it , drawing the curtains .
ELPHABA Doctor Dillamond , what you were describing just now-- could something like that really happen ?
He regards her , his wise eyes grave .
DILLAMOND It is happening .
He removes his spectacles to clean them , drops them , rattled .
Elphaba picks them up , hands them to him .
Their eyes meet .
DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) If you make it discouraging enough , you can keep anyon e silent .
ELPHABA But , Doctor Dillamond , if Animals-- 44 DILLAMOND Shhh !
There &apos;s a SOUND-- is someone out there ?
Elphaba rushes to the window and peeks out : Sees nothing .
But Dillamond &apos;s nervous .
DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) You &apos;d better go .
He moves to the door .
She follows him , then-- ELPHABA If Animals are losing the ability to speak-- leaving Oz-- someone &apos;s got to tell the Wizard .
DILLAMOND Listen to me .
You cannot tell another soul what you &apos;ve heard and seen here tonight !
ELPHABA But-- that &apos;s why we have a Wizard !
( sings softly ) SO NOTHING BAD He looks at her .
And actually appears to be considering this .
Or is he just trying to mollify her-- ?
DILLAMOND Perhaps you &apos;re right .
BOTH NOTHING ALL THAT BAD NOTHING TRULY-- DILLAMOND ( suddenly BLEATS ) BAAAAAD .
They &apos;re both completely unnerved by this frightening , unfamiliar sound .
The Goat CLEARS HIS THROAT , tries to cover-- DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) Sorry .
I must be-- catching a cold .
She nods , troubled .
He opens the door , she starts out , turns back ; something makes her say ... ELPHABA Oz bless you , Doctor Dillamond .
He abruptly shuts the door .
45 OUTSIDE , ELPHABA STANDS THERE , her head reeling with everything she &apos;s witnessed , she SINGS SOFTLY TO HERSELF ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) IT COULDN &apos;T HAPPEN HERE IN OZ .... 39 39 EXT .
OUTSKIRTS OF SHIZ CAMPUS - NIGHT As Elphaba heads back towards her dorm , THE WIND PICKS UP AROUND HER .
Spooked , she glances around-- is she being followed ?
She listens .
Is that someone WHISPERING , or just the leaves ?
Suddenly-- HOOF BEATS !
She looks up-- A powerful multicolored HORSE is galloping straight towards her , about to trample her !
Elphaba leaps out of the way , stumbles , falls into a thicket-- The Horse stops short , turns to his rider , a strikingly beautiful young man in casual ( yet princely ) attire : FIYERO TIGELAAR .
HORSE ( to Fiyero ) I didn &apos;t see her !
FIYERO Nor did I-- Fiyero dismounts , goes to Elphaba-- FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) I &apos;m sorry , Miss , we didn &apos;t-- She looks up , the moonlight hits her face , he &apos;s taken aback by the green-- but not judgmental .
He holds out his hand-- FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) --see you .
You must &apos;ve-- blended in with the foliage .
S he scrambles to her feet , leaving his hand untouched , brushes herself off , as , to cover her self-consciousness-- ELPHABA Is this how you go through life , running amok , nearly trampling anyone in your path ?
FIYERO Well , sometimes I &apos;m asleep .
He studies her .
