KIAMO KO CASTLE - PARAPET - PRE-DAWN A SHIMMERING , MYSTERIOUS ORB comes into view .
As we look closer , it reveals itself to be-- a drop of water .
More drops appear , they-- float up , and that &apos;s when we realize : we &apos;ve been looking at this upside down ... We follow these drops , right side up now , to A STREAM OF WATER , flowing from the next room .
We follow this stream THROUGH the open doorway , where : ... it &apos;s eerily silent .
We pass clues : a bucket on its side , a slowly spreading puddle of water , some blue feathers , a soaked black cloak and ... A POINTED BLACK HAT .
Suddenly , something bursts from the shadows , into the sky-- IT &apos;S A SWARM OF WINGED MONKEYS .
The orchestral opening of &quot; No One Mourns The Wicked &quot; begins .
2 2 EXT .
KIAMO KO CASTLE - PRE-DAWN WE FOLLOW THE FLYING MONKEYS as they soar over FOUR FIGURES , below , crossing a drawbridge out of the castle .
One of them is waving something ... a broomstick ?
The first rays of the sun hit a waterfall , creating a rainbow .
We move over it , and travel along the ground , as ... A HORSE , ridden by a cloaked figure , gallops past-- SMASH CUT TO : 3 3 EXT .
MUNCHKINLAND - TULIP FIELDS - MORNING And CHILDREN charge , excitedly , through a nearby field-- LITTLE OZIAN BOY Good news !
She &apos;s dead !
LITTLE OZIAN GIRL It &apos;s the Witch Hunters !
LITTLE OZIAN BOY They got her Broomstick !

MUNCHKINLAND - TOWN CENTER - MORNING AN OZIAN FAMILY scrambles out of their front door , to find their NEIGHBORS , who turn to them , over-the-moon-- NEIGHBORS GOOD NEWS !
SHE &apos;S DEAD !
All around , MORE OZIANS emerge from their homes-- they hug , CLANG POTS AND PANS , SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS : OZIANS THE WITCH OF THE WEST IS DEAD !
PEOPLE pour out into the streets , emotional ; exultant-- OZIANS ( CONT &apos;D ) THE WICKEDEST WITCH THERE EVER WAS THE ENEMY OF ALL O F US HERE IN OZ IS DEAD !

One LITTLE GIRL &apos;s eyes widen : there &apos;s a LARGE BUBBLE , floating in front of her-- she pops it !
And then we see : MORE BUBBLES , floating down from above-- MAN IN THE CROWD Look !
It &apos;s Glinda !
The crowd looks to where he &apos;s pointing ... And rising in the North , we see : glowing , backlit against an impossibly beautiful , rainbow-colored sky ... GLINDA , the good witch , t he best witch of all , floating high above the crowd , in her very own flying Bubble-- VARIOUS OZIANS It &apos;s her ! / It &apos;s Glinda ! / The Witch of the North ! / It &apos;s Glinda the Good !
FROM THE CROWD &apos;S POV : Glinda looks down at them adoringly .
The Bubble &quot; lands &quot; .
Inside , Glinda raises her wand , as if to work some magic ... and then PLINK !
She taps the Bubble with her wand and pops it .
The crowd CHEERS !
As Glinda steps forward , radiating goodness , she smiles her irresistible smile-- 3 GLINDA It &apos;s good to see me , isn &apos;t it ?
( the thrilled crowd is speechless ) No need to respond-- that was rhetorical .
Fellow Ozians ... ( singing ) LET US BE GLAD LET US BE GRATEFUL LET US REJOICIFY THAT GOODNESS COULD SUBDUE THE WICKED WORKINGS OF YOU-KNOW-WHO ISN &apos;T IT NICE TO KNOW THAT GOOD WILL CONQUER EVIL ?
THE TRUTH WE ALL BELIEVE &apos;LL BY AND BY OUTLIVE A LIE FOR YOU AND ...
SOMEONE IN CROWD Glinda !
Exactly how dea d is she ?

ANGLE ON : A Messenger taps Glinda &apos;s proclamation into an Ozian-style telegraph machine as-- GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) The liquidation occurred at the thirteenth hour , the direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child .
Yes , the Wicked Witch of the West ... is dead .
The crowd EXPLODES : embracing , dancing , CELEBRATING ... !
MAN IN THE CROWD NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED WOMAN IN THE CROWD NO ONE CRIES : &quot; THEY WON &apos;T RETURN ! &quot;
ALL NO ONE LAYS A LILY ON THEIR GRAVE 5 5 EXT .
MUNCHKINLAND - FIELD The news travels beyond the town to PEOPLE at work in the fields-- MAN THE GOOD MAN SCORNS THE WICKED !

MUNCHKINLAND - TOWN CENTER GLINDA AND GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED &apos;S LIVES ARE LONELY GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED DIE ALONE IT JUST SHOWS WHEN YOU &apos;RE WICKED YOU &apos;RE LEFT ONLY ON YOUR OWN ...
The townspeople gather around Glinda .
TOWNSPEOPLE YES , GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED &apos;S LIVES ARE LONELY GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED CRY ALONE NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED THEY REAP ONLY WHAT THEY &apos;VE SOWN ... A GIRL IN THE CROWD calls out to Glinda-- GIRL IN THE CROW D But Miss Glinda , why does Wickedness happen ?
GLINDA That &apos;s a good question .
One that many people find confusifying : Are people born Wicked ?
Or do they have Wickedness thrust upon them ?
After all , she had a childhood .
She had a father , who , by the way , had been appointed the Governor of Munchkinland ... 7-10 7-10 OMITTED 11 11 INT .
GOVERNOR &apos;S MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT &#91; FLASHBACK &#93; GOVERNOR THROPP , a somber looking man in a suit , calls out-- GOVERNOR THROPP I &apos;m off to the Assembly , dear !
5 His voice ECHOES in the large , ornate house .
GLINDA ( V.O. )
And she had a mother .
As so many do ... A hauntingly beautiful woman appears beside Governor Thropp .
This is his wife-- MRS. THROPP .
GOVERNOR THROPP HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY MRS. THROPP THAT &apos;S ALRIGHT -- IT &apos;S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT GOVERNOR THROPP BUT KNOW THAT YOU &apos;RE HERE IN MY HEART WHILE I &apos;M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT ... GLINDA ( V.O. )
Like every fa mily ... they had their secrets .
Governor Thropp kisses his wife goodbye .
She shuts the front door behind him .
Her expression changes .
She turns , we FOLLOW HER through the house ... Down the hall ... To the back door , where she pulls HER LOVER inside .
The Lover ( who we only see from behind or in shadows ) takes a swig from a small green bottle , then offers it to her-- THE LOVER HAVE ANOTHER DRINK , MY DARK-EYED BEAUTY I &apos;VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT , HERE IN TOWN SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXIR AND WE &apos;LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW , LITTLE LADY , AND FOLLOW ME DOWN ...
They kiss-- the bottle slips from her hand .
As she pulls him up the stairs , WE LINGER ON THE GREEN BOTTLE , lying there ... GLINDA ( V.O. )
And one thing led to another ... as it so often does .
12-14 12-14 OMITTED 15 15 INT .
GOVERNOR &apos;S MANSION - HALLWAY &amp; BEDROOM - DAY CLOSE ON : Mrs. Thropp grabbing the bedsheets ... 6 GLINDA ( V.O. )
But from the moment the witch was born she was ... well , different .
CLOSE ON : ENORMOUS BEAR PAWS , RUNNING .
Is someone being attacked ?
But then , the bear paws run ... up a staircase .
DULCIBEAR ( PRE-LAP ) IT &apos;S COMING ... 16 16 INT .
GOVERNOR &apos;S MANSION - BEDROOM - DAY &#91; 9 MONTHS LATER &#93; The bear opens the door , carrying a cauldron and wearing a nursemaid &apos;s uniform .
This is DULCIBEAR .
GOVERNOR THROPP NOW ?
We hear a SCREAM and REVEAL Mrs. Thropp is in labor .
DULCIBEAR THE BABY &apos;S COMING ...
GOVERNOR THROPP AND HOW !
Governor Thropp dabs his wife &apos;s brow lovingly as Dulcibear pours boiling water over some towels and hands one to-- A FEMALE WOLF DOCTOR .
The Wolf Doctor holds an Ozian stethosco pe to Mrs. Thropp &apos;s pregnant belly .
WOLF DOCTOR I SEE A NOSE ...
GOVERNOR THROPP I SEE A CURL ... DULCIBEAR / GOVERNOR THROPP IT &apos;S A HEALTHY PERFECT LOVELY LITTLE ... DULCIBEAR Ohhhhh !
GOVERNOR THROPP Sweet Oz !
MRS. THROPP What is it , what &apos;s wrong ?
Governor Thropp stares at the baby in shocked disbelief .
DULCIBEAR HOW CAN IT BE ?
7 GOVERNOR THROPP WHAT DOES IT MEAN ?
DULCIBEAR IT &apos;S UNCANNY !
GOVERNOR THROPP ( devastated ) IT &apos;S OBSCENE !
GOVERNOR THROPP / WOLF DOCTOR LIKE A FROGGY , FERNY CABBAGE THE BABY IS UNNATURALLY ...
Governor Thropp looks from the baby to his wife , hurt and betrayed .
GOVERNOR THROPP ( a hushed accusation ) GREEN .
As Mrs. Thropp sees her BABY , we REVEAL : the baby is green .
Dulcibear picks up the baby and swaddles it lovingly .
She goes to hand the baby to Mrs. Thropp when-- GOVERNOR THROPP ( CONT &apos;D ) Take it away .
Dulcibear hesitates .
Suddenly the green baby lets out a WAIL , and-- BAM !
All the objects in the room fly into the air and stick to the ceiling and walls , as if gravity has pulled them in all directions .
Everyone looks around , stunned .
Governor Thropp stares at the green baby , clearly the source of this perversion of physics .
GOVERNOR THROPP ( CONT &apos;D ) Take it away-- !
Dulcibear hurries out with the baby , cradling it protectively in her arms .
The baby calms .
As they exit , we glimpse : the objects in the room behind them tumble back to earth .
TRANSITION : CLOSE ON a pop-up book , held by a pair of small green hands .
17 17 EXT .
GOVERNOR &apos;S MANSION - FRONT LAWN - DAY &#91; FLASHBACK &#93; FIND LITTLE ELPHABA ( 7 ) reading her book on the lawn .
Next to her , Dulcibear plays peekaboo with TODDLER NESSAROSE , &quot; NESSA &quot; , ( Elphaba &apos;s 4 year old sister , with eyes that could melt your heart .
She &apos;s in an Ozian-style wheelchair ) .
8 GOVERNOR THROPP ( O.S. )
Dulcibear !
Across the lawn , DIGNITARIES arrive , greeting the Governor .
DULCIBEAR Coming , Governor !
( to Elphaba ) Little One-- Little Elphaba looks up from her book-- DULCIBEAR ( CONT &apos;D ) Watch baby Nessa just a clock tick-- As Dulcibear lumbers off to assist the Governor , we hear : TAUNTING KIDS ( O.S. )
Yeah , watch your sister , El-pha-ba !
Little Elphaba looks over to the gate to the lawn , where so me MEAN KIDS have gathered-- MEAN KID Just don &apos;t let her see how ugly you are !
The Kids LAUGH .
Elphaba yells back , like it &apos;s a great burn-- LITTLE ELPHABA She already knows !
Confident she got the last word , Little Elphaba turns to her baby sister ... whose big eyes now look frightened-- LITTLE ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Oh , Nessarose , don &apos;t you worry-- ( whispers ) I &apos;m right here .
I always will be .
Elphaba takes Nessa &apos;s t iny hand into her own green hand , looks into her eyes , smiles .
Comforted , Nessa smiles back .
LITTLE ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Now .
You want to see something wonderful ... ?
( opening her pop-up book ) This is all about the Wizard .
Do you know how he got here ?
Toddler Nessa shakes her head no , eyes wide-- LITTLE ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) From the sky !
In a balloon !
See ?
9 We see a pop-up balloon , as Little Elphaba continues ... LITTLE ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Then he built a city made of emeralds , `cause he loves emeralds .
Even though they &apos;re green .
And Nessa , if you get to meet him ?
( whispers ) He grants your heart &apos;s desire !
PING !
A single pebble hits the pop up book-- when Elphaba turns to where it came from , WE HEAR the Kids , chanting-- KIDS Elphaba Thropp , green on top .
Someone run and tell her That everyon e can smell her ...
The kids throw more pebbles .
Toddler Nessa BURSTS INTO TEARS .
Little Elphaba leaps to her feet , glaring at the Kids , and suddenly-- the pebbles and dirt swirl up from the ground and pummel the shocked kids .
They SCREAM and run away .
GOVERNOR THROPP ( O.S. )
What have you done this time ? !
Elphaba turns to see her father rush over with Dulcibear .
GOVERNOR THROPP ( CONT &apos;D ) ( to Elphaba ) Now you &apos;ve made your sister cry !
He scoops up Toddler Nessa , and carries her off .
Elphaba looks down at her pop-up book in the dirt .
Dulcibear picks it up and dusts it off , giving it back to her tenderly .
Elphaba opens it and a pop-up Wizard comes out of his palace , smiling , his little pop-up hand reaching out ... to her .
GLINDA ( PRE-LAP ) So you see ... it couldn &apos;t have been easy .
18 18 EXT .
MUNCHKINLAND - TOWN CENTER - MORNING The crowd parts , making way for a HUGE EFFIGY OF ELPHABA .
It &apos;s wheeled towards Glinda , bearing down on her ...
CROWD NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED NOW AT LAST , SHE &apos;S DEAD AND GONE An OZIAN ZEALOT lights a stick and hands it to Glinda to do the honors .
10 Glinda &apos;s smile tightens for a split second , but then ... she lights the EFFIGY , which ignites in a WHOOSH of flames !
CROWD ( CONT &apos;D ) GLINDA ( concerned ) NOW AT LAST THERE &apos;S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND GOODNESS KNOWS ... AND GOODNESS KNOWS ... WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS AHH GOODNESS KNOWS ...
THE WICKED DIE ALONE ... SHE DIED ALONE ... WOE TO THOSE ( WOE TO THOSE ) WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN ... NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED !
GOOD NEWS !
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED !
GOOD NEWS !
NO ONE MOURNS THE ... ALL WICKED !
WICKED !
WICKED !
A beat .
Glinda turns away from the burning effigy .
GLINDA Well .
As you can imagine , I have much to attend to , what with the Wizard &apos;s unexpected departure , so-- Glinda steps back onto the Bubble &apos;s platform , and now we see that it is a bubble-powered machine : mechanical , not magical .
GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) If there are no further q uestions-- The Bubble &quot; rebubbles &quot; itself over her with a quick swoop .
Glinda is about to float away when suddenly A VOICE IN THE CROWD yells out-- VOICE IN THE CROWD Glinda !
Is it true you were her friend ?
Glinda freezes , thrown .
From inside her Bubble , Glinda stares at the burning effigy .
For a moment , the flames take her to a memory ... a feeling ... -- QUICK FLASH TO : A younger Glinda sits , arm in arm , with someone dressed in black , with black hair , whose face we can &apos;t see .
11 There &apos;s no sound but the CRACKLE and POP of a fire in a fireplace .
Glinda laughs until she cries , then-- leans closer to this person , and whispers something .
BACK TO SCENE : Glinda stares into the burning effigy then turns back to the crowd-- GLINDA Friend ?
I mean ...
I knew her .
RIPPLES OF SHOCK move through the Crowd below ... GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) That is , our paths did cross .
At school ...
But you must understand , it was ... a long time ago ... OFF Glinda , remembering ... and suddenly , we &apos;re on a boat , with her , traveling down a RIVER , towards : 18A 18A EXT .
SHIZ UNIVERSITY - RIVER ARCH The breathtaking arched gateway to Shiz University .
We hear the OPENING CHORDS the Shiz University Oz-ma Mater .
SONG : &quot; DEAR OLD SHIZ &quot; - INSTRUMENTAL INTRO 19 19 EXT .
SHIZ UNIVERSITY - ENTRANCE COURTYARD - DAY Pink suitcases of every size and shape hit the ground , as Glinda ( or as she was known back then , &quot; GALINDA &quot; ) strides through the impressive gates , clad in a Shiz University blazer , that she has styled in her own fashion forward , Galinda way .
She &apos;s flanked by her ADORING PARENTS .
As Galinda strides by , VARIOUS STUDENTS and PARENTS , notice her , thinking they know her-- or just wanting to .
They smil e as she passes , and Galinda ( being Galinda ) smiles back , waving , used to this ... Galinda stops and turns to her parents , flinging open her arms and pulling them into a hug .
After a long beat , she gently extricates herself .
As her tearful parents reluctantly start to go , she calls out-- GALINDA Remember , it &apos;s not goodbye , it &apos;s farewell .
Her Parents immediately rush back , clinging to her again .
This time she &apos;s getting squished , and over it ... 12 GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Now it &apos;s goodbye .
Her parents nod , and with one last kiss , they back away-- GALINDA &apos;S PARENTS Goodbye , precious ! / We love you !
Glinda notices : a handkerchief , floating beside her ?
She turns , puzzled , and sees ... AN EARNEST YOUNG MUNCHKIN STUDENT , ( BOQ ) offering it to her .
She takes it , dabs her eyes ... GALINDA ( to Boq , genuine ) They &apos;re going to miss me so much .
BOQ ( overcomes his shyness ) I &apos;m Boq .
From Munchkinland .
And I know we don &apos;t know each other , but-- GALINDA You know what I believe , Bick ?
BOQ Boq .
I mean-- what .
GALINDA That strangers ... are just people I &apos;ve never met .
He takes this in , slightly stumped , but she &apos;s looking into his eyes , and he &apos;s blown away , about to say more , when-- PFANNEE / SHENSHEN ( O.S. )
GALINDA ! !
Two excited students , PFANNEE and SHENSHEN , rush up to Galinda .
PFANNEE It &apos;s Pfannee !
SHENSHEN And ShenShen !
PFANNEE From Miss Cringeable &apos;s Twirling Academy !
SHENSHEN Do you remember us ?
13 Galinda clearly doesn &apos;t , but-- GALINDA Of course !
Boq watches , smitten , as Galinda chats with them , then moves toward the STUDENT CHOIR , conducted by the Head Shizstress , MISS CODDLE .
Pfannee and ShenShen follow Galinda ... STUDENT CHOIR O HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE-DRAPED WALLS ... Just then , a BOAT pulls up , unnoticed by them .
It briefly obscures our view of Galinda-- STUDENT CHOIR ( CONT &apos;D ) THE PROUDLIEST SIGHT TH ERE IS A BLACK BOOT steps out and plants itself on the ground .
Then another beside it .
STUDENT CHOIR ( CONT &apos;D ) WHEN GREY AND SERE OUR HAIR HATH TURNED We don &apos;t see who the boots belong to yet .
We &apos;re behind this figure .
A thick braid obscures her neck .
Her hands are shoved in her pockets .
A jacket ( not a Shiz blazer ) and tights cover her arms and legs .
STUDENT CHOIR ( CONT &apos;D ) WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED Stil l behind the figure , we move toward the choir with Galinda and her new friends ...
The figure reaches a green hand up and slowly pulls her braid aside , revealing her green neck .
A FEW STUDENTS notice and gawk .
One drops his suitcase .
STUDENT CHOIR ( CONT &apos;D ) IN OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZ Galinda moves closer to the choir , assuming the whispers and pointing are a response to her Galinda-ness .
STUDENT CHOIR ( CONT &apos;D ) ( not icing the mysterious figure ) OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZZZZ ...
The Choir trails off .
Galinda eagerly fills in for them-- GALINDA OH-OH-OH-OH-OLD ... 14 Mid-VOCALIZING , we watch it dawn on Galinda that everyone around her is staring , slack-jawed , just past her .
She spins around and-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) AHHH ! ! !
Galinda YELPS as she sees the figure in all her green glory .
And so do we .
This is ELPHABA ( 20s , badass .
Her razor sharp mind and tongue serve as armor , to protect her tender soul from moments like these ) .
Galinda stares at her .
Elphaba stares back defiantly .
ELPHABA What ?
What are you staring at ?
Oh-- do I have something in my teeth ?
Galinda is silent , flummoxed by this confrontation .
GALINDA But ... you &apos;re ... green .
ELPHABA I am ?
Elphaba looks around , as if to confirm this .
E LPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Fine .
Let &apos;s get this over with-- ( addressing them all ) No , I &apos;m not seasick ; yes , I &apos;ve always been green ; no , I didn &apos;t eat grass as a child .
Galinda feels everyone watching , musters up her best self-- GALINDA Well , I for one am so sorry that you &apos;re forced to live with-- ( gestures ) This-- ELPHABA Is that so ?
GALINDA Yes , and it &apos;s my intention to major in sorcery , so-- if at some future time you wanted to-- address the problem ?
Perhaps I could-- help .
15 ELPHABA Offering to help someone you don &apos;t know with a skill you don &apos;t have .
I &apos;m sure everyone &apos;s duly impressed .
Galinda , proudly virtuous , makes sure all can hear-- GALINDA I could care less what other people think .
ELPHABA Couldn &apos;t .
GALINDA What ?
ELPHABA You &quot; couldn &apos;t &quot; care less what other people think .
( looks her up and down ) Though I doubt that &apos;s true .
A ripple of tension courses through the crowd , when- - GOVERNOR THROPP ( O.S. )
Elphaba-- !
Governor Thropp appears , with NESSA .
Now also in her 20 &apos;s ; Nessa is beautiful , seemingly shy compared to Elphaba , but with her own brand of inner fierceness .
ELPHABA Oh , and this is my younger sister , Nessarose-- as you can see , she &apos;s a perfectly acceptable color-- As Nessa , embarrassed , tries to disappear , Thropp yanks Elphaba aside , hisses in her ear-- GOVERNOR TH ROPP ( O.S. )
Stop making a spectracle of yourself !
Governor Thropp presents a gift-wrapped bundle to Nessa-- GOVERNOR THROPP ( CONT &apos;D ) My precious little girl-- a parting gift .
NESSA Father-- !
16 With a self-conscious glance at Elphaba , Nessa opens the gift , revealing ... NESSA ( CONT &apos;D ) Jeweled shoes ?
GOVERNOR THROPP So they &apos;ll all see how beautiful you are-- right down to your toes .
Elphaba comes close , as Nessa takes her old shoes off and puts the jeweled ones on , Elphaba whispers to her , contrite .
ELPHABA I shouldn &apos;t have sprouted off like that .
NESSA ( a gentle reproof ) No , you shouldn &apos;t have .
Today is -- ( she breaks off ) ELPHABA The start of your new life .
The sisters regard each other-- they &apos;ve never been apart before .
Saying goodbye is hard ... for both of them .
NESSA I &apos;ll miss you .
Elphaba takes her younger sister &apos;s hand .
ELPHABA No you won &apos;t .
You &apos;ll be having too good a time .
TOWER BELLS RING .
All around them , Students bid goodbye to their loving families , and head for the Main Hall .
Governor Thropp reaches out for Nessa &apos;s chair , but-- ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) NESSA Don &apos;t help her-- Don &apos;t help me-- Nessa waves , and rolls away .
Elphaba , happiness for her sister mixed with a private ache , watches Nessa head off with the others .
Then-- Elphaba glances over at her father .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) She &apos;ll be fine .
GOVERNOR THROPP Go with her .
17 ELPHABA What ?
GOVERNOR THROPP Just until she &apos;s safely settled in her room .
Make sure she has everything she needs .
ELPHABA Father , she &apos;s on her own now , I can &apos;t just-- GOVERNOR THROPP Stop jabbering and do as I say !
Elphaba is startled-- not by his harshness , she &apos;s used to that .
By the tears in his eyes .
He lowers his voice .
GOVERNOR THROPP ( CONT &apos;D ) Please .
If anything should happen to her-- She can &apos;t refuse .
20-21 20-21 OM ITTED 22 22 EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD Elphaba approaches the impressive quad , pausing to admire : an archway carved with a striking fresco depicting historical Ozian Animals .
Then , above this , she spots-- A CARVING OF THE WIZARD .
Elphaba stares up at it , in awe .
His carved arm is outstretched , as if reaching out to her ... She steps through the archway to find-- The SHIZ PRESIDENT , at a podium , surrounded by seated ( human ) FACULTY MEMB ERS .
A well-dressed SHOEBILL-BIRD and a distinguished-looking , bespectacled Goat , DOCTOR DILLAMOND , the only Animal faculty members , are positioned at the edge of the platform , a slight distance from the others .
SHIZ PRESIDENT ... and rounding out the rest of our faculty , we have two scholars , eminent in their respective fields of Forestry and Agriculture ... TWO HUMAN PROFESSORS stand , to POLITE APPL AUSE .
IN THE AUDIENCE : Among the STUDENTS , we find Nessa , in one of the aisles .
Boq is seated not far behind her and nearby , Galinda sits with Pfannee and ShenShen .
18 IN THE BACK OF THE QUAD : Elphaba enters quietly , unnoticed ... SHIZ PRESIDENT ( CONT &apos;D ) As well as Professor Mombi , of the Biological Arts ... And of course , the head of our History department , Doctor Dillamond .
Mombi , the Bird , and Doctor Dillamond , the Goat , step forward .
But-- there &apos;s no applause .
IN THE BACK OF THE QUAD , Elphaba takes this in , as UP AT THE PODIUM : The President CLEARS HIS THROAT ... SHIZ PRESIDENT ( CONT &apos;D ) Finally ...
In today &apos;s Oz , a real sorceress , one who possesses true magic , has become all too rare ... A ripple of excitement spreads across the room .
Galinda sits up straighter , in anticipation .
SHIZ PRESIDENT ( CONT &apos;D ) Which is why we are so privileged to have , here at Shiz , our esteemed Professor Emeritus and Dean of Sorcery Studies ... Madame Morrible .
EXCITED APPLAUSE .
Everyone leaps to their feet , as-- An elegant woman appears in the back of the hall , charisma radiating from her like a magnetic charge .
This is MADAME MORRIBLE .
As she makes her way down the aisle and up the steps of the platform , all eyes are on her .
Nessa , her view now blocked by everyone standing up , cranes to ge t a glimpse of Morrible .
Her eyes meet Boq &apos;s , also struggling to see .
They share a wry smile ... Galinda stares , starstruck , at Madame Morrible .
GALINDA It &apos;s really her !
( whispers to her friends ) Madame Morrible is why I applied to Shiz !
They say she &apos;s been looking for someone to mentorize , and it &apos;s my dream to someday fill her shoes !
( clocking her shoes ) Which are amazing .
Morrible , now at the podium , looks out at the students .
19 MORRIBLE Welcome new students .
And congratulotions , on having been accepted to Shiz .
Whether you &apos;ll be studying Law , Logic , or Linguification , I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say that we have nothing but the highest hopes .
For some of you .
Galinda perks up , positive Morrible is speaking only of her .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) And now-- Miss Coddle , if you please ...
The perennially anxious Miss Coddl e steps up to the podium-- MISS CODDLE I am Miss Coddle , Head Shizstress .
And these are your dormitory designations and room assignments !
Miss Coddle signals , and five ASSISTANTS appear at the sides of the room , holding ornate poles with scrolls attached to the top .
In unison , they pull a ribbon-- scrolls unfurl , revealing the room assignments .
BUZZING excitedly , the Students rush to locate themselve s on the lists .
All except Galinda , who ( tailed by Pfannee and ShenShen ) moves purposefully toward Madame Morrible .
GALINDA Madame Morrible ? !
Morrible , steps down from the platform and sees-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) I am Galinda Upland .
Of the Upper Uplands ?
MORRIBLE If this is regarding room assignments-- GALINDA Oh , no ...
Thank you so much for asking , but I &apos;ve already been assigned a private suite .
Then , realiz ing that Pfannee and ShenShen are listening-- 20 GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) But you can of course come visit me whenever you want !
Impressed by her generosity , they murmur to each other-- SHENSHEN PFANNEE Awww ! !
She &apos;s so good !
PFANNEE ( CONT &apos;D ) ( to Galinda ) You &apos;re so good !
Morrible , unimpressed , heads for the exit .
Undauntable , Galinda follows determinedly after her-- GALINDA No , it &apos;s about my application to your sorcery seminar !
MORRIBLE I do not teach my seminar every semester .
Of course , if someone very special were to come along--- Morrible starts to walk away from Galinda .
GALINDA Well , naturally !
Which is why I wanted to talk to you ...
But Morrible just keeps walking .
Galinda frowns at Pfannee and ShenShen , frustrated , as ... BY THE LAST ROOM ASSIGNMENT SCROLL : Nessa is searching for her name , when-- MISS CODDLE There you are !
Miss Nessarose , isn &apos;t it ?
The Governor &apos;s daughter ?
( taking Nessa in ) How tragically beautiful you are .
It &apos;s an honor to-- AHHH !
Miss Coddle involuntarily yelps , startled by the sight of Elphaba , who has just appeared .
Hearing this yelp , Morrible turns and observes , as-- ELPHABA I &apos;m the other daughter .
I &apos;m beautifully tragic .
21 NESSA Elphaba-- ?
MISS CODDLE ( rattled ) The other daughter ?
I wasn &apos;t-- made aware , but-- not to fret , just a slight gulch , we &apos;ll find someplace to hide you-- I mean house you !
ELPHABA No , I &apos;m not enrolled .
MISS CODDLE Oh good .
Though I &apos;m sure you &apos;re ... very bright .
Galinda overhears this , turns to Pfannee and ShenShen-- GALINDA Bright ?
She &apos;s phosphorescent !
Everyone LAUGHS , including Boq .
Elphaba hears them and her eyes flash with anger .
Nessa , embarrassed , whispers-- NESSA Why are you still here ?
ELPHABA Forgive me Nessa , Father insisted-- MISS CODDLE ( interrupts ) Oh , the Governor made his concern for your sister quite apparent-- Please assure him I &apos;m honored to help her .
Miss Coddle moves towards Nessa .
NESSA Wait , what ?
ELPHABA Oh , no , she doesn &apos;t need your help .
NESSA ( to Elphaba ) Or yours .
( to Coddle ) I just need to find my room .
MISS CODDLE I &apos;ll bring you there myself !
22 Miss Coddle takes hold of Nessa &apos;s chair-- NESSA No , I meant-- wait-- !
I can find my own way ...
But Miss Coddle starts to push Nessa &apos;s chair-- ELPHABA Miss Coddle-- no !
But Coddle keeps pushing .
Elphaba sees Nessa &apos;s distress ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Stop !
She doesn &apos;t need you to-- As Miss Coddle struggles to push Nessa &apos;s wheelchair-- it starts to move backwards , as if pulled by some unseen force .
Nessa sees light fixtures begin to bend off the wall .
Water from a nearby fountain starts to lean .
NESSA ( a frightened whisper ) Oh no !
Elphaba-- Miss Coddle struggles to lift her feet off the ground .
She &apos;s stuck , weighed down by a sudden , forceful gravity .
Pfannee and ShenShen clutch each other in fear but Galinda can &apos;t take her eyes off what &apos;s happening .
The chairs in the quad begin sliding towards Elphaba , whose anger mounts as Miss Coddle struggles , until-- ELPHABA LET .
HER .
GO ! !
Nessa &apos;s wheelchair breaks out of Miss Coddle &apos;s hands and rises into the air .
People watch in shock .
Elphaba &apos;s eyes are locked on Nessa .
The wheels of Nessa &apos;s chair begin to spin until they suddenly stop .
Nessa drops back down to earth .
Coddle can finally walk again-- her feet freed from the gravitational pull .
Elphaba grabs the wheelchair and helps pull it back down .
She EXHALES , Nessa is safe ... FROM HIGH ABOVE : we see Elphaba and Nessa at the center of the group of st unned students , the chairs of the quad piled up around them .
23 ON MORRIBLE : She &apos;s been observing all this closely ... NESSA ( devastated ) This was my chance .
My new start .
ELPHABA Oh Nessa-- I &apos;m so sorry-- The students who haven &apos;t fled now stare at Elphaba with shock and fear .
Morrible clocks this and quickly calls out-- MORRIBLE Magic is merely the mind &apos;s attempt to wrap itself around the impossible .
Yes : I did that ... ( everyone reacts ) ... to prepare you to expect th e unexpected here at Shiz .
The students regard Morrible with awe , and break into APPLAUSE , as Nessa and Elphaba share a private look of surprised relief .
Then Nessa heads out , on her own ... ON GALINDA : She &apos;s blown away-- GALINDA ( to Pfannee and ShenShen ) Did you visually see that ?
I simply must get into her seminar !
MORRIBLE And speaking of the unexpected ... Morrible turns to Galinda and the other gi rls-- MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Which of you young ladies will volunteer to share with-- GALINDA ( calls out ) Madame Morrible-- ?
MORRIBLE Oh , thank you dear .
That is very good of you .
GALINDA Wait , what ?
MORRIBLE Miss-- Elphaba , is it-- ?
You can room with Miss Galinda !
24 ELPHABA What ? !
GALINDA But , Madame Morrible-- MORRIBLE Go now .
All of you .
The Students leave the quad .
Galinda stops , turning back to look again-- first at Morrible , then at Elphaba , because ... there must be some mistake ... and then she hears-- MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) You .
Come with me .
Galinda smiles , relieved and thrilled-- GALINDA Well , of course !
Galinda starts towards Morrible-- MORRIBLE No .
Not you .
( turns to Elphaba ) You .
Galinda stops short .
Both girls are deeply confused .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) ( to Elphaba ) I shall tutor you privately .
And take no other students .
Now come .
And with that , Morrible sweeps out the back exit .
Elphaba hesitates , then follows as Galinda stands there in shock .
23 23 EXT .
SHIZ - ENTRANCE COURTYARD - COLONNADE - DAY Morrible walks briskly , as Elphaba hurries to keep up .
ELPHABA Madame , thank you , for covering for me .
And I &apos;m-- humbled , by your munificent offer , but my father would never allow it !
MORRIBLE ( with utter assurance ) Just leave your father to me .
I shall speak to him post haste !
25 As Elphaba attempts to process all this-- Morrible stops , fixes Elphaba with a penetrating look .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) How long have you had this ... talent ?
ELPHABA Talent ?
No .
Something just-- comes over me , sometimes .
Something I can &apos;t control ... And when it does ... bad things happen .
MORRIBLE If you can learn to use your powers ... in the right way ... Morrible , deeply moved , regards her new student-- MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Oh , Miss Elphaba ... SONG : &quot; THE WIZARD AND I &quot; MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) MANY YEARS I HAVE WAITED FOR A GIFT LIKE YOURS TO APPEAR WHY I PREDICT THE WIZARD MIGHT MAKE YOU HIS MAGIC GRAND VIZIER ELPHABA The Wizard ! ?
MORRIBLE MY DEAR , MY DEAR I &apos;LL WRITE AT ONCE TO THE WIZARD TELL HIM OF YOU IN ADVANCE WITH A TALENT LIKE YOURS , DEAR THERE IS A DEFIN-ISH CHANCE IF YOU WORK AS YOU SHOULD YOU &apos;LL BE MAKING GOOD ... ( then ) Welcome to Shiz !
Morrible smiles , leaves her .
Elphaba is now al one-- and thunderstruck , trying to absorb what just transpired .
ELPHABA DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN ?
HAVE I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD ?
THIS WEIRD QUIRK I &apos;VE TRIED 26 TO SUPPRESS OR HIDE IS A TALENT THAT COULD HELP ME MEET THE WIZARD IF I MAKE GOOD SO I &apos;LL MAKE GOOD ... Elphaba hop stones across a rivulet , Frogs leaping off the stones as she lands on the other side ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) WHEN I MEET THE WIZARD ONCE I PROVE MY WORTH AND THEN I MEET THE WIZARD WHAT I &apos;VE WAITED FOR SINCE -- SINCE BIRTH !
She arrives at some steps , climbs them ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) AND WITH ALL HIS WIZARD WISDOM BY MY LOOKS , HE WON &apos;T BE BLINDED DO YOU THINK THE WIZARD IS DUMB ?
OR LIKE MUNCHKINS , SO SMALL-MINDED ?
NO !
She finds a bench at the top of the steps ... as Crickets jump out of her path ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) HE &apos;LL SAY TO ME : &quot; I SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE A GIRL ON WHOM I CAN RELY ! &quot;
AND THAT &apos;S HOW WE &apos;LL BEGIN THE WIZARD AND I ... She crosses into a garden in front of the library , alive with Ozian flowers swirling in the w ind ... 23A 23A EXT .
SHIZ - ENTRANCE COURTYARD - LIBRARY GARDEN - DAY ELPHABA ONCE I &apos;M WITH THE WIZARD MY WHOLE LIFE WILL CHANGE &apos; CUZ ONCE YOU &apos;RE WITH THE WIZARD NO ONE THINKS YOU &apos;RE STRANGE !
Bees fly out from among the flowers .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) NO FATHER IS NOT PROUD OF YOU NO SISTER ACTS ASHAMED AND ALL OF OZ HAS TO LOVE YOU WHEN BY THE WIZARD , YOU &apos;RE ACCLAIMED AND THIS GIFT -- OR THIS CURSE -- I HAVE INSIDE 27 MAYBE AT LAST , I &apos;LL KNOW WHY AS WE WORK HAND IN HAND THE WIZARD AND I !
AND ONE DAY , HE &apos;LL SAY TO ME : &quot; ELPHABA , A GIRL WHO IS SO SUPERIOR SHOULDN &apos;T A GIRL WHO &apos;S SO GOOD INSIDE HAVE A MATCHING EXTERIOR ?
AND SINCE FOLKS HERE TO AN ABSURD DEGREE SEEM FIXATED ON YOUR VERDIGRIS WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT BY YOU IF I DE-GREENIFY YOU ? &quot;
There &apos;s a kinetic wind-sculpture .
She sees her reflection in multiple colors .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) AND THOUGH OF COURSE THAT &apos;S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME &quot; ALL RIGHT , WHY NOT ? &quot;
I &apos;LL REPLY She joyfully spins the sculpture and the wind picks up .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) OH , WHAT A PAIR WE &apos;LL BE THE WIZARD AND I ... WHAT A PAIR WE &apos;LL BE THE WIZARD AND-- The wind picks up .
The flowers in the garden start to wave .
She comes to an ancient , giant Wisteria tree .
Elphaba hears ECHOES OF CHEERS from somewhere far off .
Sh e crosses under the hanging branches to find another , larger sculpture , this one of the Wizard &apos;s head .
She stares into the moving sculpture , almost trancelike .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) UNLIMITED MY FUTURE IS UNLIMITED AND I &apos;VE JUST HAD A VISION ALMOST LIKE A PROPHECY She heads behind the sculpture , towards the source of the wind , which now sounds like-- applause .
23B 23B EXT .
SHIZ - FIELD &amp; EDGE OF CLIFF - DAY ELPHABA I KNOW -- IT SOUNDS TRULY CRAZY AND TRUE , THE VISION &apos;S HAZY BUT I SWEAR , SOMEDAY THERE &apos;LL BE A CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT OZ 28 THAT &apos;S ALL TO DO-- WITH ME !
Elphaba crosses into an open field , the grass almost becoming the cheering crowd ...
Birds take flight around her .
Elphaba runs through this &quot; cheering crowd , &quot; drinking in this &quot; acclaim , &quot; this celebration happening ( in nature ) around her .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) AND I &apos;LL STAND THERE WITH THE WIZARD FEELING THINGS I &apos;VE NEVER FELT AND THOUGH I &apos;D NEVER SHOW IT I &apos;LL BE SO HAPPY , I COULD MELT AND SO IT WILL BE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AND I &apos;LL WANT NOTHING ELSE TILL I DIE HELD IN SUCH HIGH ESTEEM WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME , THEY WILL SCREAM FOR HALF OF OZ &apos;S FAV &apos;RITE TEAM : Elphaba looks into the distant horizon .
We see she &apos;s standing at the edge of a dramatic cliff overlooking waves that are made of not water but sand , moving with the wind .
This is the very edge of Oz .
She takes in the exhilarating sig ht .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) THE WIZARD-- AND I !
As Elphaba walks away , blowing leaves and flowers whip past her and fly off the edge of the cliff , fluttering down towards the sandy shore below .
23C 23C INT .
SHIZ - DORMITORY CORRIDOR - EVENING Elphaba looks around at the room numbers , looking for hers .
She spots the right door , lets herself in-- 24 24 INT .
SHIZ - THE GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - EVENING Elphaba &apos;s POV : Galinda .
The two girls regard each other warily , like two natural enemies in the wild .
Then Elphaba pushes brusquely past her into the room .
She surveys Galinda &apos;s fluffy possessions-- nearly everywhere .
ELPHABA Do you really think this is fair ?
GALINDA I do not , as I was promised a private suite .
But thanks for asking !
29 Elphaba moves toward Galinda , who backs away uneasily .
Elphaba moves past Galinda , towards the balcony door ... ELPHABA ( her patience fraying ) I &apos;m just shutting the door !
Galinda moves peremptorily to the door .
GALINDA Oh , do you mind leaving it open ?
I so enjoy ... air !
Galinda eyes Elphaba with carefully feigned casualness-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) I saved you some space , by the way .
Galinda gestures grandly to one c orner : where there &apos;s a diminutive daybed next to a tiny table with one drawer .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) ( as if she &apos;s been thanked ) It was nothing .
Roommates do these things for each other .
As Galinda continues , Elphaba goes to her bed .
Sits .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) For instance , and this is just an example , I could lend you some clothes , til your luggage arrives .
( Elphaba stares at her ) Since you &apos;ve-- nothing to wear .
ELPHABA ( jus t honest ) I &apos;ll have nothing to wear even after my luggage arrives .
GALINDA And in return , perhaps you could-- let &apos;s see-- put in a good word for me ?
With Madame Morrible ?
Deal ?
Elphaba decides to ignore this .
Galinda studies her .
Then-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) That was you .
Down there .
Who made all that happen .
Elphaba grows uncomfortable .
30 ELPHABA You heard Madame Morrible .
Galinda moves closer to Elphaba , fascinated .
GALINDA How did you do it ?
Tell me .
( Elphaba doesn &apos;t answer ) Please ?
I can keep a secret .
( still nothing ) Fine .
Be that way .
But it &apos;s a bit selfish on your part , I asked really nicely , plus , I saved you a drawer-- ELPHABA I don &apos;t know !
I &apos;VE NEVER KNOWN !
Suddenly the DOOR SLAMS SHUT , a pane of glass cracks , then shatters .
Gali nda stares at it , then-- at Elphaba .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) There .
A compromise .
25 25 EXT .
SHIZ - DORM - LATER THAT NIGHT All of the windows in the dorm go dark one by one as happy new ROOMMATES click off their lights for the night .
All but one .
In that last window , A PINK LIGHT GOES ON-- 26 26 INT .
SHIZ - GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - NIGHT By the glow of her pink Ozian lamp , Galinda writes at her bedside table .
She darts a glance over to : Elphaba &apos;s bed , then resumes writing , muttering-- GALINDA Dearest darlingest Momsie and Popsical ... And now we see , Elphaba too , is surreptitiously writing home ; also muttering to herself-- ELPHABA &quot; My dear Father ...
Thank you for agreeing to let me stay . &quot;
GALINDA &quot; Guess what ? &quot;
ELPHABA &quot; In regards t o your request that I move in with Nessa-- &quot; 31 GALINDA &quot; I can &apos;t hear your guesses because this is a letter . &quot;
ELPHABA &quot; I know she wouldn &apos;t want me to-- &quot; ( crosses that out ) &quot; I know how much she wants to be-- &quot; ( crosses that out ) GALINDA &quot; So I &apos;ll just tell you . &quot;
Both girls pause : how to phrase this-- ?
SONG : &quot; WHAT IS THIS FEELING ? &quot;
As both girls quietly , yet urgently , compose their letters ... ELPHABA / GALINDA THERE &apos;S BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER ROOMING HERE AT SHIZ ELPHABA BUT OF COURSE , I &apos;LL CARE FOR NESSA GALINDA BUT OF COURSE , I &apos;LL RISE ABOVE IT ELPHABA / GALINDA FOR I KNOW THAT &apos;S HOW YOU &apos;D WANT ME TO RESPOND YES , THERE &apos;S BEEN SOME CONFUSION FOR YOU SEE , MY ROOM-MATE IS ... GALINDA ( searches for words ) UNUSUALLY AND EXCEEDINGLY PECULIAR AND ALTOGETHER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE ... Elphaba , too , struggles to describe her roommate .
Finally : ELPHABA BLONDE .
Both girls sign their letters .
We see them from above , in their respective beds , unable to sleep .
Galinda , in a frilly pink nightie , turns off ( in Ozian manner ) her pink bedside night-lamp .
Elphaba , clad in worn underthings , punches her pillow .
Both girls suddenly fling off their cover s , as if hot-- 32 GALINDA WHAT IS THIS FEELING SO SUDDEN AND NEW ELPHABA I FELT THE MOMENT I LAID EYES ON YOU They toss and turn on their beds-- GALINDA MY PULSE IS RUSHING ... ELPHABA MY HEAD IS REELING .. GALINDA MY FACE IS FLUSHING ...
BOTH WHAT IS THIS FEELING ?
FERVID AS A FLAME DOES IT HAVE A NAME ?
Both sit up , experiencing a private , astounding revelation ...
BOTH ( CONT &apos;D ) YES !
LOATHING !
They rise , energized-- and come face to face i n the middle of the room-- what a relief to admit it !
BOTH ( CONT &apos;D ) UNADULTERATED LOATHING !
GALINDA FOR YOUR FACE ... ELPHABA YOUR VOICE ... GALINDA YOUR CLOTHING ... Each studies the other , marvels at the depth of revulsion-- BOTH LET &apos;S JUST SAY-- I LOATHE IT ALL !
Elphaba moves to Galinda &apos;s side and turns off the pink lamp .
Galinda is pissed .
This is war .
33 27 27 INT .
SHIZ - GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - MORNING Elphaba awakes to find herself surrounded by GALINDA &apos;S STUFF .
GALINDA EV &apos;RY LITTLE TRAIT , HOWEVER SMALL As Elphaba struggles to get through this pink barricade-- ELPHABA MAKES MY VERY FLESH BEGIN TO CRAWL BOTH WITH SIMPLE UTTER LOATHING Elphaba emerges disheveled and furious to find Galinda serenely putting the final touches on her perfect look-- BOTH ( CONT &apos;D ) THERE &apos;S A STRANGE EXHILARATION IN SUCH TOTAL DETE STATION IT &apos;S SO PURE !
SO STRONG !
Galinda exits with a smug smile-- 28 28 INT .
SHIZ - GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - LATER THAT DAY Galinda enters with Pfannee and ShenShen to find : HER PINK BELONGINGS now piled haphazardly on Galinda &apos;s side of the room .
Elphaba emerges from the balcony , smiles her own smug smile-- BOTH THOUGH I DO ADMIT IT CAME ON FAST STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN LAST AND I WILL BE LOATHING LOATHING YOU MY WHOLE LIFE LONG !
Elphaba exits , slamming the door , causing the pile of precious pink stuff to crash down and go everywhere-- Galinda &apos;s anger boils over into a scream , as we CUT TO : 29 29 EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD / JUST OUTSIDE DINING HALL - DAY Galinda confidently strides towards the dining hall , trailed by her many friends .
STUDENTS DEAR GALINDA YOU ARE JUST TOO GOOD HOW DO YOU STAND IT ?
I DON &apos;T THINK I COULD !
SHE &apos;S A TERROR !
SHE &apos;S A TARTAR !
34 WE DON &apos;T MEAN TO SHOW A BIAS BUT GALINDA , YOU &apos;RE A MARTYR !
GALINDA WELL-- Galinda stops at the entrance to the dining hall , turns back to her friends-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) THESE THINGS ARE SENT TO TRY US !
Galinda realizes they &apos;re all staring past her , through the glass .
She spins around , to see what they &apos;re staring at : GALINDA &apos;S POV : ELPHABA , in the dining hall .
As the Students enter the dining hall ... STUDENTS POO R GALINDA , FORCED TO RESIDE WITH SOMEONE SO DISGUSTIKAFIED WE JUST WANT TO TELL YOU : WE &apos;RE ALL ON YOUR SIDE !
30 30 INT .
DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS Elphaba looks up from getting her food , to find Galinda and company all staring coldly at her .
STUDENTS WE SHARE YOUR-- Elphaba tries to find a seat , but people keep sitting where she &apos;s about to sit .
STUDENTS ( CONT &apos;D ) GALINDA AND ELPHABA WHAT IS THIS FEELING ?
L OATHING SO SUDDEN AND NEW ?
UNADULTERATED LOATHING FOR I FELT THE MOMENT HER FACE , HER VOICE HER I LAID EYES ON YOU CLOTHING MY PULSE IS RUSHING LET &apos;S JUST SAY : MY HEAD IS REELING WE LOATHE IT ALL !
EV &apos;RY OH , WHAT IS THIS FEELING ?
LITTLE TRAIT HOWEVER SMALL DOES IT HAVE A NAME ?
YES ... MAKES OUR VERY FLESH BEGIN TO AHHH ...
CRAWL AHHH ... ALL AHHH-- !
Finally Elphaba , defiant , plunks herself down right opposite Galinda .
Galinda &apos;s pals , anticipating unpleasantness , take off , leaving the two roommates to deal with each other .
35 31 31 INT .
/ EXT - SHIZ CLASSROOM / SPORTS AREA ( INTERCUT ) GALINDA AND ELPHABA STUDENTS LOATHING THERE &apos;S A STRANGE LOATHING !
EXHILARATION LOATHING !
IN SUCH TOTAL DETESTATION LOATHING !
IT &apos;S SO PURE , SO STRONG !
SO STRONG !
ELPHABA / GALINDA THOUGH I DO ADMIT IT CAME ON FAST STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN LAST 32 32 EXT .
SHIZ CAMPUS - QUAD - DAY Galinda , along with virtually the entire student body , dances , claiming her victory-- GALINDA AND ELPHABA STUDENTS AND I WILL BE LOATHING FOR LOATHING FOREVER LOATHING TRULY , LOATHING DEEPLY LOATHING YOU LOATHING , LOATHING YOU !
MY WHOLE LIFE LONG !
Suddenly Galinda spots Elphaba , up above , at the entrance to Morrible &apos;s quarters , being greeted by Morrible-- STUDENTS ( CONT &apos;D ) LOATHING !
UNADULTERATED LOATHING !
33 33 INT .
SHIZ - GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - EVENING Galinda enters their room , relieved to find herself alone , until-- Elphaba pops out at her from the balcony-- ELPHABA Boo .
Galinda YELPS .
Elphaba CACKLES .
33A 33A EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD - EARLY MORNING Students rush across campus to get to class on time .
34 34 INT .
SHIZ - DR. DILLAMOND &apos;S CLASSROOM - DAY Elphaba enters the History class .
As Students , including Galinda , Pfannee , ShenShen , Boq and Nessa take their seats ... AVARIC ( attractive , bookish ) goes to take the open seat next to Nessa , but another STUDENT sits there first , as-- 36 DILLAMOND ( O.S. )
Settle down , ladies and gentlemen ; settle down now-- !
Doctor Dillamond enters ... DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) I have read your most recent essays , and I am amazed to report some progress .
Although some of us still tend to favor form over content-- ( hands Galinda her paper ) Miss Glllinda .
GALINDA It &apos;s Ga-linda .
With a &quot; Ga . &quot; DILLAMOND Yes , of course .
( he tries , but ... ) Glllinda .
GALINDA ( huffily ) I don &apos;t see what t he problem is-- every other professor manages to pronouncify my name .
ELPHABA Maybe the pronuncifi-cation of your precious name is not the sole focus of Doctor Dillamond &apos;s life .
Maybe he &apos;s not like every other Professor , maybe some of us are different !
Nessa shoots her sister a look : quiet !
GALINDA It seems the artichoke is steamed .
Everyone LAUGHS ; Boq LAUGHS a beat too long .
Nessa clocks Boq &apos;s amusem ent , starts to LAUGH with him , but then-- she sees Elphaba &apos;s hurt expression and quickly stops herself .
DILLAMOND We Goats lack upper front teeth .
Which accounts for the mispronunciation , Miss-- Glllinda .
37 Using an Ozian slide projector ( involving mirrors and sunlight coming through a hole in a window shade ) Dillamond shows them A SUCCESSION OF IMAGES : Animals , contributing to Ozian society , alongside humans .
On one slide , A FROG AND A RABBIT SCIENTIST , IN GOGGLES AND LAB COATS , CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENT .
In the last slide , we see A MUCH YOUNGER DILLAMOND , IN SHIZ HALL , LECTURING TO HUMAN AND ANIMAL STU DENTS-- as WE HEAR : DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) Some of us are different .
And there was a time , before you were born , when life in Oz was different .
When one could walk these halls , and hear-- a Snow Leopard , solving an equation , or an Antelope , explicating a sonnet .
So ... when , and why-- did this change ?
Elphaba raises her hand .
ELPHABA From what I &apos;ve read , it began with the Great Drought .
DILLAMOND Precisely .
Food gre w scarce .
When people are hungry , and-- angry , they begin to look for-- ELPHABA Someone to blame .
&#91; Alt : A scapegoat . &#93;
Elphaba &apos;s eyes meet Dillamond &apos;s .
Galinda raises her hand .
DILLAMOND Yes , Miss Gllll-- GALINDA It &apos;s GA-linda .
And why can &apos;t you just teach us history , instead of always harping on the past ?
Other students , except Elphaba , MURMUR their agreement .
DILLAMOND Because we cannot escape the past .
A nd we ignore it at our own peril .
The past helps explain our present circumstances .
For instance , if we examine this timeline-- 38 He flips the chalkboard over : The entire CLASS GASPS .
SCRAWLED IN BLOOD RED PAINT ACROSS DILLAMOND &apos;S TIMELINE : &quot; animals should be seen and not heard . &quot;
Dillamond , shaken , stares at the disturbing words .
Elphaba , horrified , looks from the words , to her teacher ... DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) Who is responsible for this ?
He waits .
Elphaba &apos;s anger grows as the shocked students look at each other , silent , uncomfortable ; until finally-- DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) Very well , class dismissed .
Elphaba looks like she &apos;s going to explode .
Seeing this , Nessa anxiously puts her hand on Elphaba-- when suddenly-- CRASH !
Everyone jumps !
Dillamond has backed into his desk , a vase holding an array of poppies has fallen-- and lies shattered on the floor .
DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) I said class dismissed !
The students scramble out of there , except for Elphaba .
She quietly gathers the poppies that fell from his desk .
ELPHABA Your lovely poppies !
Elphaba carefully gathers them up , sees a watering can , on his window le dge , places the poppies in it ... DILLAMOND ( still shaken ) Thank you , you &apos;re very kind .
( re : poppies ) They &apos;re my favorite .
They keep me cheerful ... in these dark times .
She glances again at those awful words on the board , as Dillamond opens a cupboard , takes out a little broom ... DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) Miss Elphaba-- please .
Go and join your friends ELPHABA It &apos;s alright , I have no friends .
He can &apos;t help but LAUGH .
Th en ... 39 DILLAMOND Well .
Maybe ... one .
He smiles .
She smiles back .
He starts to sweep up the broken glass as Elphaba walks past the blood red words ... and exits .
MORRIBLE ( PRE-LAP ) Try again .
35 35 INT .
SHIZ - MORRIBLE &apos;S QUARTERS - DAY Elphaba stands in front of a table with an Ozian coin placed on it .
Morrible , nearby , provides quiet guidance ... MORRIBLE Eyes shut .
Toes clenched .
Are your toes clenched ?
ELPHABA I-- think so .
MORRIBLE And picture it .
Are you picturing ?
Elphaba nods ... eyes shut ... clenching ... picturing ... MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Now ... levitate the coin .
Elphaba takes a deep breath ... tries .
Then-- opens her eyes : The coin hasn &apos;t b udged .
Elphaba slams the table with her fist in frustration .
Morrible grabs her hand , concerned , motherly .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) I hear there was an unfortunate disturbance in Doctor Dillamond &apos;s class today .
That must have been distressful for you .
Elphaba nods , relieved : she understands .
ELPHABA Someone wrote those horrendible words , on purpose , for him to see-- I just wish-- She breaks off , pacing now , fists clenched , rage building-- MORRIBLE ( egging her on ) What .
You wish-- what ?
40 ELPHABA That there was something I could do !
Because no one should be-- Elphaba breaks off , stares at the coin , like she &apos;s thinking-- if only I could levitate that , maybe I could do something .
MORRIBLE No one should be what ?
ELPHABA Scorned , or laughed at , or looked down upon , or told to stop jabbering AND KEEP QUIET !
The coin suddenly FLIES from the table at high speed , like a BULLET , smashing into the mirror on Morrible &apos;s mantle .
Madame Morrible stares at her with admiration .
Even ... awe .
MORRIBLE Remarkable .
Absolutely remarkable .
Elphaba stares at the shattered glass , shocked .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Once you learn to harness your emotions ... the sky &apos;s the limit .
Elphaba absorbs this .
Inspired by it .
36 36 EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD - DUSK Elphaba exits Morrible &apos;s quarters , lost in thought , heading back to her dorm when she catches sight of : Doctor Dillamond , hurriedly crossing the quad .
ELPHABA Doctor Dillamond !
Did you find out who-- But he either doesn &apos;t hear or is too intent on where he &apos;s going to stop ...
He races off .
She rushes after him .
37 37 EXT .
OUTSKIRTS OF SHIZ CAMPUS - DUSK Elphaba , breathless , approaches a remote area of campus , passing a dilapidated sign : &quot; Faculty Housing -- ANIMAL . &quot;
Nestled amongst a few small , odd buildings that have fallen into disrepair , Elphaba finds ... one light on , in one house .
41 38 38 INT . / EXT .
DILLAMOND &apos;S DWELLING - DUSK Elphaba approaches , hesitates-- is about to knock when she hears her teacher &apos;s voice : DILLAMOND ( O.S. )
This is much bigger than just some words on a chalkboard .
Elphaba freezes , listens-- DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) We Animals are now being blamed for everything that goes wrong .
Forced from our jobs .
Told to keep silent .
Elphaba moves to the window , peers through the crack in the curtain .
( She hears snippets , sees on ly pieces ... ) ELPHABA &apos;S POV : Dillamond huddles with the Bird Professor , and other Animals : a LEOPARD , a DEER , an OWL , a FROG , TAMARIN , and a SQUIRREL , all speak in tense , urgent WHISPERS ...
DEER We can still converse in private , thank Oz .
LEOPARD Not after dark .
Not without a speech permit .
Outside , Elphaba is troubled by what she &apos;s hearing ... DILLAMOND A dear friend of mine-- DEER A Deer ?
DILLAMOND A Co w , actually .
She &apos;s been speaking out , at protests , and recently wrote me , asking to meet at a cafe .
She said it was urgent ... That day , I was shown to their new non-speaking section .
Dillamond , using an Ozian contraption , lights his pipe ... BIRD And ?
What did your Deer friend-- SQUIRREL / FROG Cow-- 42 LEOPARD What did she tell you ?
DILLAMOND She never showed .
And no one &apos;s seen her since .
A silence , as this sinks in .
Then ... TAMARIN Yesterday a Badger acquaintance , a solicitor , was sacked .
Just for arguing a case !
OWL Who ?
DILLAMOND At least he can still argue .
LEOPARD What do you mean ? ?
Dillamond puffs his pipe .
Then looks back at them , grave .
Outside , Elphaba is riveted ... SONG : &quot; SOMETHING BAD &quot; DILLAMOND I &apos;VE HEARD OF AN OX A PROFESSOR FROM QUOX NO LONGER PERMITTED TO TEACH WHO HAS LOST ALL POWERS OF SPEECH !
Shocked by this , the Bird , Deer , Tamarin , Owl , Leopard , Squirrel and Frog all MURMUR to each other ... Outside , Elphaba , also deeply shaken by this , peers closer-- DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) AND AN OWL IN MUNCHKIN ROCK A VICAR WITH A THRIVING FLOCK FORBIDDEN TO PREACH NOW HE ONLY CAN SCREECH ONLY RUMORS -- BU T STILL -- ENOUGH TO GIVE PAUSE TO ANYONE WITH PAWS SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN OZ-- As the other Animals MURMUR anxiously : ANIMALS SOMETHING BAD , HAPPENING IN-- 43 LEOPARD That &apos;s it !
I &apos;m leaving Oz !
While I can still speak the word &quot; goodbye . &quot;
DEER Leave Oz ?
The Owl , Tamarin , Squirrel and Frog all react , alarmed .
Outside , Elphaba , equally shocked , takes a step backwards , steadies herself against the window for a moment .
And then-- AN IMAGE FLASHES before her eyes in BLACK AND WHITE : it looks like a barnyard .
Animals , unclothed , fenced in , emitting PLAINTIVE SOUNDS ... Elphaba GASPS .
Then , she blinks , coming back to reality , confused and troubled by what she &apos;s just seen .
Inside , hearing her gasp , the Animals freeze-- ears twitch , fur and feathers stand at attention .
Dillamond moves swiftly to his door , sticks his head out , and sees ... DILLAMOND Miss Elphaba ? !
What are you doing here ?
Before she can respond , he looks around ; motions h er inside .
Elphaba enters and is startled to find : The other Animals are gone-- the back window flung open .
Dillamond quickly shuts it , drawing the curtains .
ELPHABA Doctor Dillamond , what you were describing just now-- could something like that really happen ?
He regards her , his wise eyes grave .
DILLAMOND It is happening .
He removes his spectacles to clean them , drops them , rattled .
Elphaba picks them up , hands them to him .
Their eyes meet .
DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) If you make it discouraging enough , you can keep anyon e silent .
ELPHABA But , Doctor Dillamond , if Animals-- 44 DILLAMOND Shhh !
There &apos;s a SOUND-- is someone out there ?
Elphaba rushes to the window and peeks out : Sees nothing .
But Dillamond &apos;s nervous .
DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) You &apos;d better go .
He moves to the door .
She follows him , then-- ELPHABA If Animals are losing the ability to speak-- leaving Oz-- someone &apos;s got to tell the Wizard .
DILLAMOND Listen to me .
You cannot tell another soul what you &apos;ve heard and seen here tonight !
ELPHABA But-- that &apos;s why we have a Wizard !
( sings softly ) SO NOTHING BAD He looks at her .
And actually appears to be considering this .
Or is he just trying to mollify her-- ?
DILLAMOND Perhaps you &apos;re right .
BOTH NOTHING ALL THAT BAD NOTHING TRULY-- DILLAMOND ( suddenly BLEATS ) BAAAAAD .
They &apos;re both completely unnerved by this frightening , unfamiliar sound .
The Goat CLEARS HIS THROAT , tries to cover-- DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) Sorry .
I must be-- catching a cold .
She nods , troubled .
He opens the door , she starts out , turns back ; something makes her say ... ELPHABA Oz bless you , Doctor Dillamond .
He abruptly shuts the door .
45 OUTSIDE , ELPHABA STANDS THERE , her head reeling with everything she &apos;s witnessed , she SINGS SOFTLY TO HERSELF ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) IT COULDN &apos;T HAPPEN HERE IN OZ .... 39 39 EXT .
OUTSKIRTS OF SHIZ CAMPUS - NIGHT As Elphaba heads back towards her dorm , THE WIND PICKS UP AROUND HER .
Spooked , she glances around-- is she being followed ?
She listens .
Is that someone WHISPERING , or just the leaves ?
Suddenly-- HOOF BEATS !
She looks up-- A powerful multicolored HORSE is galloping straight towards her , about to trample her !
Elphaba leaps out of the way , stumbles , falls into a thicket-- The Horse stops short , turns to his rider , a strikingly beautiful young man in casual ( yet princely ) attire : FIYERO TIGELAAR .
HORSE ( to Fiyero ) I didn &apos;t see her !
FIYERO Nor did I-- Fiyero dismounts , goes to Elphaba-- FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) I &apos;m sorry , Miss , we didn &apos;t-- She looks up , the moonlight hits her face , he &apos;s taken aback by the green-- but not judgmental .
He holds out his hand-- FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) --see you .
You must &apos;ve-- blended in with the foliage .
S he scrambles to her feet , leaving his hand untouched , brushes herself off , as , to cover her self-consciousness-- ELPHABA Is this how you go through life , running amok , nearly trampling anyone in your path ?
FIYERO Well , sometimes I &apos;m asleep .
He studies her .
She sighs-- 46 ELPHABA Here we go ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) FIYERO No , I &apos;m not seasick !
Me either .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) Nor did I eat grass , as a You didn &apos;t ?
I did .
child !
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) And yes , I &apos;ve always been And the defensiveness- ?
Is green !
that a recent development ?
Elphaba looks at him a moment then turns , and stalks off .
Fiyero WHISTLES a distinctive whistle , and his Horse immediately comes over to him , then ... WHISPERS to him .
FIYE RO ( CONT &apos;D ) ( to the Horse ) I &apos;ll ask .
( calling out to Elphaba ) I &apos;m off for more trampling ; may we offer you a ride ?
ELPHABA ( without looking back ) Get stuffed .
FIYERO ( to his Horse ) Well , Feldspur , we &apos;ve been spurned by a girl .
I guess there &apos;s a first time for everything !
He climbs on .
They gallop past Elphaba .
She watches them go-- 40 40 EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD - DAY --SLAP !
An OZIAN PAPERBOY drops a stack of newspapers : &quot; PRINCE FIYERO OF WINKIE COUNTRY SPOTTED AT SHIZ ! &quot;
A FAST-PACED MONTAGE of sound and images as we follow the news of Fiyero &apos;s arrival getting passed along campus with an upbeat , rhythmic feel : --SWICK !
The boy cuts the twine .
WHOOSH .
The wind picks up a single newspaper , which floats away until-- --SWACK !
STUDENT 1 catches it in the air .
DING !
He tosses an Ozian coin at the Paperboy and reads as he walks until-- 47 --The wind grabs it , and as Boq rides by on an Ozian bicycle , it gets caught in the spokes -- FUP , FUP , FUP -- Boq pulls it out , surprised by the headline , but then-- --Pfannee and ShenShen walk by , SEE FIYERO &apos;S PICTURE , grab the newspaper out of his hands .
--ShenShen and Pfannee yank the paper back and forth until the wind grabs it again , and it flies UP , UP , UP , and the RHYTHM CRESCENDOS all the way to ... --the open dorm-room window , where Galinda is greeting the day .
SMACK !
The paper hits her in the face .
She peels it off , annoyed , but then instantly riveted ... --In the last beats of the rhythm , we speed through Galinda feverishly prepping herself : makeup , eyes , hair , and ...
SMASH TO : 41 41 EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD - DAY Galinda explodes out the door , dressed to the nines , surveying her surroundings like a shark seeking out its prey .
She sees a group of Students WHISPERING .
Then-- she spots Fiyero .
He &apos;s studying a campus map , seemingly oblivious to those Students stealing glances at him .
As Pfannee , ShenShen and a few others edge hesitantly towards Fiyero-- Galinda strides right up to him , like they know each oth er .
GALINDA Were you looking for something ?
Or-- someone ?
He looks at her , first confused , then amused .
FIYERO No , I was ... what was I doing ?
GALINDA How should I know ?
FIYERO Our first fight .
They assess each other , pleased by what they see .
GALINDA Well , I promised to give a guided tour to any recently arrived students , so ... ( MORE ) 48 GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) ( as if just realizing ) Oh , wait ... are you ... ?
FIYERO I am .
Though I &apos;m sure I won &apos;t last longer at this school than at any of the others .
She smiles her Galinda smile .
GALINDA But I wasn &apos;t at any of your other schools .
He smiles back .
42 42 INT .
SHIZ UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - DAY Elphaba , seated alone with her sister at a study table , looks up from her history textbook , whispers , to Nessa : ELPHABA I met the rudest person last night .
But Nessa is preoccupied , glancing surreptitiously over at-- Boq , who is searching the stacks ... NESSA Uh-huh .
As Elphaba watches , Avaric approaches Nessa &apos;s table , points to an open chair-- AVARIC May I ?
Nessa pulls her attention from Boq , nods yes to Avaric .
AVARIC ( CONT &apos;D ) I &apos;m Avaric .
From history .
They share a smile , then ... Nessa glances back at Boq .
AVARIC ( CONT &apos;D ) The class ?
Nessa looks back at Avaric , distracted .
NESSA What ?
Oh .
Yes .
... just as Galinda enters , with Fiyero ... 49 GALINDA And this is the-- book place !
Students look up , notice Fiyero-- AN EXCITED BUZZ STARTS UP .
ELPHABA ( to Nessa ) And there he is , with Galinda of course .
They deserve each other .
BACK ON GALINDA AND FIYERO : GALINDA There &apos;s a collection of rare books , somewhere ... and I guess some medium-rare books too ... Fiyero is checking out the female students ... FIYERO I see !
So many to choose from .
As Fiyero chec ks out girls , his eyes accidentally meet Elphaba &apos;s .
He recognizes her , starts to wave hello-- but Elphaba quickly looks away .
Flustered , she takes refuge in the Alchemy section , as Galinda guides Fiyero into ... ANOTHER SECTION .
They &apos;re alone , except for Boq , who climbs a nearby library ladder , pretending to peruse an upper shelf .
FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) What do you do for fun around here ?
GALINDA Nothing .
Until now .
F IYERO Ever been to the Ozdust Ballroom ?
GALINDA ( impressed ) But isn &apos;t it somewhat-- exclusive ?
I mean illegal ?
I mean-- scandalacious ?
Galinda tosses her hair again , possibly hitting herself a little too hard in the face , in her excitement .
FIYERO It &apos;s all of those things !
Also not far from here .
Another plus !
He notices Boq , at his eye level , on the ladder .
50 FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) ( to Boq ) Right ?
( friendly ) Fiyero Tigelaar .
Winkie Country .
Boq &apos;s a bit thrown by his hard-to-resist friendliness-- BOQ Boq Woodsman .
Of Munchkinland .
They shake , Boq nearly falls .
Fiyero helps him down , as ... GALINDA ( to Fiyero ; more hair tossing ) What were you saying , about the Ozdust , and fun , and you and me ... ?
Boq tries desperately to derail their fledgling plans-- BOQ Unfortunately it &apos;s again st Shiz rules to go into town after dark ... FIYERO Well , I see that , once again , the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls ... to me .
He throws an arm around his new pal , Boq , moves off with him , Galinda hurries after them-- SONG : &quot; DANCING THROUGH LIFE &quot; FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) ( to Boq ) THE TROUBLE WITH SCHOOLS IS THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TEACH THE WRONG LESSON BELIEVE ME , I &apos;VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW THEY WANT YOU TO BECOME LESS CALLOW LESS SHALLOW BUT I SAY : WHY INVITE STRESS IN ?

Fiyero leaps into a circular book-case ... as Elphaba , unable to concentrate , slams her Alchemy book shut .
ELPHABA What are you doing ? !
Various Students SHUSH her , as-- GALINDA ( to Elphaba ) Do you mind ?
Some of us are trying to learn something ? !
FIYERO DANCING THROUGH LIFE SWAYING AND SWEEPING AND ALWAYS KEEPING COOL LIFE IS FRAUGHT LESS WHEN YOU &apos;RE THOUGHTLESS THOSE WHO DON &apos;T TRY NEVER LOOK FOOLISH DANCING THROUGH LIFE MINDLESS AND CARELESS MAKE SURE YOU &apos;RE WHERE LESS TROUBLE IS RIFE WOES ARE FLEETING BLOWS ARE GLANCING WHEN YOU &apos;RE DANC ING ...

The Librarian tries to restore order , but Fiyero tosses her a romance novel .
She starts to read it , becomes engrossed ; as-- FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) LET &apos;S GO DOWN TO THE OZDUST BALLROOM WE &apos;LL MEET THERE LATER TONIGHT WE CAN DANCE TILL IT &apos;S LIGHT FIND THE PRETTIEST GIRL GIVE `ER A WHIRL 52 RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE OZDUST BALLROOM COME ON-- FOLLOW ME YOU &apos;LL BE HAPPY TO BE THERE ... ALL DANCING THROUGH LIFE DOWN AT THE OZDUST ... FIYERO IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO ... ALL NOTHING MATTERS BUT KNOWING NOTHING MATTERS IT &apos;S JUST LIFE ... STUDENTS AHHHH ... FIYERO SO KEEP DANCING THROUGH ... Galinda , breathless from dancing ( and from proximity to Fiyero ) fans herself .
BOQ Galinda-- ?
He offers her a handke rchief .
She takes it , dabs her face , then offers it back to him , he shakes his head-- BOQ ( CONT &apos;D ) Keep it , I &apos;ve got many .
( beat ) I cry a lot .
Boq immediately regrets this admission , gathers his nerve-- BOQ ( CONT &apos;D ) I hope you &apos;ll save a dance for me tonight .
I &apos;ll be right there .
Waiting .
All night .
GALINDA Oh-- that &apos;s so kind , Bick .
BOQ Technically it &apos;s Boq .
Galinda hesitates .
She doesn &apos;t want to hurt his feelings but ... just then , Galinda notices Nessa , at the other end of the library , and a lightbulb goes off .
53 GALINDA But you know what would be even kinder ?
( pointing to Nessa ) SEE THAT TRAGIC &apos;LY BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE ONE IN THE CHAIR IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR WE SHOULD GO ON A SPREE AND NOT SHE GEE-- I KNOW SOMEONE WOULD BE MY HERO IF THAT SOMEONE WERE TO GO INVITE HER ... BOQ Well , maybe I could invite her .
GALINDA OH , BICK , REALLY ?
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME ?
BOQ I would do anything for you .
Boq rushes off .
Galinda exhales , relieved .
She turns : there &apos;s Fiyero , watching her .
Appreciating her moves .
FIYERO ( game recognizes game ) You &apos;re good .
GALINDA It was nothing .
I love helping others .
Oh , and I happen to be free tonight .
After all-- ( sings ) NOW THAT WE &apos;VE MET ONE ANOTHER ... FIYERO / GALINDA IT &apos;S CLEAR WE DESERVE EACH OTHER GALINDA YOU &apos;RE PERFECT ... FIYERO YOU &apos;RE PERFECT ...
BOTH SO WE &apos;RE PERFECT TOGETHER BORN TO BE FOREVER ...
DANCING THROUG H LIFE !
Galinda and Fiyero exit the library together .
54 43 43 OMITTED 44 44 INT .
SHIZ UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - ANOTHER PART - CONTINUOUS Elphaba , annoyed , picking up scattered books , glances up to see : Boq , waving goodbye , to a beaming Nessa-- Elphaba goes over to her .
Nessa turns to her , in happy shock .
NESSA That perfectly adorable Munchkin boy finally asked me out !
ELPHABA Oh Nessa ... !
I had a feeling Avaric was interested !
NESSA Who ?
Oh , no , not Avaric .
Boq !
ELPHABA Oh .
NESSA Elphaba , he &apos;s everything I ever wanted !
ELPHABA Well-- good !
I just thought-- NESSA He said he was too shy to ask me , at first , but then , Galinda emboldened him-- ELPHABA What ?
Galinda ? !
But Nessa won &apos;t tolerate any more Galinda bashing-- NESSA Don &apos;t !
Don &apos;t you dare say another word against her !
I &apos;m about to have the happiest night of my life , thanks to Galinda !
( sings ) FIN &apos;LLY FOR THIS ONE NIGHT I &apos;M ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT WITH THIS MUNCHKIN BOY GALINDA FOUND FOR M E AND I ONLY WISH THERE WERE SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HER TO REPAY HER 55 ELPHABA , SEE ?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER AND GALINDA HELPED IT COME TRUE WE DESERVE EACH OTHER ME AND BOQ ...
Please , Elphaba , try to understand .
Elphaba , seeing her joy , takes Nessa &apos;s hand ; reminding us of that moment when Little Elphaba held her baby sister &apos;s hand .
ELPHABA I DO .
OFF ELPHABA , her surprise and emotion , at Galinda &apos;s kindness-- 45 45 OMITTED 46 46 EXT .
SHIZ CAMPUS - DORMITORIES - EVENING Inside each window , STUDENTS prepare for a wild night .
47 47 INT .
THE GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - EVENING Galinda is being fastened into her party frock by Pfannee-- as ShenShen looks through one of Galinda &apos;s many trunks .
PFANNEE Uh ... Galinda ... ?
ShenShen pulls out a tall pointy black hat , holding it at a distance , like it smells .
PFANNEE ( CONT &apos;D ) Explain !
SHENSHEN Ew !
What even is that ?
Galinda grabs the hat , laughs to mask her embarrassment .
GALINDA Oh dear , my granny makes me the most hideoteous hats !
( off their judge-y looks ) I &apos;d give it away , but-- I don &apos;t hate anyone that much .
They just keep looking at her , a mischievous challenge .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Oh no .
I couldn &apos;t .
Could I ?
56 Suddenly Elphaba enters , with an armful of books .
Pfannee and ShenShen give a private smirk to Galinda , then-- PFANNEE Well , we should-- SHENSHEN --go , we have to-- PFANNEE / SHENSHEN --accessorize each other !
See you soon !
( like they &apos;re all friends ) See you , Elphaba !
They exit .
Galinda turns , surprised to see Elphaba , still clutching her books , enter her territory .
ELPHABA Galinda-- Nessa and I were talking .
About you , and-- She takes a breath , puts down her alchemy and magic books .
On top of this stack is her notebook with &quot; Sorcery Seminar &quot; written on it .
Galinda eyes this with a stab of envy .
Then-- GALINDA And we were just talking about you !
How you should join us tonight !
ELPHABA ( after a beat ) I don &apos;t follow .
GALINDA ( with charades gestures ) You .
Join .
Us .
A t the Ozdust .
I &apos;m inviting you !
ELPHABA Why .
GALINDA Because everyone will be there .
And don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve nothing to wear , you could wear-- let &apos;s see-- She looks around , then-- holds the black hat out to Elphaba .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) --this !
Elphaba &apos;s taken aback .
Galinda seems really sincere .
57 GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) I mean , it goes with everything you own !
( sings ) IT &apos;S REALLY , UH , SHARP , DON &apos;T YOU THINK ?
YOU KNOW BLACK IS THIS YEAR &apos;S PINK !
YOU DESERVE EACH OTHER THIS HAT AND YOU YOU &apos;RE BOTH SO-- SMART YOU DESERVE EACH OTHER SO HERE , OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART .
Elphaba takes the hat , thrown by this second , unexpected show of generosity : have I misjudged this girl ... ?
48 48 EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD - NIGHT Students , including Galinda and Fiyero , all dressed for a night on the town , move stealthily through the quad-- 48A 48A EXT .
SHIZ CAMPUS - ENTRANCE COURTYARD - NIGHT The Students hurry to the water &apos;s edge , pile into waiting boats ...
Except Fiyero .
He waits , and now we see why : Boq and Nessa appear .
Fiyero greets Boq like they &apos;re old friends , then makes sure Nessa gets safely into a boat-- Galinda takes this in .
Falling a little in love .
49 49 EXT .
SHIZ - MORRIBLE &apos;S QUARTERS - NIGHT Elphaba hesitates , then-- KNOCKS .
After a beat , Morrible opens the door , dressed for bed , and surprised to see her prize student .
50 50 EXT .
LAKESIDE FOREST - NIGHT Fiyero confidently leads the group along the lake &apos;s edge and through the woods .
As they pass some night-blooming flowers , Fiyero leans down to a pink flower , politely-- FIYERO May I-- ?
The Flower graciously dips its petals , and he gently picks it , presents it to Galinda .
She &apos;s blown away .
The group follows Fiyero towards a giant LOTUS LEAF , with a large Turtle standing beside it .
58 The Turtle sees Fiyero , and immediately holds out a paw , they &quot; shake , &quot; and the Turtle snaps onto an enormous lotus leaf , and pulls it back , revealing A door .
Fiyero tosses the Turtle a coin , and the impressed Students follow him-- Galinda and Nessa trading excited looks as they move through the door , into ... Darkness .
It &apos;s dark .
Led by Fiyero ; Galinda , Boq , Nessa , and the others make their way dow n , into-- 51-52 51-52 OMITTED 53 53 INT .
THE OZDUST - NIGHT A WAVE OF SOUND and UNUSUAL SIGHTS welcome the group as they enter this BALLROOM .
The atmosphere is deliciously illicit .
A pumped CROWD ( some ANIMALS , some PEOPLE ) animates the dance floor .
A SWINGING BAND -- ( a mix of ANIMAL and HUMAN MUSICIANS ) BLASTS AWAY on the make-shift stage .
Fiyero procures a pitcher of punch ... and everyone toasts !
Fiyero pulls Galinda out onto the dance floor , and the others join them , dancing with wild abandon .
All except-- Boq and Nessa , who are off to the side ... silent .
Until-- NESSA What &apos;s in the punch ?
BOQ Lemons and melons and pears .
NESSA Oh my .
BOQ And ... a boatload of liquor .
Boq gulps down the entire glass as Nessa takes another small sip .
Neither knows what to say next .
Boq sneaks a look at Galinda , dancing close , with Fiyero .
It hurts .
He feels like a frau d , tries to come clean-- BOQ ( CONT &apos;D ) Listen , Nessa ... NESSA Yes ?
59 BOQ UH , NESSA I &apos;VE GOT SOMETHING TO CONFESS-- A REASON WHY-- WELL-- WHY I ASKED YOU HERE TONIGHT AND I KNOW IT ISN &apos;T FAIR-- NESSA Oh Boq .
I know why .
BOQ You do ?
NESSA IT &apos;S BECAUSE I &apos;M IN THIS CHAIR AND YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME-- WELL ?
ISN &apos;T THAT RIGHT ?
BOQ ( genuinely surprised ) What ?
No !
I don &apos;t feel sorry for you .
You &apos;re great !
I just ...
I asked you because ...
He looks at Galinda and just then-- she kisses Fi yero for the first time .
BOQ ( CONT &apos;D ) Because ... Boq turns back to Nessa ... but can &apos;t bring himself to tell her the whole truth-- BOQ ( CONT &apos;D ) BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL !
NESSA OH BOQ , I THINK YOU &apos;RE WONDERFUL AND WE DESERVE EACH OTHER DON &apos;T YOU SEE , THIS IS OUR CHANCE ?
WE DESERVE EACH OTHER DON &apos;T WE , BOQ ?
Galinda and Fiyero dance past Boq .
BOQ YOU KNOW WHAT ?
Desperate to overcome this heartache , he turns to Nessa-- BOQ ( CONT &apos;D ) LET &apos;S D ANCE !
60 NESSA What ?
BOQ LET &apos;S DAAAAANCE !
He pulls her onto the dance floor , and they dance !
It &apos;s exuberant , and joyous ; Nessa &apos;s having the time of her life .
Avaric , dancing with another GIRL , is distracted by Nessa &apos;s beauty and exuberance-- partly happy for her , partly wishing she was dancing with him ... Galinda clocks Boq and Nessa , happily dancing , relieved : everything worked out .
Thanks to me !
54 54 EXT .
LAKESIDE FOREST - NIGHT Morrible , wrapped in a dramatic cape , emerges with difficulty , and somewhat the worse for wear , from the tangle of foliage ... and comes face to face with the snapping Turtle .
He starts to SNAP at her-- but she draws herself up and glares at him , and the Turtle folds like a cheap suit .
55 55 INT .
THE OZDUST - SAME A SONG ENDS-- everyone on the dance floor APPLAUDS .
Just then , Morrible appears .
Our group stops in their tracks .
Morrible approaches a stunned Galinda .
MORRIBLE You .
Galinda is frozen with fear , but also-- a little tipsy .
GALINDA Me ?
Morrible takes her hand , leads her away , as ... MORRIBLE The rest of you can go on doing-- whatever this is .
The others breathe sighs of relief as Galinda , with an anx ious backward glance to her friends , follows Morrible to : A PRIVATE NOOK , NEARBY-- Galinda regards her idol , and ( due to tipsiness and fandom ) can &apos;t hold back-- 61 GALINDA Madame Morrible , you are-- no , seriously , I admire you so , soooo-- MORRIBLE Enough .
Morrible reaches into her cape , pulls out ... a wand .
GALINDA A magic wand ! ?
It &apos;s-- It &apos;s-- ( a teeny bit disappointed ) It &apos;s so small .
MORRIBLE It &apos;s a training wand .
GALINDA ( takes it , overwhelmed ) Oh , Madame-- how can I express my gratitution ? !
It is my heart &apos;s desire to become a sorceress .
Thank you .
For having faith in me !
MORRIBLE I have no faith in you , dear .
This was your roommate &apos;s idea , not mine .
Galinda &apos;s confused .
GALINDA I &apos;m confused .
MORRIBLE Miss E lphaba has requested that I include you in our sorcery seminar-- she insisted I tell you this very night , or she would quit .
GALINDA She did ?
But why ?
MORRIBLE I &apos;m a sorceress , not a mind reader !
I &apos;ve no idea why !
But I cannot risk losing her .
So-- here I am .
Morrible regards Galinda , tries her best to be-- kind .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) My personal opinion , dear , is that you do not have-- what it takes .
I hope you pr ove me wrong .
I doubt you will .
( MORE ) 62 MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) ( beat ) You might want to thank her .
She &apos;s on her way .
Suddenly Galinda is stone cold sober .
GALINDA What ?
MORRIBLE Well , you invited her .
( looks around , mutters ) I need a drink .
Morrible sweeps away .
Galinda starts back to her friends , stops short , seeing : GALINDA ( a guilt-ridden whisper ) Oh no .
Elphaba appears in the entryway , wearing the black pointy hat .
There &apos;s a RIPPLE OF REACTION ; as others spot her-- S NICKERS AND WHISPERS , the students stop dancing , stare , point .
Even the Musicians STOP PLAYING , staring ... at the weird , green girl in the ridiculous eyesore of a hat .
Elphaba takes in the reaction around her , realizing : she &apos;s been tricked .
She yanks the hat off , locks eyes with : Galinda , who stares back at her , flooded with remorse .
Elphaba starts to leave .
But then-- She suddenly strides angrily to the center of the dance floor , and defiantly slams the hat ba ck on her head .
Backing away , Nessa whispers to Boq ... NESSA I can &apos;t watch .
Elphaba starts to slowly dance by herself .
In an idiosyncratic manner all her own .
FIYERO I &apos;ll say this much , she doesn &apos;t give a twig what anyone thinks .
GALINDA Of course she does .
She just pretends not to .
( MORE ) 63 GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) ( looking at the wand ) I feel awful .
FIYERO Why ?
It &apos;s not like it &apos;s your fault .
Galinda looks at him , then hands him the wand , and crosses to Elphaba , still dancing alone .
Galinda taps her shoulder .
GALINDA May I cut in ?
Elphaba turns , Galinda hesitates , then , as best she can , imitates Elphaba &apos;s unique moves .
The MUSICIANS START UP AGAIN , matching her moves .
Elphaba watches , coldly .
But as Galinda conti nues to dance in Elphaba &apos;s style-- it becomes an offering of friendship .
As Galinda dances , she whirls and comes face to face with Pfannee and ShenShen .
Disgusted , they whisper harshly ... PFANNEE SHENSHEN What are you doing ?
Stop !
Galinda hesitates , but then-- she turns her back on them , and returns to Elphaba .
The two roommates dance together .
It &apos;s fluid , interconnected ... inspired ... Other students gradually pick up the moves until everyone , even Pfannee and ShenShen , are dancing , Elphaba-style .
Nessa , Boq , and Fiyero join Galinda and Elphaba , and suddenly the five of them are dancing together , as though they &apos;d known each other all their lives ... ALL DANCING THROUGH LIFE HERE AT THE OZDUST IF ONLY BECAUSE DUST IS WHAT WE COME TO AND HERE &apos; S A STRANGE THING : YOUR LIFE COULD END UP CHANGING WHILE YOU &apos;RE DANCING THROUGH !
56 56 INT .
SHIZ - GIRLS &apos; DORM ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT Elphaba shrugs out of her clothes , Galinda brushes her teeth at the washbasin , as they continue bonding ... 64 GALINDA That was your very first party ?
( spits ) Ever ?
Elphaba yanks her worn nightgown over her head-- ELPHABA Do funerals count ?
Galinda takes the pink flower Fiyero gave her from her hair , places it carefully in a glass of water ...
The girls flop on Elphaba &apos;s bed , regard each other .
GALINDA I couldn &apos;t remotely sleep .
ELPHABA Me neither .
GALINDA I know !
Let &apos;s each tell the other something we &apos;ve never told an yone !
I &apos;ll go first : Fiyero and I are getting married !
ELPHABA He asked you already ?
GALINDA Oh , he doesn &apos;t know yet .
( beat ) Now you tell me a secret .
ELPHABA Like what ?
GALINDA Like-- why do you sleep with this-- ( grabs it ) --little green bottle under your pillow ?
ELPHABA Give that back !
GALINDA ( holding it out of reach ) Come on-- tell !
A beat , Elphaba manages to control her emotions ... 65 ELPHABA It was my mother &apos;s , that &apos;s all .
Elphaba grabs the bottle , shoves it back under her pillow .
GALINDA Well that &apos;s not fair , I told you a really good one .
Galinda stands , and crosses to her side of the room , and turns on her pink light .
Elphaba rises , and moves to Galinda &apos;s side .
After a beat-- ELPHABA My father hates me .
Galinda GASPS .
Elphaba &apos;s amused .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) That &apos;s not the secret .
The secret is .
..
He has a good reason .
( a statement of fact ) It &apos;s my fault .
GALINDA What , what is ?
ELPHABA That my sister is-- the way she is .
( a beat ) When our mother was carrying Nessa , our father began to worry .
That the new baby might come out ... GALINDA Green ?
Elphaba nods .
She &apos;s never spoken about this-- to anyone .
ELPHABA He was so worried , he made our mother chew milk flowers , day and night .
Only it made Nessa c ome too soon ... with her little legs all tangled .
And our mother ... never woke up .
Galinda takes this in .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) None of which would ever have happened ... if not for me .
66 GALINDA But that was the milkflowers &apos; fault , not yours .
Galinda looks at Elphaba and for the first time-- sees her .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) That may be your secret , Elphaba .
But it doesn &apos;t make it true .
She also sees that Elphaba still believes it .
To lighten things , Galinda looks out the window : the sun is rising .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Look-- it &apos;s tomorrow !
And Elphie-- may I call you Elphie ?
ELPHABA It &apos;s a little perky .
GALINDA And you can call me ... Galinda .
ELPHABA It &apos;s your name .
GALINDA Let &apos;s not quarrel .
Because Elphie-- now that we &apos;re friends , I &apos;ve decided to make you my new project !
ELPHABA You really don &apos;t have to do that .
GALINDA I know !
That &apos;s what makes me so nice !
SONG : &quot; POPULAR &quot; GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) WHENEVER I SEE SOMEONE LESS FORTUNATE THAN I ( AND LET &apos;S FACE IT--WHO ISN &apos;T LESS FORTUNATE THAN I ? )
MY TENDER HEART TENDS TO START TO BLEED ... AND WHEN SOMEONE NEEDS A MAKEOVER I SIMPLY HAVE TO TAKE OVER I KNOW I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED AND EVEN IN YOUR CASE ( removing Elphaba &apos;s glasses ) 67 THO &apos; IT &apos;S THE TOUGHEST CASE I &apos;VE YET TO FACE ( putting Elphaba &apos;s glasses back on her ) DON &apos;T WORRY-- I &apos;M DETERMINED TO SUCCEED FOLLOW MY LEAD AND YES , INDEED YOU WILL BE ... She hops up , and hits the top of a wardrobe case-- it pops open , revealing an array of garments .

Galinda shines a bright light in Elphaba &apos;s face like a police interrogati on , examines her complexion with a magnifying glass-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) DON &apos;T BE OFFENDED BY MY FRANK ANALYSIS THINK OF IT AS PERSONALITY DIALYSIS NOW THAT I &apos;VE CHOSEN TO BECOME A PAL , A SIS- TER AND ADVISER THERE &apos;S NOBODY WISER NOT WHEN IT COMES TO POPULAR -- Galinda opens more trunks and bags , revealing more and more clothes , shoes , accessories , and scary beauty devices , as-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) I KNOW ABOUT POPULAR AND WITH AN ASSIST FROM ME TO BE WHO YOU &apos;LL BE 68 INSTEAD OF DREARY WHO-YOU-WERE ...

GALINDA Elphie !
You mustn &apos;t think that way-- your whole life is going to change !
And all because of me !
Galinda pulls Elphaba out on the balcony ... GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) WHEN I SEE DEPRESSING CREATURES WITH UNPREPOSSESSING FEATURES I REMIND THEM ON THEIR OWN BEHALF TO THINK OF CELEBRATED HEADS OF STATE OR SPECIALLY GREAT COMMUNICATORS DID THEY HAVE BRAINS OR KNOWLEDGE ?
Galinda steers Elphaba back into their room , then Galinda jumps onto her bed , danceing and waving her training wand ... GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) DON &apos;T MAKE ME LAUGH !
THEY WERE-- POPULAR !
PLEASE-- IT &apos;S ALL ABOUT POPULAR !
IT &apos;S NO T ABOUT APTITUDE IT &apos;S THE WAY YOU &apos;RE VIEWED SO IT &apos;S VERY SHREWD TO BE VERY VERY POPULAR LIKE ME !
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Now then .
Let us begin .
Hair .
We toss our hair .
See ?
Toss !
Toss !
She demonstrates .
Elphaba tries-- with minimal success .
69 GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Well-- you &apos;ll practice !
And now-- ( picks up her magic wand ) I shall transform your simple &quot; frock &quot; into a magnificent ball gown !
ELPHABA Oh no .
Galinda readies herself-- points her wand ... GALINDA Ball gown .
They wait .
Nothing happens .
Galinda rolls her head , jabs with the wand , like a fighter in her corner , then-- points again .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Ball gown !
More nothing .
Galinda warms up again , even more vi gorously , then-- points her wand yet again , with fierce determination .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Ball gown !
( she examines her wand ) Is this on ?
ELPHABA I can &apos;t wear things like that anyway .
Galinda , struck by Elphaba &apos;s words , forgets about her wand .
GALINDA Of course you can .
We &apos;ll just start ... smaller .
Galinda moves to her pink flower , and carefully pins it into Elphaba &apos;s hair .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) ( a discovery ) Pink goes good wit h green .
ELPHABA It goes well with green .
GALINDA It so does .
Galinda regards Elphaba with wonder ; makes another discovery .
70 GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Why , Miss Elphaba-- you &apos;re beautiful .
She guides her to the mirror .
Elphaba looks-- at her own reflection .
And for a split second , she allows herself to like what she sees .
But then-- ELPHABA I-- I have to go-- She rushes out .
Galinda calls after her-- GALINDA You &apos;re welcome !
( then ) AND THO &apos; YOU PROTEST YOUR DISINTEREST I KNOW CLANDESTINEDLY YOU &apos;RE GONNA GRIN AND BEAR IT YOUR NEW-FOUND POPULARI TY -- LA , LA , LA , LA ... YOU &apos;LL BE POPULAR The rising sun turns Galinda &apos;s silhouette pink as she triumphantly climbs her tower of luggage-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) JUST NOT QUITE AS POPULAR AS ME !
57 57 EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD NEAR DINING HALL - DAY Galinda breezes off with her friends ...
When the coast is clear , Elphaba peeks cautiously out from an archway , sees : More students coming towards her .
Self-conscious , Elphaba ducks back into the archway , takes a breath , then : certain she &apos;s alone , she tries some covert hair tossing ... FIYERO ( O.S. )
You &apos;ve been Galinda-fied .
She whirls around .
There &apos;s Fiyero , studying her .
FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) You don &apos;t need to d o that , you know .
Before she can summon a snappy response , or any response , he saunters on .
Off Elphaba , discombobulated by this ... 71 58 58 MONTAGE : VARIOUS LOCATIONS Elphaba enters the dining hall , self-conscious , to see : Galinda , Nessa , Boq , and Fiyero all seated together , in animated conversation .
Without skipping a beat , they all make room for her to sit .
Elphaba looks at Galinda , who smiles .
See ?
Elphaba gives her best hair-toss , and they all CRACK UP ; ( as before , Elphaba &apos;s laugh is a distinctive CACKLE . )
WE HEAR a new &quot; needle-drop &quot; version of &quot; DANCING THROUGH LIFE . &quot;
It &apos;s coming from-- AN OZIAN RADIO , The five friends sit around a crackling CAMPFIRE .
Nessa helps Boq toss kindling on the fire , crackling in the fireplace .
Galinda and Elphaba laugh until they cry .
Fiyero is immersed in one of Elphaba &apos;s books .
Elphaba takes notice .
The SONG ( and the MONTAGE ) CONTINUES : --IN THE QUAD : Boq leads the friends through throngs of students-- --IN THE WOODS : Elphaba , Fiyero , and Nessa continue to follow Boq-- Galinda , in high heels , can &apos;t keep up ... Elphaba circles back , pulls off Galinda &apos;s shoes ; Galinda sprints off after her friends , with a few backward glances at her abandoned heels ... A SECLUDED CLEARING : Boq leads them to a huge , rotting tree .
The friends look around , then back to Boq , puzzled-- why have you brought us here ?
I n answer , Boq pulls out ... an axe .
--LATER .
The dead tree is partly cleared .
Fiyero takes off his shirt .
Wow .
Boq takes off his shirt .
Wow ?
REVEAL Nessa , Elphaba and a somewhat distracted ( by Fiyero ) Galinda , as the three girls chop and haul away the rest of the tree .
--LIBRARY : They &apos;re at one table , leaves still stuck to their hair and clothes .
Elphaba studies .
Nessa shares her notes with Boq .
Galinda is studying an enormous tome-- but there &apos;s a fashion magazine hidden inside .
Fiyero &apos;s asleep .
--THAT SAME FOREST AREA : A badminton-type net , strung between two trees .
Nessa slams an amazing shot .
--PICTURESQUE HILLSIDE : As the sun rises , the tribe trudge up a hill .
Galinda now wears a pair of Elphaba &apos;s boots .
Elphaba stumbles and a hand reaches out to help her .
It &apos;s Nessa Elphaba takes it ; the sister &apos;s eyes meet ... and all five burst into SONG : 72 ELPHABA / GALINDA / FIYERO / NESSA / BOQ ALL OF OUR LIFE WE &apos;LL BE TOGETHER FIVE FRIENDS FOREVER ME , YOU , YOU AND YOU ... AND YOU SUCH A QUINTET THERE HAS NEVER BEEN YET !
BRING ON LIFE AND WATCH US DANCE ON THROUGH ...
They see ... A field of poppies .
Excited , they link arms one by one ... END MONTAGE .
59 59 INT .
DILLAMOND &apos;S CLASSROOM - DAY The tribe enters .
Various students are already standing there , CHATTING before class ... All at once , Dillamond rushes in .
Elphaba goes to him , holds out a bunch of poppies-- ELPHABA Doctor Dillamond , I picked some poppies for you-- But Dillamond ignores the poppies-- DILLAMOND Not now , Miss Elphaba-- ( to everyone ) Please , everyone , take your seats , I &apos;ve something to say , and very little time .
Surprised by his urgency , the students quickly take seats ; the tribe sits in one row , together ... DILLAMOND ( CONT &apos;D ) My dear students , this is my last day here at Shiz .
You see , Animals-- are no longer permitted to teach .
Elphaba rockets to her feet .
ELPHABA What ?
DILLAMOND It &apos;s alright , Miss Elphaba ...
I &apos;ll be alright .
Suddenly a WHISTLE BLAST .
Elphaba and the others startle-- 73 TWO UNIFORMED GUARDS enter-- they &apos;re followed by the Shiz University President , and an anxious Miss Coddle-- MISS CODDLE Students , remain calm , please , there &apos;s no cause for alarm-- ELPHABA What is this , what &apos;s happening ?
As the Guards approach him-- DILLAMOND Don &apos;t worry !
They can take away my job , but I shall continue speaking out !
FIRST GUARD Come on , Goat .
Elphaba rushes up to the President , and Miss Coddle-- ELPHABA You can &apos;t permit this !
MISS CODDLE Miss Elphaba , I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s out of our hands .
ELPHABA But-- As the Guards start to lead him away , Dillamond calls out-- DILLAMOND Listen to me-- !
( to Elphaba ) You &apos;re not being told the whole story !
The Guard shoves him , Dillamond &apos;s spectacles fall to the floor-- the Guard &apos;s boot is about to crush them-- Elphaba grabs the spectacles just in time , starts after him-- ELPHABA Doctor Dillamond-- !
But the President blocks her , and Dillamond is led away .
Elphaba turns in desperation to the other students-- ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Are we all just going to sit here , in silence ? !
74 SHIZ PRESIDENT That &apos;s quite enough , Miss Elphaba .
Take your seat .
Elphaba stands there , the poppies she picked for Dillamond still clutched in her hand ... Galinda goes to her , and gently leads her to her seat , as-- MISS CODDLE Students , your new history professor has prepared a special presentation !
PROFESSOR NIKIDIK , somber , human , enters .
He carries a rectangular , cloth-covered package , pushes Dilla mond &apos;s vase of poppies roughly to one side , and places the package on Dillamond &apos;s desk .
The package shakes slightly on its own .
The students leans forward , curious .
PROFESSOR NIKIDIK Good afternoon , students .
MISS CODDLE Good afternoon !
THE STUDENTS Good afternoon .
PROFESSOR NIKIDIK In times such as these , it behooves us all , not merely to study the past , but to look to the future ... Nikidik pulls t he cloth off with a flourish , revealing : a small cage with a LION CUB inside .
PROFESSOR NIKIDIK ( CONT &apos;D ) This is called-- a &quot; cage &quot; Elphaba &apos;s eyes widen in horror and shock .
But the other students coo , charmed : &quot; AWWW . &quot;
The CUB TREMBLES ; HISSES , baring sharp , tiny teeth .
NIKIDIK This remarkable innovation is for the good of all Oz , as well as for the Animal &apos;s own good .
You see-- 75 ELPHABA ( loudly ) If it &apos;s so good , why is he trembling ?
Galinda catches Elphaba &apos;s eye : Shhh .
As-- NIKIDIK He &apos;s just excited to be here !
Elphaba turns to Nessa , who looks back , imploring her : don &apos;t make a scene !
NIKIDIK ( CONT &apos;D ) One benefit of caging an animal this young is : he will likely never learn to speak !
The Students MURMUR , intrigued .
ELPHABA Oh no ... NIKIDIK Now , the dimensions of the cage will vary , depe nding on the animal .
But here is the basic design ... As Nikidik draws on the chalkboard-- Elphaba surveys the other Students in furious disbelief : They &apos;re listening avidly , dutifully taking notes-- ELPHABA ( to her friends ) Can you imagine a world where Animals are kept in cages , and never speak ? !
( turns to Fiyero ) What are we going to do ? !
FIYERO We ?
ELPHABA Well somebody &apos;s got to DO SOMETHING ! !
She throws down the poppies in her hand .
The poppies rise , begin to spin .
It &apos;s beautiful , and strange .
Those present notice these rising , spinning poppies , look up at them , when suddenly-- the poppies release a green-gold pollen ... FIYERO What &apos;s happening ?
76 ELPHABA I don &apos;t know , I got mad , and-- The pollen is making it hard for Elphaba to see-- people are panicking , then-- dropping into a sudden sleep .
FIYERO ( O.S. )
Well , are you coming ?
Elphaba turns and , through the poppy pollen , she sees : Fiyero , at the door , the sleeping Cub in his arms .
Elphaba moves to him , glances back nervously to the collapsed bodies-- ELPHABA Are they-- alright ?
FIYERO They &apos;re falli ng asleep !
Poppy dust .
Come on !
She shakes herself to attention , and they rush out-- 60 60 OMITTED 61 61 EXT .
OUTSKIRTS OF CAMPUS - DAY Elphaba and Fiyero , with the Cub , run as fast as they can-- she spots , up ahead-- TWO BICYCLES , PROPPED AGAINST A TREE .
ELPHABA Look !
Elphaba grabs one bike , Fiyero puts the Cub in its basket , then hops on the other bike , pedals off , and she follows , peddling at top speed , with the Cub in the bicycle basket .
62 62 OMITTED 63 63 INT .
CLASSROOM - DAY Morrible enters the classroom to find : everyone still fast asleep .
And the cage , empty .
MORRIBLE What in the name of Oz ... ?
Nikidik wakes up , sees : the Cub is missing !
He &apos;s baffled .
Just then , the Students start to stir .
They &apos;re dazed , with no idea what happened .
As Galinda opens her eyes , she looks around at her friends and sees ... Elphaba and Fiyero are gone .
77 CLOSE ON Morrible , her gears turning .
She rushes out ... 64 64 EXT .
SHIZ WOODS - CLEARING - DUSK They abandon the bikes .
Fiyero wraps the sleeping Cub in his jacket in front of two diverging paths .
Fiyero points-- FIYERO So-- this way ?
Or-- He points in the other direction-- FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) ( adjusts Cub in his arms ) Of course , we could go this way-- ELPHABA Don &apos;t shake him !
FIYERO I &apos;m not !
( studying the Cub ) I think he &apos;s waking up .
ELPHABA Well , we can &apos;t let him loose just anywhere , we &apos;ve got to find someplac e safe !
FIYERO I realize that !
( then ) You think I &apos;m really stupid , don &apos;t you .
ELPHABA No !
Not really stupid .
Suddenly they hear VOICES in the distance .
Fiyero points to one path ; lushly overgrown-- FIYERO This way .
Come on-- Fiyero pulls the Cub from his jacket .
Elphaba leans close to check the Cub , but it trembles and draws back , afraid-- ELPHABA You don &apos;t need to be scared of me-- Fiyero gently puts t he frightened Cub down .
As Elphaba studies it , concerned ... Fiyero studies her .
78 FIYERO Why is it you &apos;re always causing some sort of commotion ?
ELPHABA I don &apos;t cause commotions , I am one !
FIYERO That &apos;s for sure .
ELPHABA So I should just keep my mouth shut ? !
Is that what you &apos;re saying ?
FIYERO No , I &apos;m saying-- ELPHABA You think I want to be this way ?
You think I want to care this much ?
FIYERO I just meant-- ELPHABA You think I don &apos;t know how much easier my life would be if I didn &apos;t ? !
FIYERO D o you ever let anyone else talk ?
ELPHABA Oh .
Sorry .
( beat ) But can I just say one more thing ?
FIYERO Uh , I think you are-- ELPHABA You could &apos;ve walked away back there .
FIYERO So ?
ELPHABA So no matter how shallow and self- absorbed you pretend to be-- 79 FIYERO Excuse me , there &apos;s no pretense here : I happen to be genuinely self- absorbed and deeply shallow .
ELPHABA No , you &apos;re not .
Or you wouldn &apos;t be so unhappy .
She looks at him , and sees him .
He &apos;s suddenly uncomfortable .
FIYERO Fine .
Look-- if you don &apos;t want my help-- ELPHABA No .
I do-- !
She grabs his arm .
It &apos;s a charged moment .
She quickly lets go , turns back to the Cub , covering .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) His heart is poundi ng .
I didn &apos;t mean to frighten him .
FIYERO What did you mean to do , back there ?
And why was I the only one you didn &apos;t do it to ?
They &apos;re looking at each other .
ELPHABA You &apos;re bleeding .
FIYERO ( still looking at her ) I am ?
ELPHABA ( looking back at him , mesmerized ) It must &apos;ve scratched you .
Fiyero nods , staring at her .
FIYERO Yeah ... Or maybe it scratched me , or something .
Elphaba reaches out to touch his face .
Fiy ero abruptly moves .
80 FIYERO ( CONT &apos;D ) I better get to safety .
I mean-- the Cub-- ELPHABA Yes , of course-- FIYERO Get the cub to safety ...
He runs off with the Cub .
She instinctively starts after him-- ELPHABA Fiyero-- !
SONG : &quot; I &apos;M NOT THAT GIRL &quot; She looks down at her hand .
The hand that touched-- his face .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) HANDS TOUCH , EYES MEET SUDDEN SILENCE , SUDDEN HEAT HEARTS LEAP IN A GIDDY WHIRL HE COULD BE THAT BOY BUT I &apos;M NOT THAT GIRL Elphaba leans on a branch and it bends along with her , dipping her , as if it &apos;s her dancing partner .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) DON &apos;T DREAM TOO FAR DON &apos;T LOSE SIGHT OF WHO YOU ARE DON &apos;T REMEMBER THAT RUSH OF JOY HE COULD BE THAT BOY I &apos;M NOT THAT GIRL EV &apos;RY SO OFTEN WE LONG TO STEAL TO THE LAND OF WHAT-MIGHT-HAVE-BEEN BUT THAT DOESN &apos;T SOFTEN THE ACHE WE FEEL WHEN REALITY SETS BACK IN Determined to return to reality , Elphaba starts back-- 64A 64A EXT .
OUTSKIRTS OF SHIZ CAMPUS ELPHABA BLITHE SMILE , LITHE LIMB SHE WHO &apos;S WINSOME , SHE WINS HIM GOLD HAIR WITH A GENTLE CURL THAT &apos;S THE GIRL HE CHOSE AND HEAVEN KNOWS I &apos;M NOT THAT GIRL ... 81 65 65 EXT .
SHIZ QUAD - NIGHT Elphaba enters the quad , and suddenly-- there &apos;s Fiyero , coming towards her .
ON ELPHABA : Her heart leaps-- But then she sees : Galinda .
hurrying towards him .
Elphaba ducks behind an archway , watching : as they embrace .
Forcing herself to look .
To accept .
ELPHABA DON &apos;T WISH , DON &apos;T START WISHING ONLY WOUNDS THE HEART I WASN &apos;T BORN FOR THE ROSE AND PEARL THERE &apos;S A GIRL I KNOW HE LOVES HER SO Elphaba watches covertly as , across the quad , Fiyero and Galinda meet up with Boq and Nessa .
The two couples go off together .
And she lets go of the dream-- of being like them .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) I &apos;M NOT THAT GIRL ... Elphaba turns and heads in the opposite direction ... alone .
FADE TO BLACK : 66 66 OMITTED 82 We hear over black : MORRIBLE ( O.S. )
MISS ELPHABA-- COME AT ONCE !
67 67 EXT .
SHIZ - ENTRANCE COURTYARD / BALCONY - DAY Elphaba and Galinda burst through the doors of Madame Morrible &apos;s quarters onto the balcony .
THEIR POV : Below , on the lawn , AN EXCITED CROWD has gathered .
And in the middle of it stands a beaming Morrible-- who spots Elphaba on the balcony , motions to her ...
The girls rush down to Morrible , who points ... MORRIBLE Miss Elphaba-- Look !
Elphaba and Galinda look up to see ...
IN THE SKY : A MINIATURE HOT AIR BALLOON ... with the words &quot; Omaha State Fair &quot; painted on the side , attached to a tiny basket .
As it gets closer , they hear the TINKLING of a MUSIC BOX .
Elphaba looks from the little balloon , back to Morrible .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) I finally heard back from the Wizard .
And look-- !
83 The MUSIC BOX TUNE SLOWS DOWN , as the little balloon lands ... at Elphaba &apos;s feet .
Galinda and Elphaba exchange a look of total wonder .
The Student onlookers are riveted .
Elphaba kneels down to examine it , and sees : Nestled in the balloon &apos;s basket-- a bright green envelope .
It reads : &quot; For Miss Elphaba Thropp &quot; in exquisite calligraphy .
As the Students jostle each other and lean in , Galinda is pushed aside .
She stands at the back of the crowd .
For the first time , she &apos;s not the center of attention .
Elphaba opens the note and reads aloud : ELPHABA &quot; His Royal Ozness , the Wonderful Wizard of Oz , summons you most ceremony-ishly to his personal Palace in the Emerald City . &quot;
El phaba squints , to read the fine print : ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) &quot; This invitation is non- transferable . &quot;
( looking up , in wonder ) Oh Madame !
This news RIPPLES through the Students , including Pfannee and ShenShen .
Morrible picks up the hot air balloon .
There &apos;s a crank attached to the music box .
Morrible winds it back up , and sends it back into the air , as ... Pfannee , ShenShen , and Other Students surround Elphaba , congra tulating her .
Elphaba is giddy ; it &apos;s like her fantasy !
Morrible pulls her aside , speaks quietly , confidentially ... MORRIBLE This is your chance .
To make good .
Of course , you &apos;ll have to prove yourself first .
ELPHABA ( brought up short ) Prove myself ?
MORRIBLE Prove yourself worthy .
Dearie , this is the Wizard of Oz !
If he &apos;s going to grant your heart &apos;s desire-- ELPHABA But-- prove myself how ? !
It &apos;s too soon , I &apos;m not ready-- !
84 MORRIBLE Don &apos;t be so pessi-mystical .
You &apos;ll find a way .
I have faith in you .
As Elphaba takes this in .
It starts to rain .
Galinda makes her way through the crowd of Students over to Elphaba-- just as Morrible , protective , hastily opens an umbrella , holds it over Elphaba .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Mustn &apos;t let you get wet !
Not when you &apos;re on the cusp of greatness !
Morrible makes a few bold , sorceress-y gestures , and the rain stops instantly .
Elphaba , Galinda , and the students are stunned , then impressed .
GALINDA ( to Pfannee and ShenShen ) What did Madame Morrible just say ?
PFANNEE / SHENSHEN That Elphaba mustn &apos;t get wet !
Galinda looks at Elphaba-- their eyes meet .
Galinda goes to embrace her roommate , but Morrible pulls Elphaba aside again , whispers to her-- MORRIBLE My powers are purely meteorological .
I can stop and start rain , make a bit of wind .
But you , Dearie , I believe-- Morrible regards Elphaba with motherly pride , then gently tilts Elphaba &apos;s chin up , till she meets her gaze .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Your powers could be ... ELPHABA ( hardly dares say it ) Unlimited ?
MORRIBLE NOW YOU &apos;RE OFF TO MEET THE WIZARD MAKE ME PROUD ... ELPHABA I will-- ( sings ) I &apos;LL TRY .
85 MORRIBLE AND THERE YOU &apos;LL FIN &apos;LLY BE : THE WIZARD-- ELPHABA AND I ... 68 68 EXT .
TRAIN STATION - PLATFORM - DAY Charmingly old fashioned , bustling with HUMANS and ANIMALS ... A gleaming green TRAIN sits beside the platform .
FIND : Elphaba , in stylish black travel garb , being fussed over by Galinda .
GALINDA Now , you &apos;re sure you have everything ?
( no response ) Elphie !
ELPHABA ( staring past Galinda ) I can &apos;t believe it .
Galinda follows her gaze , to see : Nessa , with their father , Governor Thropp , coming towards them .
Elphaba stares , stunned , as Nessa and Governor Thropp approach-- NESSA Look who &apos;s come to see you off !
ELPHABA Father !
I-- I never dreamed-- Now Elphaba sees Dulcibear , her former Nanny-- ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) And Dulcibear !
How are you ?
Dulcibear starts to reply , then-- gives Elphaba a Bear hug instead , just as Madame Morrible joins them , breathless-- MORRIBLE Governor Thropp-- you received my message !
So good of you to come !
GOVERNOR THROPP Of course !
I treasure any chance to see my dear daughter .
86 Governor Thropp kisses Nessa on the cheek .
Morrible , Dulcibear , and Galinda all clock the effect this has on Elphaba .
Morrible turns to Governor Thropp .
MORRIBLE And such an honor , that your other daughter be welcomed by the Wizard .
GOVERNOR THROPP Yes .
Let &apos;s just hope she makes a good impression .
This lands hard on an already nervous Elphaba-- GALINDA I &apos;m sure she will .
Just then-- PFANNEE / SHENSHEN ( O. S. ) Elphaba-- !
Suddenly Elphaba is engulfed by a group of Students , showering her with hugs and good wishes .
Boq appears from out of this crowd .
Nessa brightens-- NESSA There you are !
Father , this is Boq , the boy I wrote to you about !
BOQ ( distracted ) What ?
Oh , yes , Governor Thropp ... good to meet you .
Governor Thropp shakes Boq &apos;s hand .
GOVERNOR THROPP I &apos;ve heard so much about you .
My Nessarose is very pre cious to me ... You &apos;d better take good care of her .
Boq &apos;s collar suddenly feels tighter .
He gulps , backs away-- BOQ I understand .
Well .
I should-- uh-- ( abruptly , to Galinda ) May I speak with you ?
Privishly ?
Before she can answer , Boq pulls her aside .
Elphaba and Nessa , startled , watch as Boq moves off , with Galinda .
Boq continues quietly , with deep emotion , to Galinda ... 87 BOQ ( CONT &apos;D ) That day .
When you asked me to ask Nessa out ... you said I &apos;d be your hero .
You gave me hope !
GALINDA But-- I give everyone hope .
Overcome , Boq bolts .
NESSA Boq !
Nessa moves to Galinda , upset-- NESSA ( CONT &apos;D ) What did you say to him ?
Galinda is tongue tied .
Elphaba sees her sister &apos;s distress-- ELPHABA I &apos;ll find him-- Elphaba rushes after Boq .
Galinda , twinged with guilt , kneels to face Nessa , and somehow repai r this .
GALINDA Nessa ... Nessa , upset , turns away from her .
Galinda spots : Avaric , in the crowd of Students .
She watches as Avaric glances over at Nessa , takes a step in her direction .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) There are other boys .
Who you may not have noticed .
Who &apos;ve noticed you .
NESSA ( a beat ) But-- they &apos;re not Boq .
69 69 EXT .
TRAIN STATION - TICKETING STRUCTURE - MOMENTS LATER Elphaba sees Boq inside this structure .
She enters-- 70 70 INT .
TRAIN STATION - TICKETING STRUCTURE - SAME ELPHABA Boq ... ?
He turns to her , in tears-- it makes her want to cry .
88 ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Oh , Boq .
BOQ I still have hope .
ELPHABA You shouldn &apos;t .
BOQ You don &apos;t know that !
Your dreams are coming true , why not mine ? !
TICKET BUYERS are staring at them ... Elphaba pulls him aside .
ELPHABA ( can &apos;t help herself ) Why can &apos;t you just love my sister ?
BOQ Because I can &apos;t !
( a beat ) You think I like seeing Nessa hurt ?
I hate hurting anyone , but I can &apos;t just change my feelings .
Could you change yours , f or Fiyero ?
ELPHABA What ? !
I-- I have no feelings for Fiyero !
He looks at her : suddenly alarmingly calm .
BOQ Oh , I &apos;m sorry , I misunderstood .
I thought we were being honest .
And before she can respond , he exits .
71 71 EXT .
TRAIN STATION - PLATFORM GALINDA Elphie !
ELPHABA Where &apos;s Nessa ?
GALINDA She left with your father .
She said to wish you safe travels .
( off Elphaba &apos;s concern ) She &apos;ll be fine , Elphie .
She &apos;ll have to manage without you .
We all will .
89 ELPHABA Oh , you &apos;ll barely notice I &apos;m gone .
You have Fiyero !
( trying to sound casual ) Where is he , anyway ?
Not that I expected him to say goodbye to me .
I mean , we barely know each other .
GALINDA I barely know him either , anymore !
He &apos;s-- different .
Distant , and moodified ... and he &apos;s been thinking , which really worries me .
Elphaba &apos;s trying to absorb this , as Galinda continues ... GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) It all started th at day Doctor Dillamond was fired .
I never knew Fiyero cared so much about that old Goat .
As Elphaba struggles to shove down the emotions this stirs in her ... Galinda suddenly waves excitedly-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Oh , there he is !
He did come !
Fiyero !
Over here , dearest !
Fiyero approaches , a poppy in his lapel .
The students who arrived with Galinda , now enjoying the MUSIC , wave to him .
FIYERO Elphaba .
I &apos;m happy for you .
GALINDA ( takes his arm ) Yes , we are both so happy for you !
FIYERO ( awkward pause , then ) I &apos;ve been thinking .
ELPHABA Yes , I-- heard .
FIYERO About Dillamond .
And that Lion Cub .
I think about that day a lot .
ELPHABA So do I. Galinda looks from one , to the other , then-- 90 GALINDA Oh , me too !
I think about it constantly .
Poor Doctor Dillamond-- it makes one want to take a stand .
In fact-- attention , everyone !
She signals , and the CHATTERING STUDENTS obediently go SILENT .
Galinda has zero idea what she &apos;s going to say , her desperation , added to her charm , equals : riveting .
GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) ( to the assembled throng ) I am-- changing my name .
FIYERO Your name ?
GALINDA Since Doctor Di llamond had his own , Goat-like way of pronouncifying my name-- in solidarity , and to express my ... uh ... outrage ...
Both Fiyero and Elphaba watch her in amazement as Galinda continues loudly , in a desperate bid for Fiyero &apos;s attention-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) ( a noble sacrifice ) I will henceforward be known-- no longer as &quot; Ga-linda &quot; ... but as simply : &quot; Glinda . &quot;
Elphaba &apos;s jaw drops in shock .
Then-- APPLAUSE from the St udents , as well as random TRAVELERS , who overheard .
SHENSHEN She &apos;s so good .
PFANNEE She so is .
In the very back of the station-- FIND Morrible : watching from afar , and registering the power Galinda has , to charm and affect a crowd .
Then , as she turns and moves off-- Galinda , now GLINDA , turns to Fiyero , hopeful ... but he &apos;s backing away-- FIYERO Very-- admirable , uh-- &quot; Glinda . &quot;
GLINDA Fiyero-- !
91 Fiyero awkwardly thrusts the poppy at a disconcerted Elphaba .
FIYERO Elphaba .
Good luck .
Elphaba takes the flower from him .
Neither knows what to say .
Then-- Fiyero rushes off , as the other students call out ( with admiration ) to Elphaba : VARIOUS STUDENTS Good fortune , Elphaba ! / Our best to the Wizard ! / Don &apos;t forget us !
They follow Fiyero .
Glinda , devastated , turns to Elphaba .
GLINDA There !
You see ?
Elphaba is flooded with both compassion and secret guilt-- ELPHABA Don &apos;t cry , Galinda ... GLINDA It &apos;s Glinda now !
Stupid idea , I don &apos;t even know what made me do it !
ELPHABA It doesn &apos;t matter what your name is , everyone loves you !
GLINDA I don &apos;t care !
I want him !
I don &apos;t even think he &apos;s perfect anymore , and I still want him !
( a revelation ) This must be what other people feel like .
How do they bear it ?
As WE HEAR-- CONDUCTOR ( OS . )
All aboard for the Emerald City Unlimited !
Glinda hastily wipes her tears-- GLINDA Come on , you &apos;ll miss your train !
As Elphaba steps onboard-- GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Oh !
I almost forgot !
92 Glinda hands her a small guidebook .
Elphaba reads the cover : ELPHABA &quot; If You Have Just One Day in The Emerald City . &quot;
She looks back at Glinda , visibly touched .
GLINDA Now don &apos;t you cry !
You &apos;re going to have the wonderfullest time .
The locomotive begins to slowly chug forward .
Glinda walks beside it , tears in her eyes , watching Elphaba .
A beat , then-- ELPHABA Come with me .
Glinda is now almost running be side the train .
GLINDA What ? !
ELPHABA To see the Emerald City , and meet the Wizard !
GLINDA But-- ELPHABA ( reaching out her hand ) Come on !
Glinda runs faster-- grabs Elphaba &apos;s hand , then terrified ; exhilarated , she leaps , and Elphaba pulls her onto the train .
72 72 INT .
TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - SAME The girls topple over , breathless ; LAUGHING ... As they get to their feet , brush each other off ... Glinda pulls her friend into a grateful hug-- SONG : &quot; ONE SHORT DAY &quot; 73 73 INT .
TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - LATER The girls sit next to each other , Glinda &apos;s perfect veneer now askew from her mad dash .
Both girls look out the window .
The train WHISTLE BLASTS and when Elphaba looks up-- Glinda suddenly turns green .
93 Elphaba stares at her in shock , then realizes : that it &apos;s the reflection of the Emerald City , shining through the windows !
They &apos;ve arrived !
TRAVELERS ONE SHORT DAY IN THE EMERALD CITY ...
The girls gaze out the window , marveling at the city , off in the distance , carved out of giant mounds of emerald .
TRAVELERS ( CONT &apos;D ) ONE SHORT DAY IN THE EMERALD CITY ... EMERALD CITY ... As the train pulls into the city , Elphaba and Glinda catch their breaths , and press their faces against the window , in happy anticipat ion-- they &apos;re so close to the Wizard now !

Elphaba and Glinda step off the train and take in the sparkling , glorious Downtown .
An array of well-dressed OZIANS bustle about merrily .
And all around , images of hot air balloons ... 75 75 SERIES OF QUICK CUTS : QUOXWOOD TREES , A DRESS SALON , A LIBRARY , A STREET VENDOR , A MUSEUM ELPHABA THERE ARE BUILDINGS TALL AS QUOXWOOD TREES GLINDA DRESS SALONS ELPHABA AND LIBRARIES GLINDA PALACES !

They arrive at the heart of the city .
It pulses with life .
The shops glitter , the people sparkle .
CRAZY RICH OZIANS stroll by .
And everywhere the girls look , they &apos;re seeing : SUCCESSFUL WOMEN-- ARTISTS , ENTREPRENEURS , MOTHERS .
Her e , you can be respected for who you are , or who you want to be .
Elphaba and Glinda take it all in , utterly mesmerized .
( CONT &apos;D ) BOTH I WANNA BE IN THIS HOI POLLOI ELPHABA SO I &apos;LL BE BACK FOR GOOD SOMEDAY GLINDA TO MAKE MY LIFE AND MAKE MY WAY BOTH BUT FOR TODAY WE &apos;LL WANDER AND ENJOY ...
They pass : A BEAUTY SALON .
The sign in the window reads : &quot; OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD ?
SEE US FIRST ! &quot;
Glinda looks at Elphaba , who s tarts to back away , but then ... 76 76 INT .
EMERALD CITY SALON / DRESS SHOP - DAY Using outlandish ( and humorous ) Ozian beauty treatments , HUMAN and ANIMAL BEAUTICIANS perform a makeover on our girls .
HUMAN BEAUTICIANS ONE SHORT DAY IN THE EMERALD CITY ONE SHORT DAY 95 TO HAVE A LIFETIME OF FUN ONE SHORT DAY ... 77 77 EXT .
EMERALD CITY - LATER The girls , now made-over , hit the street again-- ( Elphaba &apos;s had her nails done , and Glinda &apos;s had everything done . )
ELPHABA / GLINDA AND WE &apos;RE WARNING THE CITY : NOW THAT WE &apos;RE IN HERE YOU &apos;LL KNOW WE &apos;VE BEEN HERE BEFORE WE ARE DONE !
Elphaba studies the sights , fascinated ; Glinda studies ... the contents of Elphaba &apos;s envelope from the Wizard , and finds : GLINDA Free passes to Wiz-o-mania !
78 78 OMITTED 79 79 INT .
EMERALD CITY - WIZ-O-MANIA It &apos;s like a theme park &quot; ride , &quot; Ozian style .
Elphaba and Glinda are seated in a little car , ( we glimpse a car or two behind them , containing TOURISTS . )
The car travels our Girls up to the entrance of the ride .
They read the sign on the doors aloud , together-- ELPHABA / GLINDA &quot; Wizomania !
How our Wonderful Wizard Saved Oz : a Histor-istical Journey . &quot;
The doors swing open and they ride into a mysterious setting , with stage-effect fog .
A SINGER and CHORUS begin the show .
NARRATOR LONG LONG AGO LONG BEFORE WE CAN RECALL THERE LIVED HERE IN OZ THE MAGICAL WISE ONES CHORUS AHH AHH AHH THE MAGICAL WISE ONES Two mysterious figures emerge out of the fog ... NARRATOR THE WISEST OF THEM ALL !

BOTH WISE WOMEN IN A BOOK : ALL THE GRIMMERIE !
The Wise Women somehow make an oversized replica of the Grimmerie appear ...
BOTH WISE WOMEN AND WITH THIS MAGIC BOOK WE &apos;LL BLESS ALL OZ WITH MERRY- NESS !
The ride moves them into a new area , bright and colorful-- The Merry Land of Oz .
Smiling DANCERS , some dressed as ANIMALS , cavort .
ELPHABA ( whispers to Glinda ) Why aren &apos;t they using real Animals ?
Before Glinda can answer , the music and atmosphere turns somber-- NARRATOR BUT TIME TICKED EVER ONWARD , DAY BY DAY AND ALL THOSE WHO COULD READ IT PASSED AWAY The Wise Women , now perhaps costumed to look &quot; o ld &quot; , abruptly &quot; pass away &quot; by collapsing into a prone position .

EMERALD CITY - LATER Elphaba and Glinda glide along the streets , headed for the Wizard &apos;s Palace , up ahead , as they sing with the Crowd-- ELPHABA , GLINDA &amp; CROWD WHAT A WAY TO BE SEEING THE CITY ...
There &apos;s a huge GROUP OF HOPEFULS , all trying to see the Wizard , held back by a green gate , and a GATEKEEPER .
99 Elphaba steps forward , holds up her personal invitation-- The Crowd and the gate parts , revealing : THE PALACE STEPS , leading up to the entrance .
TWO GUARDS are stationed on balconies on either side of the entrance door .
As Elphaba and Glinda ascend these stairs ... ELPHABA / GLINDA WHERE SO MANY ROAM TO WE &apos;LL CALL IT HOME TOO AND THEN , JUST LIKE NOW WE CAN SAY : WE &apos;RE JUST TWO FRIENDS ... ELPHABA TWO GOO D FRIENDS ... GLINDA TWO BEST FRIENDS ... ELPHABA / GLINDA / CROWD SHARING ONE WONDERFUL ONE SHORT-- !

The Palace doors open !
ELPHABA / GLINDA / CROWD DAY !
83-84 83-84 OMITTED 85 85 INT .
WIZARD &apos;S PALACE - HALL OF GRANDIOSITY - NIGHT It &apos;s ( almost comically ) ornate .
Identically uniformed MONKEY GUARDS stand at attention against either wall .
More doors open , revealing CHISTERY , a more impressively uniformed Monkey , with a commanding , dynamic energy .
Chistery nods solemnly to Elphaba , and motions her to follow him , but then-- stops , noticing Glinda .
Elphaba takes Glinda &apos;s hand .
ELPHABA She &apos;s with me .
Chistery hesitates , then no ds again , giving his permission .
Glinda shoots Elphaba a look of intense gratitude , and the girls look at each other in excited anticipation , then follow Chistery , drinking in the opulence as they move into ... 100 Suddenly Elphaba stops walking , frozen with fear .
Glinda takes Elphaba &apos;s shoulders , looks into her eyes .
GLINDA Listen to me , Elphaba Thropp .
You can do this .
You can do anything !
She holds out her hand , Elphaba takes it , gratefully , and they go forward together , turn the corner-- then stop short .
86 86 INT .
WIZARD &apos;S PALACE - THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS AN ENORMOUS HEAD , ON A THRONE , looms over them .
The girls summon their courage , move closer , into this DARK SPACE-- Suddenly , the HEAD LIGHTS UP-- and SPEAKS !
OZ HEAD I.
AM .
OZ !
The girls , terrified , clutch each other-- GLINDA Oh , Elphie !
OZ HEAD I.
AM .
OZ !
The Great and Terrible .
Who are you and why do you seek me ?
ELPHABA Uhhh-- GLINDA ( petrified , to Elphaba ) Say something , say something-- OZ HEAD SAY SOM ETHING !
Elphaba bravely steps forward .
ELPHABA I am Elphaba .
Thropp .
Your Oz-ness .
And this is-- Suddenly the Head &quot; TURNS OFF , &quot; and from behind the curtain that surrounds it we hear : WIZARD ( OS . )
Oh , is that you , Elphaba ?
A MAN peeks out from behind the curtain .
This is the WIZARD !
Extraordinarily ordinary , with an inner motor-- like he &apos;s been elected , but is still trying to get your vote .
101 Now he greets Elphaba with genuine warmth , pumps her hand-- WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) Hope I didn &apos;t startle you-- it &apos;s so hard to make out people &apos;s faces when I &apos;m back there !
Elphaba stares , star struck .
WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) ( disarmingly sincere ) It &apos;s so good to meet you , Elphaba .
Everyone turns to Elphaba .
She &apos;s utterly overwhelmed , just trying to breathe .
The Wizard studies her , then-- WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) Well , what have we here ?
The Wizard tak es a coin out of Elphaba &apos;s ear , magician style .
It breaks the ice .
Elphaba laughs , Galinda claps .
The Wizard winks at Elphaba , presents the coin to her with a flourish .
WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) For you .
My special guest .
ELPHABA ( finally manages to speak ) Thank you , your Ozness .
WIZARD ( to Glinda ) And this is-- ?
He turns to Glinda , who performs an impressive curtsey .
GLINDA Glinda .
The &quot; GA &quot; is silent .
He sees them glancing nervously at the intimidating Oz Head .
WIZARD I know , it &apos;s a bit much .
But folks expect this sort of thing-- ( half sings , dances this ) --and ya gotta give the people what they want !
( re : the Oz Head ) And if you think that &apos;s big-- He claps his hands together , excited , turns to Elphaba ... 102 WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) Wait &apos;ll you see this !
Walk with me ...
He takes her arm , and as they walk-- LIGHTS COME UP ; we see : Chistery , along with the other ( Monkey ) Emerald Guards , standing at attention ... and now it &apos;s clear-- That what appeared to be a small dark room is actually enormous , and filled with various , eccentric inventions .
Elphaba stares , fascinated , at everything-- then notices : A life-sized portrait of the Wizard , 20 years younger .
The Wizard steers her toward an incredibly detailed , miniature model of the Land of Oz with a red brick road running through it .
WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) The Oz of Tomorrow !
As the girls , agog , move closer , charmed by the details-- WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) Girls-- this road will change the future of Oz .
Folks need direction .
Once it &apos;s built , they &apos;ll always know , if they just follow the road , it &apos;ll lead `em right to me !
GLINDA ELPHABA Look , there &apos;s Shiz !
And Munchkinland !
WIZARD And get a load of this !
The Wizard presses a button on an odd remote control dev ice and suddenly the model &apos;s red brick road changes to blue !
WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) Can &apos;t decide what color the bricks should be .
( to Elphaba ) Here , you try it-- Elphaba presses the button , and the blue bricks turn purple !
Elphaba , excited , presses the button again , then again , and the bricks turn orange , then yellow , then red ... GLINDA Wait , go back one ...
The Wizard presses the button , now the bricks are yellow .
103 WIZARD Really ?
The yellow ?
GLINDA It just says &quot; road &quot; to me .
( looking closer ) There &apos;s the palace !
And-- oh , Elphie , look !
Glinda points-- and we , along with Elphaba , see : A perfect replica of the Palace .
The girls peer through a tiny window .
THEIR POV : In the miniature throne room , a tiny replica of the Wizard himself !
WIZARD Oh !
Almost forgot-- The Wizard reaches into his pocket , and , to Elphaba &apos;s utter amazement , holds out a tiny replica of ... herself .
Elphaba looks at it , then at him-- speechless .
WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) I had it made special-- The Wizard hands Elphaba the replica / figurine .
WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) You keep that .
And someday , we &apos;ll put it inside there , next to mine .
And you &apos;ll call this place ... your home .
It &apos;s like Elphaba has waited her entire life to hear those words .
She stares down at the tiny Elphaba in her palm ... ELPHABA ( very softly , to herself ) It &apos;s gr een .
Then , acutely embarrassed to have spoken those words aloud , she hastily turns away from them all , shoving the little figurine into her pocket .
Then-- feels something in there .
Elphaba quietly inches Doctor Dillamond &apos;s spectacles out of her pocket .
She stares down at them , as-- WE HEAR ... WIZARD Well- it doesn &apos;t have to be .
She just stares down at the Goat &apos;s spectacles .
The Wizard speaks softly , just to her ... 104 WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) Is that-- your heart &apos;s desire ?
Elphaba places the spectacles back in her pocket , and turns , coming face to face with him-- ELPHABA ( with great conviction ) No .
My heart &apos;s desire is for you to help the Animals .
GLINDA But-- Elphie-- ( takes her aside ) Are you sure you don &apos;t want to ask for something more personal , like-- But Elphaba cuts her off , continues to the Wizard-- ELPHABA Something bad is happen ing to them .
They need you .
WIZARD ( after a beat ) I thought you might say that .
It &apos;s the darndest thing , it &apos;s almost like-- I already know you .
ELPHABA ( flooded with relief ) Oh , your Ozness-- I knew you &apos;d understand !
That makes me so happy .
WIZARD Well , that &apos;s what I love best .
Making people happy .
SONG : &quot; A SENTIMENTAL MAN &quot; WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) ( sings , guileless ; humble ) I AM A SENTIMENTAL MAN WHO ALWAYS LONGED TO BE A FATHER THAT &apos;S WHY I DO THE BEST I CAN TO TREAT EACH CITIZEN OF OZ AS SON-- ( beams at Elphaba ) OR DAUGHTER-- !
SO ELPHABA , I &apos;D LIKE TO RAISE YOU HIGH &apos; CUZ I THINK EV &apos;RYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY Elphaba is now at ease , drinking in his every word ... 105 WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) AND HELPING YOU WITH YOUR ASCENT ALLOWS ME TO FEEL SO PARENTAL FOR I AM-- A SENTIMENTAL MAN ... As the Wizard has been singing , he &apos;s led them back to the Oz Head .
And we notice , beneath the enormous head : drapes-- At the Wizard &apos;s signal , Chistery opens the drapes , revealing ... A plain wooden bookstand .
On it : an impossibly old , worn book .
And we hear the GRIMMERIE THEME ...
Suddenly , from behind the drapes , steps ... ELPHABA Madame Morrible !
MORRIBLE Oh Dearie , I couldn &apos;t miss your big moment .
( noticing Glinda , dryly ) Neither could you , I see .
GLINDA I don &apos;t believe it .
Is that ... ?
ELPHABA / GLINDA The Grimmerie ... ?
Both Elphaba and Glinda move toward it , as if magnetized ... MORRIBLE Yes .
Our Ancient Book of Wisdom , Thaumaturgy and Enchantmen ts .
GLINDA ( whispers ) Can I touch it ?
MORRIBLE ( whispers ) No .
The Wizard starts to lead Elphaba towards it then-- stops-- WIZARD Wait .
( to Morrible ) She may not be ready .
Casting a spell from the Grimmerie-- that &apos;s a tall order !
I should know !
Elphaba freezes ... cast a spell ?
Where would she even start ?
106 MORRIBLE You &apos;re right .
We mustn &apos;t rush her .
Perhaps today has been too overwhelming ... Elphaba , her future at stake , wills herself to say ... ELPHABA No .
Let me prove myself ...
Please .
At least , let me try !
She waits , tries to breathe .
The Wizard seems to be weighing this .
Then he looks over to Morrible ; still uncertain .
But-- Morrible nods .
Elphaba moves closer and closer to the book ... and then ...
It opens itself to her .
Elphaba &apos;s stunned .
This mystical , timeworn entity seems to recognize her ; wants to be read-- by her .
She looks back at Glinda , whose eyes are wide .
The Wizard and Morrible are equally stunned .
The Wizard turns to Elphaba-- WIZARD So .
Which spell will you start with ?
MORRIBLE Well , we &apos;ve been working on levitation-- WIZARD Have you ?
You know , Chistery , here-- ( he motions to Chistery ) You &apos;ve met Chistery , leader of my Emerald Guards ?
Elphaba meets Chistery &apos;s penetrating gaze , is about to speak to him .
But the Wizard pulls Elphaba aside , speaks low-- WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) He &apos;d never admit it ; hates to talk about himself-- but he watches the birds so longingly every morning-- ELPHABA Oh .
But-- how could I-- ever-- GLINDA ( O.S. )
Elphie-- ?
Look !
107 They turn , Glinda is pointing in amazement at The Grimmerie .
Its pages are turning by themselves , a whirl of indecipherable symbols .
Until ... they stop at : A PAGE WITH A DRAWING OF WINGS .
Elphaba moves to it , gently touches the wings , then the mysterious symbols , entranced ... ELPHABA Are these-- words ?
MORRIBLE A lost language ... our lost language of spells .
As Elphaba moves closer to the Grimmerie-- MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Don &apos;t be discouraged if you can &apos;t decipherate it , Dearie , I myself can only read a word or two , and that took years and years of-- Elphaba , transfixed , BEGINS TO CHANT , haltingly at first-- ELPHABA Ah-- tay ... ?
Tah ... tay ?
MORRIBLE ( can barely speak ) Praise Oz !
GLINDA ( in awe ) Oh , Elphie ...
The Wizard and Morrible take each others hands , thrilled .
Glinda stares ; proud of her friend ( but also-- envious ) .
And now Elphaba CHANTS , fluently , feverishly-- as the symbols in the Grimmerie begin to glo w . WIZARD ( whispering to Morrible ) She can read it !
MORRIBLE What did I tell you ?
The CHANTING seems to emanate from so deep inside her that the Wizard , Morrible , and Glinda involuntarily back away , stunned by this wild , fierce power she &apos;s channeling .
108 But Elphaba becomes aware of ... is that MOANING-- ?
Then suddenly : A YELP OF PAIN !
Elphaba turns , startled , to see Chistery ; he &apos;s twitching ... ELPHABA Chistery !
Are you all right ?
Chistery tears frantically at his waistcoat ; MOANS .
Elphaba starts towards him , but Morrible guides her back ... MORRIBLE It &apos;s just the transition , Dearie ... GLINDA ( to Elphaba ) It &apos;s just the transition .
ELPHABA But it &apos;s hurting him !
Elphaba breaks free-- rushes to Chistery-- ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Chistery , what &apos;s wrong ?
Chistery GROANS , writhing , then his waistcoat rips open .
Morrible and the Wizard are now studying Chistery , like two scientists ; Glinda is silent , frozen .
Then Elphaba GASPS as WINGS BURST OUT OF CHISTERY &apos;S BACK .
As his new wings flap , Chistery rises off the ground for a moment , before falling back down .
WIZARD Glory-osky !
GLIND A You ... did it , you actually ... ELPHABA He &apos;s in pain-- !
( to Morrible , desperate ) Quick , how do I reverse it ?
MORRIBLE Reverse it ?
A spell from The Grimmerie can never be reversed , did we not cover that-- ?
THE SOUND OF FLAPPING WINGS drowns her out .
Elphaba rushes past her , towards the SOUND ... 87 87 OMITTED 109 88 88 INT .
WIZARD &apos;S PALACE - HALL OF GRANDIOSITY - SAME ... where she discovers : the other Monkey Guards struggling , writhing-- SPROUTING WINGS .
ELPHABA Oh no ... no ... !
Unable to control their new wings , the Monkeys start to zoom into the air , careening like bats with no radar .
Elphaba backs away , horrified .
The Wizard , Morrible , and Glinda appear , staring , amazed .
The Wizard and Morrible turn to each other-- unable to hide their joy .
MORRIBLE ( to the Wizard ) I knew it !
I knew she had the power , I told you !
Glinda looks at Elphaba , manages to speak-- GLINDA That was ... astoundifying !
WIZARD ( to Morrible ) It &apos;s what we hoped for !
Eyes in the skies !
MORRIBLE Yes , they &apos;ll make perfect spies !
Elphaba hears this , but-- can &apos;t make sense of it-- ELPHABA Spies ? ? !
The Wizard turns to Elphaba , and leads her back into ... 88A 88A INT .
WIZARD &apos;S PALACE - THRONE ROOM WIZARD You &apos;re right .
That &apos;s a harsh word .
How about ... scouts ?
They &apos;ll fly around Oz-- and report back any seditious Animal activity !
Elphaba starts to put the pieces together .
ELPHABA Seditious Animal activity ?
What are you ... ?
110 GLINDA I &apos;m sure the Wizard has a good reason ... Elphaba stares at the Wizard , realizing ... ELPHABA It &apos;s-- you .
You &apos;re behind it all .
People , turning against the Animals ... it &apos;s because of you .
MORRIBLE We &apos;re doing this to keep people safe .
All of Oz will benefit .
ELPHABA ( to Morrible , realizing ) You &apos;ve known all along ... from the moment you met me .
Morrible immediately tries to reassure her-- MORRIBLE You w ill benefit , too , Dearie .
You must trust me-- WIZARD Elphaba ... when I first got here , there was discord and discontent-- and back where I come from , everyone knows the best way to bring folks together is-- give them a really good enemy .
Elphaba stares at both of them , seeing them with new eyes , and then , almost against her will , she starts to understand .
That the two people she most admires-- used h er .
ELPHABA ( to herself ) But-- if you wanted spies ... why not just make them yourself ?
Elphaba opens the Grimmerie , then turns the book around to show him the page of indecipherable symbols .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Read it .
Cast a spell .
Glinda GASPS at Elphaba &apos;s insolence .
MORRIBLE Miss Elphaba , you are talking to the Wizard of Oz !
111 ELPHABA ( to the Wizard ) You can &apos;t read this book at all , can you ?
( off his silence ) CAN YOU ? !
The Wizard walks slowly towards Elphaba , speaking gently to her , as if calming a spooked horse ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) That &apos;s why you need spies .
And cages ... and an enemy .
( a revelation ) You have no real power .
The Wizard looks at Elphaba .
No pretense .
No guile .
WIZARD Exactly .
That &apos;s why I need you .
She looks back at him , hor rified , everything she &apos;s ever been taught , ever believed-- crumbling-- MORRIBLE Think of your future , Dearie !
The Wizard and Morrible move closer and closer to her-- and Elphaba &apos;s eyes darken with rage .
ELPHABA Stay back !
Elphaba &apos;s eyes darken with rage .
Startled , Chistery , along with the two other Monkey Guards , flaps up to the ceiling-- Elphaba stares up at Chistery-- clearly frightened , and in pain .
She can HEAR THE BEATING OF THE OTHER MONKEYS &apos; WING , from out in the hall .
All of it-- her doing .
The Wizard catches Glinda &apos;s eye-- Reason with her !
GLINDA Elphie , listen to them .
Please .
WIZARD That &apos;s good advice , young lady .
He follows Elphaba &apos;s eyes : UP TO THE MONKEYS ... WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) If you can do this , first time out ... why , there &apos;s no telling how far you can go !
112 Elphaba has stopped backing away .
WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) And I meant every word , about you having a home here .
She &apos;s focused on the Wizard with every fiber of her being .
Is he persuading her ?
WIZARD ( CONT &apos;D ) It &apos;ll be you , and me , and , hey-- if it makes you happy-- maybe even your friend here-- ?
Glinda &apos;s jaw drops .
Her dream , coming true ?
GLINDA Really ?
WIZARD Why not ?
( sings ) THE TWO OF YOU , IT &apos;S TIME I RAISED YOU HIGH THE TIME H AS COME FOR YOU TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO-- ELPHABA NO !
Elphaba , still holding the Grimmerie-- runs out !
MORRIBLE Elphaba-- !
The Wizard looks at Morrible in horror , who then turns to Glinda , cold as ice-- MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) You want to do yourself some good ?
Get her back !
Glinda , scared , nods , then-- runs out .
The door SLAMS .
88B 88B INT .
WIZARD &apos;S PALACE - HALL OF GRANDIOSITY - CONTINUOUS Morrible enters the hall , addresses the Monkeys-- MORRIBLE If you want to do yourselves some good , and keep your families safe-- you &apos;ll stay loyal to our Wizard !
The Monkeys rise into the air ... 113 MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Don &apos;t let her get away ... !
At that , the Monkeys explode out of every window , doorway , and skylight .
89 89 INT .
WIZARD &apos;S PALACE - EMERALD HALLWAY - SAME Elphaba runs down a hallway made completely of emeralds as Glinda chases after her-- GLINDA Elphie , wait ! !
Elphaba ignores her , tries various doors along the way-- all locked .
Elphaba keeps running , Glinda is falling behind .
The shadows of flying Monkeys dart across the semi- translucent , emerald walls .
Shit &apos;s getting real .
GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Elphaba-- !
Please , just-- The SCREECHING of the Monkeys gets LOUDER , comes closer-- then a Monkey &apos;s arm grabs at Elphaba .
Glinda screams-- Elphaba barely escapes its grasp , then runs down the hall and skids around a corner-- where the hall comes to an abrupt stop .
She bangs the dead end of the hallway in frustration , and a narrow , hidden door springs open-- she slips through-- ON GLINDA : catching up to Elphaba , the Monkeys FLYING towards her , gaining on her ... Glinda skids around the same corner , hits the same dead end , when suddenly , a green hand appears and yanks her through the secret door , and SLAM !
The door shuts behind her .
90 90 INT .
WIZARD &apos;S PALACE - THRONE ROOM / CONTROL ROOM - SAME The Wizard stands behind the curtain , frantically pulls some levers , and the Oz head comes to life-- OZ HEAD VOICE GUARDS !
GUARDS !
The human Guards race into the Throne Room and stand at attention .
114 91 91 INT .
WIZARD &apos;S PALACE - DARKENED ROOM - SAME Elphaba LOCKS the door behind Glinda .
It &apos;s dark , except for the moonlight shining through a skylight in the roof .
The girls STRUGGLE TO CATCH THEIR BREATH .
GALINDA Where are we ?
Elphie , please , just-- WIZARD &apos;S OZ HEAD VOICE ( O.S. )
Guards !
There &apos;s a fugitive at large in the palace !
Bring her to me !
GLINDA Elphie .
Listen to me-- But Elphaba is staring at a piece of colorful fabric in the distance , illu minated by the moonlight ... Elphaba steps closer , and realizes-- ELPHABA Glinda , look .
Glinda follows Elphaba &apos;s gaze , GASPS .
Suddenly , we see what they do ...
It &apos;s the Wizard &apos;s giant hot air balloon , deflated , hanging from the ceiling by its basket .
Just then , the GUARDS BANG loudly against the door .
GUARD ( O.S. )
Open up ! !
The girls look at each other .
Where can they go ?
They run towards the balloon , grabbing onto its tethers , pulling themselves up .
They struggle as they climb up the fabric , using decorative hooks , webbing , and ropes to yank themselves higher .
Suddenly-- The Guards smash through the door with a battering ram !
Elphaba and Glinda climb faster , finally reaching the wicker basket hanging from the ceiling .
They struggle to climb into it , then look down to see : The guards have started to climb the balloon .
Glinda and Elphaba look around , desperate ... Elphaba grabs for a sand-bag inside the basket , to throw at them , accidentally triggering the burner mechanism !
115 The balloon starts to rise-- to the very top of the palace .
92 92 INT .
WIZARD &apos;S PALACE - LOWER ATTIC - SAME TIME Elphaba and Glinda scramble from the balloon &apos;s basket onto stairs that lead into An attic space , cluttered with cobwebs and various dust- covered objects from the Wizard &apos;s carny past : a unicycle , a set of juggling clubs , a push-cart labeled &quot; Potions N &apos; Potables &quot; with an old broom on top of it .
Elphaba swiftly pulls a rope loose , and the balloon plummets down , onto the Guards , below .
Elphaba pushes the cart against the door , barricading it , while Glinda paces , fueled with adrenaline and fear .
GLINDA Oh , this is not , not , not good ...
But Elphaba is ignoring her .
She &apos;s staring at the Wizard &apos;s possessions , and we now see that many of them are rudimentary prototypes of military uniforms , fantastical inventions , and symbols of power we have seen throughout Oz .
Symbols that Elphaba o nce revered , now revealed to be so fake , so empty ... GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Why couldn &apos;t you stay calm for once ? !
Instead of flying off the handle-- ?
SONG : &quot; DEFYING GRAVITY &quot; GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) I HOPE YOU &apos;RE HAPPY I HOPE YOU &apos;RE HAPPY NOW I HOPE YOU &apos;RE HAPPY HOW YOU HURT YOUR CAUSE FOREVER I HOPE YOU THINK YOU &apos;RE CLEVER Elphaba whirls on her , equally furious-- ELPHABA I HOPE YOU &apos;RE HAPPY I HOPE YOU &apos;RE HAPPY TOO I HOPE YOU &apos;RE PROUD HOW YOU WOULD GROVEL IN SUBMISSION TO FEED YOUR OWN AMBITION BOTH ( glaring at each other ) SO THOUGH I CAN &apos;T <unk> HOW I HOPE YOU &apos;RE HAPPY RIGHT <unk> <unk> Suddenly both break off , <unk> MORRIBLE &apos;S VOICE <unk> of Oz !

Glinda , shaken by Morrible &apos;s <unk> <unk> , turns to her friend-- GLINDA Don &apos;t be afraid .
ELPHABA ( after a beat ) I &apos;m not .
It &apos;s the Wizard who should be afraid .
Of me !
( then ) I &apos;ve got the book .
And I &apos;m going to tell everyone the <unk> .
Glinda sees her quiet ; <unk> , takes this as an <unk> GLINDA Elphaba .

Elphaba &apos;s not listening , she &apos;s <unk> ; higher and higher-- the stairway starts trembling ever so <unk> is it because the steps are <unk> ?
Or <unk> ELPHABA I &apos;M THROUGH <unk> <unk> &apos; CAUSE SOMEONE <unk> THEY &apos;RE SO SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE BUT TILL I TRY , I &apos;LL NEVER KNOW TOO LONG I &apos;VE BEEN <unk> OF <unk> LOVE I <unk> I &apos;VE LOST <unk> WELL , IF THAT &apos;S LOVE IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A <unk> I &apos;D <unk> <unk> DEFYING GRAVITY <unk> ME <unk> I &apos;M DEFYING GRAVITY AND YOU CAN &apos;T PULL ME DOWN ... Elphaba reaches ... 95 95 INT .
WIZARD &apos;S PALACE - UPPER ATTIC - SAME It &apos;s really just a platform , with a window , covered by a <unk> black drape .
Elphaba kneels , opens the Grimmerie ... GLINDA ( O.S. )

Glinda reaches her .
Elphaba ignores her , STARTS TO <unk> GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Not that horrendible <unk> spell ! ?
ELPHABA How else do we get out of here ? !

Where are your wings ?
Maybe you &apos;re not as powerful as you-- Glinda stops , staring at something behind Elphaba , in <unk> GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) <unk> you are ... ELPHABA Glinda ... ?
What is it ... ?
Glinda can &apos;t speak , she &apos;s staring at whatever new , <unk> entity is <unk> above Elphaba , just behind her head .
Elphaba turns ... and sees ... A BROOM floating in the air .
<unk> , purposefully ... it floats closer ... her <unk> , coming towards her .
Elphaba and Glinda HEAR POUNDING on the door <unk> <unk> GUARD 1 ( OS . )
Open up !
In the name of the Wizard !
And the Broom snaps itself , as if magnetized , into her hand !
Elphaba stares at it , then rushes to the window , rips away the drape , throws it open-- A <unk> OF WIND BLOWS IN .
ELPHABA Quick !
Get on !
Glinda stares at her , speechless .
Elphaba climbs out onto the window <unk> , turns back to Glinda-- ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Come with me .
Think of what we could do-- together .

Glinda stares at her , and for one glorious moment , it feels ... <unk> !
Until she realizes : it &apos;s not .
She can &apos;t .
And Elphaba sees her friend realize this ... and is forced to <unk> that dream .
She <unk> the Broom tighter .
GLINDA Elphie , you &apos;re trembling .

Glinda picks up the drape , and wraps it around her shoulders .
It &apos;s all she can give her now .

And standing there , against the sky , cloaked in black , with her pointy black hat and Broom , Elphaba becomes , before our <unk> The Wicked Witch of The West .
