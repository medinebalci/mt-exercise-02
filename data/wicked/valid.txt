ANGLE ON : A Messenger taps Glinda &apos;s proclamation into an Ozian-style telegraph machine as-- GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) The liquidation occurred at the thirteenth hour , the direct result of a bucket of water thrown by a female child .
Yes , the Wicked Witch of the West ... is dead .
The crowd EXPLODES : embracing , dancing , CELEBRATING ... !
MAN IN THE CROWD NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED WOMAN IN THE CROWD NO ONE CRIES : &quot; THEY WON &apos;T RETURN ! &quot;

The townspeople gather around Glinda .
TOWNSPEOPLE YES , GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED &apos;S LIVES ARE LONELY GOODNESS KNOWS THE WICKED CRY ALONE NOTHING GROWS FOR THE WICKED THEY REAP ONLY WHAT THEY &apos;VE SOWN ... A GIRL IN THE CROWD calls out to Glinda-- GIRL IN THE CROW D But Miss Glinda , why does Wickedness happen ?
GLINDA That &apos;s a good question .
One that many people find confusifying : Are people born Wicked ?
Or do they have Wickedness thrust upon them ?
After all , she had a childhood .
She had a father , who , by the way , had been appointed the Governor of Munchkinland ... 7-10 7-10 OMITTED 11 11 INT .
GOVERNOR &apos;S MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT &#91; FLASHBACK &#93; GOVERNOR THROPP , a somber looking man in a suit , calls out-- GOVERNOR THROPP I &apos;m off to the Assembly , dear !
5 His voice ECHOES in the large , ornate house .
GLINDA ( V.O. )
And she had a mother .
As so many do ... A hauntingly beautiful woman appears beside Governor Thropp .
This is his wife-- MRS. THROPP .
GOVERNOR THROPP HOW I HATE TO GO AND LEAVE YOU LONELY MRS. THROPP THAT &apos;S ALRIGHT -- IT &apos;S ONLY JUST ONE NIGHT GOVERNOR THROPP BUT KNOW THAT YOU &apos;RE HERE IN MY HEART WHILE I &apos;M OUT OF YOUR SIGHT ... GLINDA ( V.O. )
Like every fa mily ... they had their secrets .
Governor Thropp kisses his wife goodbye .
She shuts the front door behind him .
Her expression changes .
She turns , we FOLLOW HER through the house ... Down the hall ... To the back door , where she pulls HER LOVER inside .
The Lover ( who we only see from behind or in shadows ) takes a swig from a small green bottle , then offers it to her-- THE LOVER HAVE ANOTHER DRINK , MY DARK-EYED BEAUTY I &apos;VE GOT ONE MORE NIGHT LEFT , HERE IN TOWN SO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF GREEN ELIXIR AND WE &apos;LL HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE MIXER HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SWALLOW , LITTLE LADY , AND FOLLOW ME DOWN ...
They kiss-- the bottle slips from her hand .
As she pulls him up the stairs , WE LINGER ON THE GREEN BOTTLE , lying there ... GLINDA ( V.O. )
And one thing led to another ... as it so often does .
12-14 12-14 OMITTED 15 15 INT .
GOVERNOR &apos;S MANSION - HALLWAY &amp; BEDROOM - DAY CLOSE ON : Mrs. Thropp grabbing the bedsheets ... 6 GLINDA ( V.O. )
But from the moment the witch was born she was ... well , different .
CLOSE ON : ENORMOUS BEAR PAWS , RUNNING .
Is someone being attacked ?
But then , the bear paws run ... up a staircase .
DULCIBEAR ( PRE-LAP ) IT &apos;S COMING ... 16 16 INT .
GOVERNOR &apos;S MANSION - BEDROOM - DAY &#91; 9 MONTHS LATER &#93; The bear opens the door , carrying a cauldron and wearing a nursemaid &apos;s uniform .
This is DULCIBEAR .
GOVERNOR THROPP NOW ?
We hear a SCREAM and REVEAL Mrs. Thropp is in labor .
DULCIBEAR THE BABY &apos;S COMING ...
GOVERNOR THROPP AND HOW !
Governor Thropp dabs his wife &apos;s brow lovingly as Dulcibear pours boiling water over some towels and hands one to-- A FEMALE WOLF DOCTOR .
The Wolf Doctor holds an Ozian stethosco pe to Mrs. Thropp &apos;s pregnant belly .
WOLF DOCTOR I SEE A NOSE ...
GOVERNOR THROPP I SEE A CURL ... DULCIBEAR / GOVERNOR THROPP IT &apos;S A HEALTHY PERFECT LOVELY LITTLE ... DULCIBEAR Ohhhhh !
GOVERNOR THROPP Sweet Oz !
MRS. THROPP What is it , what &apos;s wrong ?
Governor Thropp stares at the baby in shocked disbelief .
DULCIBEAR HOW CAN IT BE ?
7 GOVERNOR THROPP WHAT DOES IT MEAN ?
DULCIBEAR IT &apos;S UNCANNY !
GOVERNOR THROPP ( devastated ) IT &apos;S OBSCENE !
GOVERNOR THROPP / WOLF DOCTOR LIKE A FROGGY , FERNY CABBAGE THE BABY IS UNNATURALLY ...
Governor Thropp looks from the baby to his wife , hurt and betrayed .
GOVERNOR THROPP ( a hushed accusation ) GREEN .
As Mrs. Thropp sees her BABY , we REVEAL : the baby is green .
Dulcibear picks up the baby and swaddles it lovingly .
She goes to hand the baby to Mrs. Thropp when-- GOVERNOR THROPP ( CONT &apos;D ) Take it away .
Dulcibear hesitates .
Suddenly the green baby lets out a WAIL , and-- BAM !
All the objects in the room fly into the air and stick to the ceiling and walls , as if gravity has pulled them in all directions .
Everyone looks around , stunned .
Governor Thropp stares at the green baby , clearly the source of this perversion of physics .
GOVERNOR THROPP ( CONT &apos;D ) Take it away-- !
Dulcibear hurries out with the baby , cradling it protectively in her arms .
The baby calms .
As they exit , we glimpse : the objects in the room behind them tumble back to earth .
TRANSITION : CLOSE ON a pop-up book , held by a pair of small green hands .
17 17 EXT .
GOVERNOR &apos;S MANSION - FRONT LAWN - DAY &#91; FLASHBACK &#93; FIND LITTLE ELPHABA ( 7 ) reading her book on the lawn .
Next to her , Dulcibear plays peekaboo with TODDLER NESSAROSE , &quot; NESSA &quot; , ( Elphaba &apos;s 4 year old sister , with eyes that could melt your heart .
She &apos;s in an Ozian-style wheelchair ) .
8 GOVERNOR THROPP ( O.S. )
Dulcibear !
Across the lawn , DIGNITARIES arrive , greeting the Governor .
DULCIBEAR Coming , Governor !
( to Elphaba ) Little One-- Little Elphaba looks up from her book-- DULCIBEAR ( CONT &apos;D ) Watch baby Nessa just a clock tick-- As Dulcibear lumbers off to assist the Governor , we hear : TAUNTING KIDS ( O.S. )
Yeah , watch your sister , El-pha-ba !
Little Elphaba looks over to the gate to the lawn , where so me MEAN KIDS have gathered-- MEAN KID Just don &apos;t let her see how ugly you are !
The Kids LAUGH .
Elphaba yells back , like it &apos;s a great burn-- LITTLE ELPHABA She already knows !
Confident she got the last word , Little Elphaba turns to her baby sister ... whose big eyes now look frightened-- LITTLE ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Oh , Nessarose , don &apos;t you worry-- ( whispers ) I &apos;m right here .
I always will be .
Elphaba takes Nessa &apos;s t iny hand into her own green hand , looks into her eyes , smiles .
Comforted , Nessa smiles back .
LITTLE ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Now .
You want to see something wonderful ... ?
( opening her pop-up book ) This is all about the Wizard .
Do you know how he got here ?
Toddler Nessa shakes her head no , eyes wide-- LITTLE ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) From the sky !
In a balloon !
See ?
9 We see a pop-up balloon , as Little Elphaba continues ... LITTLE ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Then he built a city made of emeralds , `cause he loves emeralds .
Even though they &apos;re green .
And Nessa , if you get to meet him ?
( whispers ) He grants your heart &apos;s desire !
PING !
A single pebble hits the pop up book-- when Elphaba turns to where it came from , WE HEAR the Kids , chanting-- KIDS Elphaba Thropp , green on top .
Someone run and tell her That everyon e can smell her ...
The kids throw more pebbles .
Toddler Nessa BURSTS INTO TEARS .
Little Elphaba leaps to her feet , glaring at the Kids , and suddenly-- the pebbles and dirt swirl up from the ground and pummel the shocked kids .
They SCREAM and run away .
GOVERNOR THROPP ( O.S. )
What have you done this time ? !
Elphaba turns to see her father rush over with Dulcibear .
GOVERNOR THROPP ( CONT &apos;D ) ( to Elphaba ) Now you &apos;ve made your sister cry !
He scoops up Toddler Nessa , and carries her off .
Elphaba looks down at her pop-up book in the dirt .
Dulcibear picks it up and dusts it off , giving it back to her tenderly .
Elphaba opens it and a pop-up Wizard comes out of his palace , smiling , his little pop-up hand reaching out ... to her .
GLINDA ( PRE-LAP ) So you see ... it couldn &apos;t have been easy .
18 18 EXT .
MUNCHKINLAND - TOWN CENTER - MORNING The crowd parts , making way for a HUGE EFFIGY OF ELPHABA .
It &apos;s wheeled towards Glinda , bearing down on her ...
CROWD NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED NOW AT LAST , SHE &apos;S DEAD AND GONE An OZIAN ZEALOT lights a stick and hands it to Glinda to do the honors .
10 Glinda &apos;s smile tightens for a split second , but then ... she lights the EFFIGY , which ignites in a WHOOSH of flames !
CROWD ( CONT &apos;D ) GLINDA ( concerned ) NOW AT LAST THERE &apos;S JOY THROUGHOUT THE LAND GOODNESS KNOWS ... AND GOODNESS KNOWS ... WE KNOW WHAT GOODNESS IS AHH GOODNESS KNOWS ...
THE WICKED DIE ALONE ... SHE DIED ALONE ... WOE TO THOSE ( WOE TO THOSE ) WHO SPURN WHAT GOODNESSES THEY ARE SHOWN ... NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED !
GOOD NEWS !
NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED !
GOOD NEWS !
NO ONE MOURNS THE ... ALL WICKED !
WICKED !
WICKED !
A beat .
Glinda turns away from the burning effigy .
GLINDA Well .
As you can imagine , I have much to attend to , what with the Wizard &apos;s unexpected departure , so-- Glinda steps back onto the Bubble &apos;s platform , and now we see that it is a bubble-powered machine : mechanical , not magical .
GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) If there are no further q uestions-- The Bubble &quot; rebubbles &quot; itself over her with a quick swoop .
Glinda is about to float away when suddenly A VOICE IN THE CROWD yells out-- VOICE IN THE CROWD Glinda !
Is it true you were her friend ?
Glinda freezes , thrown .
From inside her Bubble , Glinda stares at the burning effigy .
For a moment , the flames take her to a memory ... a feeling ... -- QUICK FLASH TO : A younger Glinda sits , arm in arm , with someone dressed in black , with black hair , whose face we can &apos;t see .
11 There &apos;s no sound but the CRACKLE and POP of a fire in a fireplace .
Glinda laughs until she cries , then-- leans closer to this person , and whispers something .
BACK TO SCENE : Glinda stares into the burning effigy then turns back to the crowd-- GLINDA Friend ?
I mean ...
I knew her .
RIPPLES OF SHOCK move through the Crowd below ... GLINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) That is , our paths did cross .
At school ...
But you must understand , it was ... a long time ago ... OFF Glinda , remembering ... and suddenly , we &apos;re on a boat , with her , traveling down a RIVER , towards : 18A 18A EXT .
SHIZ UNIVERSITY - RIVER ARCH The breathtaking arched gateway to Shiz University .
We hear the OPENING CHORDS the Shiz University Oz-ma Mater .
SONG : &quot; DEAR OLD SHIZ &quot; - INSTRUMENTAL INTRO 19 19 EXT .
SHIZ UNIVERSITY - ENTRANCE COURTYARD - DAY Pink suitcases of every size and shape hit the ground , as Glinda ( or as she was known back then , &quot; GALINDA &quot; ) strides through the impressive gates , clad in a Shiz University blazer , that she has styled in her own fashion forward , Galinda way .
She &apos;s flanked by her ADORING PARENTS .
As Galinda strides by , VARIOUS STUDENTS and PARENTS , notice her , thinking they know her-- or just wanting to .
They smil e as she passes , and Galinda ( being Galinda ) smiles back , waving , used to this ... Galinda stops and turns to her parents , flinging open her arms and pulling them into a hug .
After a long beat , she gently extricates herself .
As her tearful parents reluctantly start to go , she calls out-- GALINDA Remember , it &apos;s not goodbye , it &apos;s farewell .
Her Parents immediately rush back , clinging to her again .
This time she &apos;s getting squished , and over it ... 12 GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) Now it &apos;s goodbye .
Her parents nod , and with one last kiss , they back away-- GALINDA &apos;S PARENTS Goodbye , precious ! / We love you !
Glinda notices : a handkerchief , floating beside her ?
She turns , puzzled , and sees ... AN EARNEST YOUNG MUNCHKIN STUDENT , ( BOQ ) offering it to her .
She takes it , dabs her eyes ... GALINDA ( to Boq , genuine ) They &apos;re going to miss me so much .
BOQ ( overcomes his shyness ) I &apos;m Boq .
From Munchkinland .
And I know we don &apos;t know each other , but-- GALINDA You know what I believe , Bick ?
BOQ Boq .
I mean-- what .
GALINDA That strangers ... are just people I &apos;ve never met .
He takes this in , slightly stumped , but she &apos;s looking into his eyes , and he &apos;s blown away , about to say more , when-- PFANNEE / SHENSHEN ( O.S. )
GALINDA ! !
Two excited students , PFANNEE and SHENSHEN , rush up to Galinda .
PFANNEE It &apos;s Pfannee !
SHENSHEN And ShenShen !
PFANNEE From Miss Cringeable &apos;s Twirling Academy !
SHENSHEN Do you remember us ?
13 Galinda clearly doesn &apos;t , but-- GALINDA Of course !
Boq watches , smitten , as Galinda chats with them , then moves toward the STUDENT CHOIR , conducted by the Head Shizstress , MISS CODDLE .
Pfannee and ShenShen follow Galinda ... STUDENT CHOIR O HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE-DRAPED WALLS ... Just then , a BOAT pulls up , unnoticed by them .
It briefly obscures our view of Galinda-- STUDENT CHOIR ( CONT &apos;D ) THE PROUDLIEST SIGHT TH ERE IS A BLACK BOOT steps out and plants itself on the ground .
Then another beside it .
STUDENT CHOIR ( CONT &apos;D ) WHEN GREY AND SERE OUR HAIR HATH TURNED We don &apos;t see who the boots belong to yet .
We &apos;re behind this figure .
A thick braid obscures her neck .
Her hands are shoved in her pockets .
A jacket ( not a Shiz blazer ) and tights cover her arms and legs .
STUDENT CHOIR ( CONT &apos;D ) WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED Stil l behind the figure , we move toward the choir with Galinda and her new friends ...
The figure reaches a green hand up and slowly pulls her braid aside , revealing her green neck .
A FEW STUDENTS notice and gawk .
One drops his suitcase .
STUDENT CHOIR ( CONT &apos;D ) IN OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZ Galinda moves closer to the choir , assuming the whispers and pointing are a response to her Galinda-ness .
STUDENT CHOIR ( CONT &apos;D ) ( not icing the mysterious figure ) OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZZZZ ...
The Choir trails off .
Galinda eagerly fills in for them-- GALINDA OH-OH-OH-OH-OLD ... 14 Mid-VOCALIZING , we watch it dawn on Galinda that everyone around her is staring , slack-jawed , just past her .
She spins around and-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) AHHH ! ! !
Galinda YELPS as she sees the figure in all her green glory .
And so do we .
This is ELPHABA ( 20s , badass .
Her razor sharp mind and tongue serve as armor , to protect her tender soul from moments like these ) .
Galinda stares at her .
Elphaba stares back defiantly .
ELPHABA What ?
What are you staring at ?
Oh-- do I have something in my teeth ?
Galinda is silent , flummoxed by this confrontation .
GALINDA But ... you &apos;re ... green .
ELPHABA I am ?
Elphaba looks around , as if to confirm this .
E LPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Fine .
Let &apos;s get this over with-- ( addressing them all ) No , I &apos;m not seasick ; yes , I &apos;ve always been green ; no , I didn &apos;t eat grass as a child .
Galinda feels everyone watching , musters up her best self-- GALINDA Well , I for one am so sorry that you &apos;re forced to live with-- ( gestures ) This-- ELPHABA Is that so ?
GALINDA Yes , and it &apos;s my intention to major in sorcery , so-- if at some future time you wanted to-- address the problem ?
Perhaps I could-- help .
15 ELPHABA Offering to help someone you don &apos;t know with a skill you don &apos;t have .
I &apos;m sure everyone &apos;s duly impressed .
Galinda , proudly virtuous , makes sure all can hear-- GALINDA I could care less what other people think .
ELPHABA Couldn &apos;t .
GALINDA What ?
ELPHABA You &quot; couldn &apos;t &quot; care less what other people think .
( looks her up and down ) Though I doubt that &apos;s true .
A ripple of tension courses through the crowd , when- - GOVERNOR THROPP ( O.S. )
Elphaba-- !
Governor Thropp appears , with NESSA .
Now also in her 20 &apos;s ; Nessa is beautiful , seemingly shy compared to Elphaba , but with her own brand of inner fierceness .
ELPHABA Oh , and this is my younger sister , Nessarose-- as you can see , she &apos;s a perfectly acceptable color-- As Nessa , embarrassed , tries to disappear , Thropp yanks Elphaba aside , hisses in her ear-- GOVERNOR TH ROPP ( O.S. )
Stop making a spectracle of yourself !
Governor Thropp presents a gift-wrapped bundle to Nessa-- GOVERNOR THROPP ( CONT &apos;D ) My precious little girl-- a parting gift .
NESSA Father-- !
16 With a self-conscious glance at Elphaba , Nessa opens the gift , revealing ... NESSA ( CONT &apos;D ) Jeweled shoes ?
GOVERNOR THROPP So they &apos;ll all see how beautiful you are-- right down to your toes .
Elphaba comes close , as Nessa takes her old shoes off and puts the jeweled ones on , Elphaba whispers to her , contrite .
ELPHABA I shouldn &apos;t have sprouted off like that .
NESSA ( a gentle reproof ) No , you shouldn &apos;t have .
Today is -- ( she breaks off ) ELPHABA The start of your new life .
The sisters regard each other-- they &apos;ve never been apart before .
Saying goodbye is hard ... for both of them .
NESSA I &apos;ll miss you .
Elphaba takes her younger sister &apos;s hand .
ELPHABA No you won &apos;t .
You &apos;ll be having too good a time .
TOWER BELLS RING .
All around them , Students bid goodbye to their loving families , and head for the Main Hall .
Governor Thropp reaches out for Nessa &apos;s chair , but-- ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) NESSA Don &apos;t help her-- Don &apos;t help me-- Nessa waves , and rolls away .
Elphaba , happiness for her sister mixed with a private ache , watches Nessa head off with the others .
Then-- Elphaba glances over at her father .
ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) She &apos;ll be fine .
GOVERNOR THROPP Go with her .
17 ELPHABA What ?
GOVERNOR THROPP Just until she &apos;s safely settled in her room .
Make sure she has everything she needs .
ELPHABA Father , she &apos;s on her own now , I can &apos;t just-- GOVERNOR THROPP Stop jabbering and do as I say !
Elphaba is startled-- not by his harshness , she &apos;s used to that .
By the tears in his eyes .
He lowers his voice .
GOVERNOR THROPP ( CONT &apos;D ) Please .
If anything should happen to her-- She can &apos;t refuse .
20-21 20-21 OM ITTED 22 22 EXT .
SHIZ - QUAD Elphaba approaches the impressive quad , pausing to admire : an archway carved with a striking fresco depicting historical Ozian Animals .
Then , above this , she spots-- A CARVING OF THE WIZARD .
Elphaba stares up at it , in awe .
His carved arm is outstretched , as if reaching out to her ... She steps through the archway to find-- The SHIZ PRESIDENT , at a podium , surrounded by seated ( human ) FACULTY MEMB ERS .
A well-dressed SHOEBILL-BIRD and a distinguished-looking , bespectacled Goat , DOCTOR DILLAMOND , the only Animal faculty members , are positioned at the edge of the platform , a slight distance from the others .
SHIZ PRESIDENT ... and rounding out the rest of our faculty , we have two scholars , eminent in their respective fields of Forestry and Agriculture ... TWO HUMAN PROFESSORS stand , to POLITE APPL AUSE .
IN THE AUDIENCE : Among the STUDENTS , we find Nessa , in one of the aisles .
Boq is seated not far behind her and nearby , Galinda sits with Pfannee and ShenShen .
18 IN THE BACK OF THE QUAD : Elphaba enters quietly , unnoticed ... SHIZ PRESIDENT ( CONT &apos;D ) As well as Professor Mombi , of the Biological Arts ... And of course , the head of our History department , Doctor Dillamond .
Mombi , the Bird , and Doctor Dillamond , the Goat , step forward .
But-- there &apos;s no applause .
IN THE BACK OF THE QUAD , Elphaba takes this in , as UP AT THE PODIUM : The President CLEARS HIS THROAT ... SHIZ PRESIDENT ( CONT &apos;D ) Finally ...
In today &apos;s Oz , a real sorceress , one who possesses true magic , has become all too rare ... A ripple of excitement spreads across the room .
Galinda sits up straighter , in anticipation .
SHIZ PRESIDENT ( CONT &apos;D ) Which is why we are so privileged to have , here at Shiz , our esteemed Professor Emeritus and Dean of Sorcery Studies ... Madame Morrible .
EXCITED APPLAUSE .
Everyone leaps to their feet , as-- An elegant woman appears in the back of the hall , charisma radiating from her like a magnetic charge .
This is MADAME MORRIBLE .
As she makes her way down the aisle and up the steps of the platform , all eyes are on her .
Nessa , her view now blocked by everyone standing up , cranes to ge t a glimpse of Morrible .
Her eyes meet Boq &apos;s , also struggling to see .
They share a wry smile ... Galinda stares , starstruck , at Madame Morrible .
GALINDA It &apos;s really her !
( whispers to her friends ) Madame Morrible is why I applied to Shiz !
They say she &apos;s been looking for someone to mentorize , and it &apos;s my dream to someday fill her shoes !
( clocking her shoes ) Which are amazing .
Morrible , now at the podium , looks out at the students .
19 MORRIBLE Welcome new students .
And congratulotions , on having been accepted to Shiz .
Whether you &apos;ll be studying Law , Logic , or Linguification , I know I speak for my fellow faculty members when I say that we have nothing but the highest hopes .
For some of you .
Galinda perks up , positive Morrible is speaking only of her .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) And now-- Miss Coddle , if you please ...
The perennially anxious Miss Coddl e steps up to the podium-- MISS CODDLE I am Miss Coddle , Head Shizstress .
And these are your dormitory designations and room assignments !
Miss Coddle signals , and five ASSISTANTS appear at the sides of the room , holding ornate poles with scrolls attached to the top .
In unison , they pull a ribbon-- scrolls unfurl , revealing the room assignments .
BUZZING excitedly , the Students rush to locate themselve s on the lists .
All except Galinda , who ( tailed by Pfannee and ShenShen ) moves purposefully toward Madame Morrible .
GALINDA Madame Morrible ? !
Morrible , steps down from the platform and sees-- GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) I am Galinda Upland .
Of the Upper Uplands ?
MORRIBLE If this is regarding room assignments-- GALINDA Oh , no ...
Thank you so much for asking , but I &apos;ve already been assigned a private suite .
Then , realiz ing that Pfannee and ShenShen are listening-- 20 GALINDA ( CONT &apos;D ) But you can of course come visit me whenever you want !
Impressed by her generosity , they murmur to each other-- SHENSHEN PFANNEE Awww ! !
She &apos;s so good !
PFANNEE ( CONT &apos;D ) ( to Galinda ) You &apos;re so good !
Morrible , unimpressed , heads for the exit .
Undauntable , Galinda follows determinedly after her-- GALINDA No , it &apos;s about my application to your sorcery seminar !
MORRIBLE I do not teach my seminar every semester .
Of course , if someone very special were to come along--- Morrible starts to walk away from Galinda .
GALINDA Well , naturally !
Which is why I wanted to talk to you ...
But Morrible just keeps walking .
Galinda frowns at Pfannee and ShenShen , frustrated , as ... BY THE LAST ROOM ASSIGNMENT SCROLL : Nessa is searching for her name , when-- MISS CODDLE There you are !
Miss Nessarose , isn &apos;t it ?
The Governor &apos;s daughter ?
( taking Nessa in ) How tragically beautiful you are .
It &apos;s an honor to-- AHHH !
Miss Coddle involuntarily yelps , startled by the sight of Elphaba , who has just appeared .
Hearing this yelp , Morrible turns and observes , as-- ELPHABA I &apos;m the other daughter .
I &apos;m beautifully tragic .
21 NESSA Elphaba-- ?
MISS CODDLE ( rattled ) The other daughter ?
I wasn &apos;t-- made aware , but-- not to fret , just a slight gulch , we &apos;ll find someplace to hide you-- I mean house you !
ELPHABA No , I &apos;m not enrolled .
MISS CODDLE Oh good .
Though I &apos;m sure you &apos;re ... very bright .
Galinda overhears this , turns to Pfannee and ShenShen-- GALINDA Bright ?
She &apos;s phosphorescent !
Everyone LAUGHS , including Boq .
Elphaba hears them and her eyes flash with anger .
Nessa , embarrassed , whispers-- NESSA Why are you still here ?
ELPHABA Forgive me Nessa , Father insisted-- MISS CODDLE ( interrupts ) Oh , the Governor made his concern for your sister quite apparent-- Please assure him I &apos;m honored to help her .
Miss Coddle moves towards Nessa .
NESSA Wait , what ?
ELPHABA Oh , no , she doesn &apos;t need your help .
NESSA ( to Elphaba ) Or yours .
( to Coddle ) I just need to find my room .
MISS CODDLE I &apos;ll bring you there myself !
22 Miss Coddle takes hold of Nessa &apos;s chair-- NESSA No , I meant-- wait-- !
I can find my own way ...
But Miss Coddle starts to push Nessa &apos;s chair-- ELPHABA Miss Coddle-- no !
But Coddle keeps pushing .
Elphaba sees Nessa &apos;s distress ... ELPHABA ( CONT &apos;D ) Stop !
She doesn &apos;t need you to-- As Miss Coddle struggles to push Nessa &apos;s wheelchair-- it starts to move backwards , as if pulled by some unseen force .
Nessa sees light fixtures begin to bend off the wall .
Water from a nearby fountain starts to lean .
NESSA ( a frightened whisper ) Oh no !
Elphaba-- Miss Coddle struggles to lift her feet off the ground .
She &apos;s stuck , weighed down by a sudden , forceful gravity .
Pfannee and ShenShen clutch each other in fear but Galinda can &apos;t take her eyes off what &apos;s happening .
The chairs in the quad begin sliding towards Elphaba , whose anger mounts as Miss Coddle struggles , until-- ELPHABA LET .
HER .
GO ! !
Nessa &apos;s wheelchair breaks out of Miss Coddle &apos;s hands and rises into the air .
People watch in shock .
Elphaba &apos;s eyes are locked on Nessa .
The wheels of Nessa &apos;s chair begin to spin until they suddenly stop .
Nessa drops back down to earth .
Coddle can finally walk again-- her feet freed from the gravitational pull .
Elphaba grabs the wheelchair and helps pull it back down .
She EXHALES , Nessa is safe ... FROM HIGH ABOVE : we see Elphaba and Nessa at the center of the group of st unned students , the chairs of the quad piled up around them .
23 ON MORRIBLE : She &apos;s been observing all this closely ... NESSA ( devastated ) This was my chance .
My new start .
ELPHABA Oh Nessa-- I &apos;m so sorry-- The students who haven &apos;t fled now stare at Elphaba with shock and fear .
Morrible clocks this and quickly calls out-- MORRIBLE Magic is merely the mind &apos;s attempt to wrap itself around the impossible .
Yes : I did that ... ( everyone reacts ) ... to prepare you to expect th e unexpected here at Shiz .
The students regard Morrible with awe , and break into APPLAUSE , as Nessa and Elphaba share a private look of surprised relief .
Then Nessa heads out , on her own ... ON GALINDA : She &apos;s blown away-- GALINDA ( to Pfannee and ShenShen ) Did you visually see that ?
I simply must get into her seminar !
MORRIBLE And speaking of the unexpected ... Morrible turns to Galinda and the other gi rls-- MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) Which of you young ladies will volunteer to share with-- GALINDA ( calls out ) Madame Morrible-- ?
MORRIBLE Oh , thank you dear .
That is very good of you .
GALINDA Wait , what ?
MORRIBLE Miss-- Elphaba , is it-- ?
You can room with Miss Galinda !
24 ELPHABA What ? !
GALINDA But , Madame Morrible-- MORRIBLE Go now .
All of you .
The Students leave the quad .
Galinda stops , turning back to look again-- first at Morrible , then at Elphaba , because ... there must be some mistake ... and then she hears-- MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) You .
Come with me .
Galinda smiles , relieved and thrilled-- GALINDA Well , of course !
Galinda starts towards Morrible-- MORRIBLE No .
Not you .
( turns to Elphaba ) You .
Galinda stops short .
Both girls are deeply confused .
MORRIBLE ( CONT &apos;D ) ( to Elphaba ) I shall tutor you privately .
And take no other students .
